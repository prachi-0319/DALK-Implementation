23089633|t|Associations between gonadotropins, testosterone and beta amyloid in men at risk of Alzheimer's disease.
23089633|a|Testosterone and gonadotropins have been associated with cognitive decline in men and the modulation of beta amyloid (Abeta) metabolism. The relatively few studies that have investigated whether changes in one or a combination of these hormones influence Abeta levels have focused primarily on plasma Abeta(1-40) and not on the more pathogenic Abeta(1-42). Currently, no study has investigated whether these hormones are associated with an increase in brain amyloid deposition, ante mortem. Through the highly characterised Australian imaging, biomarkers and lifestyle study, we have determined the impact of these hormones on plasma Abeta levels and brain amyloid burden (Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) retention). Spearman's rank correlation and linear regression analysis was carried out across the cohort and within subclassifications. Luteinizing hormone (LH) was the only variable shown, in the total cohort, to have a significant impact on plasma Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) levels (beta=0.163, P<0.001; beta=0.446, P<0.001). This held in subjective memory complainers (SMC) (Abeta(1-40); beta=0.208, P=0.017; Abeta(1-42); beta=0.215, P=0.017) but was absent in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) groups. In SMC, increased frequency of the APOE-e4 allele (beta=0.536, P<0.001) and increasing serum LH levels (beta=0.421, P=0.004) had a significant impact on PiB retention. Whereas in MCI, PiB retention was associated with increased APOE-e4 allele copy number (beta=0.674, P<0.001) and decreasing calculated free testosterone (beta=-0.303, P=0.043). These findings suggest a potential progressive involvement of LH and testosterone in the early preclinical stages of AD. Furthermore, these hormones should be considered while attempting to predict AD at these earliest stages of the disease.

23164821|t|Clusterin regulates beta-amyloid toxicity via Dickkopf-1-driven induction of the wnt-PCP-JNK pathway.
23164821|a|Although the mechanism of Abeta action in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has remained elusive, it is known to increase the expression of the antagonist of canonical wnt signalling, Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1), whereas the silencing of Dkk1 blocks Abeta neurotoxicity. We asked if clusterin, known to be regulated by wnt, is part of an Abeta/Dkk1 neurotoxic pathway. Knockdown of clusterin in primary neurons reduced Abeta toxicity and DKK1 upregulation and, conversely, Abeta increased intracellular clusterin and decreased clusterin protein secretion, resulting in the p53-dependent induction of DKK1. To further elucidate how the clusterin-dependent induction of Dkk1 by Abeta mediates neurotoxicity, we measured the effects of Abeta and Dkk1 protein on whole-genome expression in primary neurons, finding a common pathway suggestive of activation of wnt-planar cell polarity (PCP)-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signalling leading to the induction of genes including EGR1 (early growth response-1), NAB2 (Ngfi-A-binding protein-2) and KLF10 (Kruppel-like factor-10) that, when individually silenced, protected against Abeta neurotoxicity and/or tau phosphorylation. Neuronal overexpression of Dkk1 in transgenic mice mimicked this Abeta-induced pathway and resulted in age-dependent increases in tau phosphorylation in hippocampus and cognitive impairment. Furthermore, we show that this Dkk1/wnt-PCP-JNK pathway is active in an Abeta-based mouse model of AD and in AD brain, but not in a tau-based mouse model or in frontotemporal dementia brain. Thus, we have identified a pathway whereby Abeta induces a clusterin/p53/Dkk1/wnt-PCP-JNK pathway, which drives the upregulation of several genes that mediate the development of AD-like neuropathologies, thereby providing new mechanistic insights into the action of Abeta in neurodegenerative diseases.

23402285|t|Effects of ethanol on aggregation, serotonin release, and amyloid precursor protein processing in rat and human platelets.
23402285|a|It is known that oxidative stress leads to amyloid precursor protein (APP) dysregulation in platelets. Ethanol (EtOH) is a vascular risk factor and induces oxidative stress. The aim of the present study was thus to investigate whether EtOH affects APP processing in rat and human platelets. Platelets were exposed to 50 mM EtOH with and without 2 mM calcium-chloride (CaCl2) for 20 or 180 minutes at 37 C. Platelet aggregation, serotonin release and APP isoforms 130 and 106/110 kDa were analyzed. As a control, 100 mM H2O2 was tested in rat platelets. Our data show that EtOH alone did not affect any of the analyzed parameters, whereas CaCl2 significantly increased aggregation of rat and human platelets. In addition, CaCl2 alone enhanced serotonin release in rat platelets. EtOH counteracted CaCl2-induced aggregation and serotonin release. In the presence of CaCl2, EtOH reduced the 130 kDa APP isoform in rat and human platelets. In conclusion, this study shows that in the presence of CaCl2, EtOH affects the platelet function and APP processing in rat and human platelets.

23404748|t|The parahippocampal gyrus links the default-mode cortical network with the medial temporal lobe memory system.
23404748|a|The default-mode network (DMN) is a distributed functional-anatomic network implicated in supporting memory. Current resting-state functional connectivity studies in humans remain divided on the exact involvement of medial temporal lobe (MTL) in this network at rest. Notably, it is unclear to what extent the MTL regions involved in successful memory encoding are connected to the cortical nodes of the DMN during resting state. Our findings using functional connectivity MRI analyses of resting-state data indicate that the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) is the primary hub of the DMN in the MTL during resting state. Also, connectivity of the PHG is distinct from connectivity of hippocampal regions identified by an associative memory-encoding task. We confirmed that several hippocampal encoding regions lack significant functional connectivity with cortical DMN nodes during resting state. Additionally, a mediation analysis showed that resting-state connectivity between the hippocampus and posterior cingulate cortex--a major hub of the DMN--is indirect and mediated by the PHG. Our findings support the hypothesis that the MTL memory system represents a functional subnetwork that relates to the cortical nodes of the DMN through parahippocampal functional connections.

23419831|t|APOE and BCHE as modulators of cerebral amyloid deposition: a florbetapir PET genome-wide association study.
23419831|a|Deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the cerebral cortex is thought to be a pivotal event in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis with a significant genetic contribution. Molecular imaging can provide an early noninvasive phenotype, but small samples have prohibited genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of cortical Abeta load until now. We employed florbetapir ((18)F) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to assess brain Abeta levels in vivo for 555 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). More than six million common genetic variants were tested for association to quantitative global cortical Abeta load controlling for age, gender and diagnosis. Independent genome-wide significant associations were identified on chromosome 19 within APOE (apolipoprotein E) (rs429358, P=5.5 x 10(-14)) and on chromosome 3 upstream of BCHE (butyrylcholinesterase) (rs509208, P=2.7 x 10(-8)) in a region previously associated with serum BCHE activity. Together, these loci explained 15% of the variance in cortical Abeta levels in this sample (APOE 10.7%, BCHE 4.3%). Suggestive associations were identified within ITGA6, near EFNA5, EDIL3, ITGA1, PIK3R1, NFIB and ARID1B, and between NUAK1 and C12orf75. These results confirm the association of APOE with Abeta deposition and represent the largest known effect of BCHE on an AD-related phenotype. BCHE has been found in senile plaques and this new association of genetic variation at the BCHE locus with Abeta burden in humans may have implications for potential disease-modifying effects of BCHE-modulating agents in the AD spectrum.

23478745|t|Gene knockout of 5-lipoxygenase rescues synaptic dysfunction and improves memory in the triple-transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease.
23478745|a|5-Lipoxygenase (5LO) is upregulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in vivo modulates the amyloidotic phenotype of amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice. However, no data are available on the effects that 5LO has on synaptic function, integrity and cognition. To address this issue, we used a genetic and a pharmacological approach by generating 3 x Tg mice deficient for 5LO and administering 3 x Tg mice with a 5LO inhibitor. Compared with controls, we found that even before the development of overt neuropathology, both animals manifested significant memory improvement, rescue of their synaptic dysfunction and amelioration of synaptic integrity. In addition, later in life, these mice had a significant reduction of Abeta and tau pathology. Our findings support a novel functional role for 5LO in regulating synaptic plasticity and memory. They establish this protein as a pleiotropic contributor to the development of the full spectrum of the AD phenotype, making it a valid therapeutic target for the treatment of AD.

23491263|t|Changes in plasma amyloid beta in a longitudinal study of aging and Alzheimer's disease.
23491263|a|BACKGROUND: A practical biomarker is required to facilitate the preclinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Plasma amyloid beta (Abeta)1-40, Abeta1-42, Abetan-40, and Abetan-42 peptides were measured at baseline and after 18 months in 771 participants from the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study of aging. Abeta peptide levels were compared with clinical pathology, neuroimaging and neuropsychological measurements. RESULTS: Although inflammatory and renal function covariates influenced plasma Abeta levels significantly, a decrease in Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 was observed in patients with AD, and was also inversely correlated with neocortical amyloid burden. During the 18 months, plasma Abeta1-42 decreased in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and in those transitioning from healthy to MCI. CONCLUSION: Our findings are consistent with a number of published plasma Abeta studies and, although the prognostic value of individual measures in any given subject is limited, the diagnostic contribution of plasma Abeta may demonstrate utility when combined with a panel of peripheral biomarkers.

23507145|t|Cyclophilin D deficiency rescues Abeta-impaired PKA/CREB signaling and alleviates synaptic degeneration.
23507145|a|The coexistence of neuronal mitochondrial pathology and synaptic dysfunction is an early pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cyclophilin D (CypD), an integral part of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), is involved in amyloid beta (Abeta)-instigated mitochondrial dysfunction. Blockade of CypD prevents Abeta-induced mitochondrial malfunction and the consequent cognitive impairments. Here, we showed the elimination of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by antioxidants probucol or superoxide dismutase (SOD)/catalase blocks Abeta-mediated inactivation of protein kinase A (PKA)/cAMP regulatory-element-binding (CREB) signal transduction pathway and loss of synapse, suggesting the detrimental effects of oxidative stress on neuronal PKA/CREB activity. Notably, neurons lacking CypD significantly attenuate Abeta-induced ROS. Consequently, CypD-deficient neurons are resistant to Abeta-disrupted PKA/CREB signaling by increased PKA activity, phosphorylation of PKA catalytic subunit (PKA C), and CREB. In parallel, lack of CypD protects neurons from Abeta-induced loss of synapses and synaptic dysfunction. Furthermore, compared to the mAPP mice, CypD-deficient mAPP mice reveal less inactivation of PKA-CREB activity and increased synaptic density, attenuate abnormalities in dendritic spine maturation, and improve spontaneous synaptic activity. These findings provide new insights into a mechanism in the crosstalk between the CypD-dependent mitochondrial oxidative stress and signaling cascade, leading to synaptic injury, functioning through the PKA/CREB signal transduction pathway.

23628985|t|A blood-based predictor for neocortical Abeta burden in Alzheimer's disease: results from the AIBL study.
23628985|a|Dementia is a global epidemic with Alzheimer's disease (AD) being the leading cause. Early identification of patients at risk of developing AD is now becoming an international priority. Neocortical Abeta (extracellular beta-amyloid) burden (NAB), as assessed by positron emission tomography (PET), represents one such marker for early identification. These scans are expensive and are not widely available, thus, there is a need for cheaper and more widely accessible alternatives. Addressing this need, a blood biomarker-based signature having efficacy for the prediction of NAB and which can be easily adapted for population screening is described. Blood data (176 analytes measured in plasma) and Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB)-PET measurements from 273 participants from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study were utilised. Univariate analysis was conducted to assess the difference of plasma measures between high and low NAB groups, and cross-validated machine-learning models were generated for predicting NAB. These models were applied to 817 non-imaged AIBL subjects and 82 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) for validation. Five analytes showed significant difference between subjects with high compared to low NAB. A machine-learning model (based on nine markers) achieved sensitivity and specificity of 80 and 82%, respectively, for predicting NAB. Validation using the ADNI cohort yielded similar results (sensitivity 79% and specificity 76%). These results show that a panel of blood-based biomarkers is able to accurately predict NAB, supporting the hypothesis for a relationship between a blood-based signature and Abeta accumulation, therefore, providing a platform for developing a population-based screen.

23641861|t|Protective role of DNJ-27/ERdj5 in Caenorhabditis elegans models of human neurodegenerative diseases.
23641861|a|AIMS: Cells have developed quality control systems for protection against proteotoxicity. Misfolded and aggregation-prone proteins, which are behind the initiation and progression of many neurodegenerative diseases (ND), are known to challenge the proteostasis network of the cells. We aimed to explore the role of DNJ-27/ERdj5, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident thioredoxin protein required as a disulfide reductase for the degradation of misfolded proteins, in well-established Caenorhabditis elegans models of Alzheimer, Parkinson and Huntington diseases. RESULTS: We demonstrate that DNJ-27 is an ER luminal protein and that its expression is induced upon ER stress via IRE-1/XBP-1. When dnj-27 expression is downregulated by RNA interference we find an increase in the aggregation and associated pathological phenotypes (paralysis and motility impairment) caused by human beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta), alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) and polyglutamine (polyQ) proteins. In turn, DNJ-27 overexpression ameliorates these deleterious phenotypes. Surprisingly, despite being an ER-resident protein, we show that dnj-27 downregulation alters cytoplasmic protein homeostasis and causes mitochondrial fragmentation. We further demonstrate that DNJ-27 overexpression substantially protects against the mitochondrial fragmentation caused by human Abeta and alpha-syn peptides in these worm models. INNOVATION: We identify C. elegans dnj-27 as a novel protective gene for the toxicity associated with the expression of human Abeta, alpha-syn and polyQ proteins, implying a protective role of ERdj5 in Alzheimer, Parkinson and Huntington diseases. CONCLUSION: Our data support a scenario where the levels of DNJ-27/ERdj5 in the ER impact cytoplasmic protein homeostasis and the integrity of the mitochondrial network which might underlie its protective effects in models of proteotoxicity associated to human ND.

23643457|t|Implications of early treatment among Medicaid patients with Alzheimer's disease.
23643457|a|OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the effect of treatment timing on risk of institutionalization of Medicaid patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to estimate the economic implications of earlier diagnosis and treatment initiation. METHODS: New Jersey Medicaid claims data (1997-2009) were used retrospectively to study the effect of treatment on time to institutionalization. Observed Medicaid payments were used to calculate savings from delayed institutionalization, adjusting for cost offsets resulting from concurrent changes in use of other medical services. RESULTS: Initiation of existing therapies at earliest symptomatic onset is predicted to delay institutionalization by 91 days, reducing Medicaid costs by $19,108/institutionalized patient. Incorporating an 18.5% cost offset from increased use of other medical services as well as drug costs associated with earlier treatment results in net savings of $12,687/patient. Projected annual Medicaid savings exceed $1 billion. CONCLUSION: Earlier treatment leads to a small delay in institutionalization among AD patients, resulting in significant costs savings to Medicaid.

23651588|t|Intermittent oral coadministration of a gamma secretase inhibitor with dexamethasone mitigates intestinal goblet cell hyperplasia in rats.
23651588|a|Dexamethasone was given in 2 oral dosing regimens with repeat dose oral administration of the gamma secretase inhibitor (GSI), PF-03084014, in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats in order to evaluate the effects of coadministration of dexamethasone on GSI-induced goblet cell hyperplasia (GCH) in the intestinal tract. Safety end points were evaluated in 1 week and 1 month studies. The dosing regimens tested in the 1-month studies included a 1-week pretreatment with 1.0 mg/kg dexamethasone followed by a 3-week repeat dose treatment with 100 mg/kg GSI or concurrent intermittent treatment with 1.0 mg/kg dexamethasone on weeks 1 and 3 and repeat dose treatment with 100 mg/kg GSI for 4 weeks. Pretreatment with dexamethasone for 1 week transiently mitigated the severity of intestinal GCH for up to 1 week. Intermittent coadministration of dexamethasone on weeks 1 and 3 with GSI repeat dosing for 4 weeks mitigated intestinal GCH for up to 4 weeks post treatment. Treatment-related morbidity and mortality occurred on day 7 with 150 mg/kg GSI and 5 mg/kg dexamethasone coadministration, and on days 13, 14, and 23 with 100 mg/kg GSI and 1 mg/kg dexamethasone coadministration.

23712002|t|Cortical phase changes in Alzheimer's disease at 7T MRI: a novel imaging marker.
23712002|a|BACKGROUND: Postmortem studies have indicated the potential of high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to visualize amyloid depositions in the cerebral cortex. The aim of this study is to test this hypothesis in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: T2*-weighted MRI was performed in 16 AD patients and 15 control subjects. All magnetic resonance images were scored qualitatively by visual assessment, and quantitatively by measuring phase shifts in the cortical gray matter and hippocampus. Statistical analysis was performed to assess differences between groups. RESULTS: Patients with AD demonstrated an increased phase shift in the cortex in the temporoparietal, frontal, and parietal regions (P < .005), and this was associated with individual Mini-Mental State Examination scores (r = -0.54, P < .05). CONCLUSION: Increased cortical phase shift in AD patients demonstrated on 7-tesla T2*-weighted MRI is a potential new biomarker for AD, which may reflect amyloid pathology in the early stages.

23713771|t|Molecular characterization of the hetero-assembly of beta-amyloid peptide with islet amyloid polypeptide.
23713771|a|Increasing amounts of evidence suggest that Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are linked to each other. We have recently identified in vitro a high affinity interaction between beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) of AD and islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) of T2D which results in the formation of non-fibrillar and non-cytotoxic Abeta-IAPP hetero-oligomers. The Abeta-IAPP interaction delays cytotoxic self-association of both polypeptides albeit it is unable to block it. In this context, IAPP-GI, a soluble conformationally constrained mimic of a non-amyloidogenic and non-toxic IAPP conformer, completely blocks Abeta amyloidogenesis and cytotoxicity. Here we studied the hetero-association pathways of Abeta with IAPP and with IAPP-GI. We found that preformed Abeta or IAPP fibrils and cytotoxic assemblies are able to seed amyloidogenesis and cytotoxicity in Abeta-IAPP but not in Abeta-IAPP-GI solutions. Initially non-fibrillar and non-toxic Abeta-IAPP but not Abeta-IAPP-GI hetero-oligomers were found to further aggregate into hetero-fibrils and cytotoxic assemblies in a process strongly enhanced under Abeta or IAPP self-assembly promoting conditions. Importantly, our studies provided evidence that initially non-fibrillar and non-toxic Abeta-IAPP hetero-oligomers are able to misfold into hetero-fibrils and indicated a crucial role of the strong amyloidogenic character of IAPP in this process. These results uncover a novel molecular property of the Abeta and IAPP sequences, i.e. their ability to form hetero-fibrils, and offer mechanistic support to a model linking Abeta and IAPP hetero-association to their cytotoxic self-association pathways and thus likely to the pathogenesis of AD and T2D.

23715750|t|Effects of triptolide on degeneration of dendritic spines induced by Abeta1-40 injection in rat hippocampus.
23715750|a|Although the exact cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains elusive, mounting evidence continues to support the involvement of neuroinflammation in the development of AD. Triptolide isolated from the herb Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F has anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activities. In this study, we observed the effects of triptolide on dendritic spines of hippocampal neurons in model rats with AD. Thirty male SD rats were randomly divided into control group, AD model group and triptolide-treated group. The AD model group was made with bilateral microinjection of aggregated beta-amyloid protein (Abeta)1-40 into hippocampus in rats and the control group rats were injected with normal saline in the same way. The triptolide-treated group rats were administered triptolide intraperitoneally for 30 days after microinjection of aggregated Abeta1-40 into hippocampus. Dendritic morphology of hippocampal neurons in each group was analyzed using Golgi staining and ImageJ software. Our data showed that the total number of intersection points of dendrites and spine density in hippocampal neurons in the AD model group were decreased as compared with the control group. However, the total number of intersection points of dendrites and spine density in hippocampal neurons in the triptolide-treated group were increased as compared with the AD model group. Our results indicate that triptolide can alleviate the degeneration of dendritic spines in hippocampal neurons in model rats with AD.

23716278|t|Neurotrophin receptor p75 mediates the uptake of the amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide, guiding it to lysosomes for degradation in basal forebrain cholinergic neurons.
23716278|a|A fascinating yet perhaps overlooked trait of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)) is its ability to bind ligands with no obvious neurotrophic function. Using cultured basal forebrain (BF) neurons, this study demonstrates selective internalization of amyloid beta (Abeta) 1-42 in conjunction with p75(NTR) (labelled with IgG192-Cy3) by cholinergic cells. Active under resting conditions, this process was enhanced by high K(+) stimulation and was insensitive to inhibitors of regulated synaptic activity-tetrodotoxin or botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT type/A and/B). Blockade of sarco-endoplasmic reticulum (SERCA) Ca(2+) ATPase with thapsigargin and CPA or chelation of Ca(2+) with EGTA-AM strongly suppressed the endocytosis of p75(NTR), implicating the role of ER released Ca(2+). The uptake of IgG192-Cy3 was also reduced by T-type Ca(2+) channel blocker mibefradil but not Cd(2+), an indiscriminate blocker of high voltage-activated Ca(2+) currents. A strong co-localization of IgG192-Cy3 with late endosome (Rab7) or lysosome (Lamp1) qualifier proteins suggest these compartments as the primary destination for internalized IgG192 and Abeta. Selective uptake and labeling of BF cholinergic cells with IgG192-Cy3 injected into the prefrontal cortex was verified also in vivo. The significance of these findings in relation to Abeta clearance in the cerebral cortex and pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease is discussed.

23727081|t|Variants in PPP3R1 and MAPT are associated with more rapid functional decline in Alzheimer's disease: the Cache County Dementia Progression Study.
23727081|a|BACKGROUND: Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the gene encoding the regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase 2B (PPP3R1, rs1868402) and the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT, rs3785883) gene were recently associated with higher cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau levels in samples from the Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at Washington University (WU) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). In these same samples, these SNPs were also associated with faster functional decline, or progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes scores (CDR-sb). We attempted to validate the latter association in an independent, population-based sample of incident AD cases from the Cache County Dementia Progression Study (DPS). METHODS: All 92 AD cases from the DPS with a global CDR-sb <=1 (mild) at initial clinical assessment who were later assessed on CDR-sb data on at least two other time points were genotyped at the two SNPs of interest (rs1868402 and rs3785883). We used linear mixed models to estimate associations between these SNPs and CDR-sb trajectory. All analyses were performed using Proc Mixed in SAS. RESULTS: Although we observed no association between rs3785883 or rs1868402 alone and change in CDR-sb (P > .10), there was a significant association between a combined genotype model and change in CDR-sb: carriers of the high-risk genotypes at both loci progressed >2.9 times faster than noncarriers (P = .015). When data from DPS were combined with previously published data from WU and ADNI, change in CDR-sb was 30% faster for each copy of the high-risk allele at rs3785883 (P = .0082) and carriers of both high-risk genotypes at both loci progressed 6 times faster (P < .0001) than all others combined. CONCLUSIONS: We replicate a previous report by Cruchaga et al that specific variations in rs3785883 and rs1868402 are associated with accelerated progression of AD. Further characterization of this association will provide a better understanding of how genetic factors influence the rate of progression of AD and could provide novel insights into preventative and therapeutic strategies.

23733394|t|Guanidine hydrochloride denaturation of dopamine-induced alpha-synuclein oligomers: a small-angle X-ray scattering study.
23733394|a|Alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) forms the amyloid-containing Lewy bodies found in the brain in Parkinson's disease. The neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) reacts with alpha-syn to form SDS-resistant soluble, non-amyloid, and melanin-containing oligomers. Their toxicity is debated, as is the nature of their structure and their relation to amyloid-forming conformers of alpha-syn. The small-angle X-ray scattering technique in combination with modeling by the ensemble optimization method showed that the un-reacted native protein populated three broad classes of conformer, while reaction with DA gave a restricted ensemble range suggesting that the rigid melanin molecule played an important part in their structure. We found that 6 M guanidine hydrochloride did not dissociate alpha-syn DA-reacted dimers and trimers, suggesting covalent linkages. The pathological significance of covalent association is that if they are non-toxic, the oligomers would act as a sink for toxic excess DA and alpha-syn; if toxic, their stability could enhance their toxicity. We argue it is essential, therefore, to resolve the question of whether they are toxic or not.

23752245|t|Rare autosomal copy number variations in early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease.
23752245|a|Over 200 rare and fully penetrant pathogenic mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 and 2 (PSEN1 and PSEN2) cause a subset of early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (EO-FAD). Of these, 21 cases of EO-FAD families carrying unique APP locus duplications remain the only pathogenic copy number variations (CNVs) identified to date in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using high-density DNA microarrays, we performed a comprehensive genome-wide analysis for the presence of rare CNVs in 261 EO-FAD and early/mixed-onset pedigrees. Our analysis revealed 10 novel private CNVs in 10 EO-FAD families overlapping a set of genes that includes: A2BP1, ABAT, CDH2, CRMP1, DMRT1, EPHA5, EPHA6, ERMP1, EVC, EVC2, FLJ35024 and VLDLR. In addition, CNVs encompassing two known frontotemporal dementia genes, CHMP2B and MAPT were found. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting rare gene-rich CNVs in EO-FAD and early/mixed-onset AD that are likely to underlie pathogenicity in familial AD and perhaps related dementias.

23850330|t|CSF Abeta1-42 combined with neuroimaging biomarkers in the early detection, diagnosis and prediction of Alzheimer's disease.
23850330|a|The development of validated, qualified, and standardized biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) that allow for an early presymptomatic diagnosis and discrimination (classification) from other types of dementia and neurodegenerative diseases is warranted to accelerate the successful development of novel disease-modifying therapies. Here, we focus on the value of the 42-residue-long amyloid beta isoform (Abeta1-42) peptide in the cerebrospinal fluid as the core, feasible neurobiochemical marker for the amyloidogenic mechanisms in early-onset familial and late-onset sporadic AD. We discuss the role and use of Abeta1-42 in combination with evolving neuroimaging biomarkers in AD detection and diagnosis. Multimodal neuroimaging techniques, directly providing structural-functional-metabolic aspects of brain pathophysiology, are supportive to predict and monitor the progression of the disease. Advances in multimodal neuroimaging provide new insights into brain organization and enable the detection of specific proteins and/or protein aggregates associated with AD. The combination of biomarkers from different methodologies is believed to be of incrementally added risk-value to accurately identify asymptomatic and prodromal individuals who will likely progress to dementia and represent rational biomarker candidates for preventive and symptomatic pharmacological intervention trials.

23916838|t|Epitope-based DNA vaccine for Alzheimer's disease: translational study in macaques.
23916838|a|BACKGROUND: Clinical trials with passive and active Alzheimer's disease (AD) vaccines suggest that early interventions are needed for improvement of cognitive and/or functional performance in patients, providing impetus for the development of safe and immunologically potent active vaccines targeting amyloid beta (Abeta). The AN-1792 trial has indicated that Abeta-specific T cells may be unsafe for humans; therefore, other vaccines based on small Abeta epitopes are undergoing preclinical and clinical testing. METHODS: Humoral and cellular immune responses elicited in response to a novel DNA epitope-based vaccine (AV-1955) delivered to rhesus macaques using the TriGrid electroporation device were evaluated. Functional activities of anti-Abeta antibodies generated in response to vaccination were assessed in vitro. RESULTS: AV-1955 generates long-term, potent anti-Abeta antibodies and cellular immune responses specific to foreign T-helper epitopes but not to self-Abeta. CONCLUSIONS: This translational study demonstrates that a DNA-based epitope vaccine for AD could be appropriate for human clinical testing.

23919567|t|Mechanism of cholesterol-assisted oligomeric channel formation by a short Alzheimer beta-amyloid peptide.
23919567|a|Alzheimer beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides can self-organize into oligomeric ion channels with high neurotoxicity potential. Cholesterol is believed to play a key role in this process, but the molecular mechanisms linking cholesterol and amyloid channel formation have so far remained elusive. Here, we show that the short Abeta22-35 peptide, which encompasses the cholesterol-binding domain of Abeta, induces a specific increase of Ca(2+) levels in neural cells. This effect is neither observed in calcium-free medium nor in cholesterol-depleted cells, and is inhibited by zinc, a blocker of amyloid channel activity. Double mutations V24G/K28G and N27R/K28R in Abeta22-35 modify cholesterol binding and abrogate channel formation. Molecular dynamic simulations suggest that cholesterol induces a tilted alpha-helical topology of Abeta22-35. This facilitates the establishment of an inter-peptide hydrogen bond network involving Asn-27 and Lys-28, a key step in the octamerization of Abeta22-35 which proceeds gradually until the formation of a perfect annular channel in a phosphatidylcholine membrane. Overall, these data give mechanistic insights into the role of cholesterol in amyloid channel formation, opening up new therapeutic options for Alzheimer's disease. Abeta22-35 peptide, which encompasses the cholesterol binding domain of Abeta, induces a specific increase of Ca(2+) level in neural cells. Double mutations V24G/K28G and N27R/K28R modify cholesterol binding and abrogate channels formation. Molecular dynamic simulations suggest that cholesterol induces a tilted alpha-helical peptide topology facilitating the formation of annular octameric channels, as schematically shown in the graphic (with a hydrogen bond shown in green for two vicinal peptides). Overall, the data give insights into the role of cholesterol in amyloid channel formation and open up new therapeutic options for Alzheimer's disease.

23919582|t|The neuroprotective activity of the amyloid precursor protein against traumatic brain injury is mediated via the heparin binding site in residues 96-110.
23919582|a|We have previously shown that following traumatic brain injury (TBI) the presence of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) may be neuroprotective. APP knockout mice have increased neuronal death and worse cognitive and motor outcomes following TBI, which is rescued by treatment with exogenous sAPPalpha (the secreted ectodomain of APP generated by alpha-secretase cleavage). Two neuroprotective regions were identified in sAPPalpha, the N and C-terminal domains D1 and D6a/E2 respectively. As both D1 and D6a/E2 contain heparin binding activity it was hypothesized that this is responsible for the neuroprotective activity. In this study, we focused on the heparin binding site, encompassed by residues 96-110 in D1, which has previously been shown to have neurotrophic properties. We found that treatment with APP96-110 rescued motor and cognitive deficits in APP-/- mice following focal TBI. APP96-110 also provided neuroprotection in Sprague-Dawley rats following diffuse TBI. Treatment with APP96-110 significantly improved functional outcome as well as preserve histological cellular morphology in APP-/- mice following focal controlled cortical impact injury. Furthermore, following administration of APP96-110 in rats after diffuse impact acceleration TBI, motor and cognitive outcomes were significantly improved and axonal injury reduced. These data define the heparin binding site in the D1 domain of sAPPalpha, represented by the sequence APP96-110, as the neuroprotective site to confer neuroprotection following TBI. The product of alpha-secretase cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein, sAPPalpha is neuroprotective following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Of interest was whether this neuroprotective activity could be further delineated to a heparin binding region within sAPPalpha, corresponding to the region APP96-110 (see diagram demonstrating the domain structure of sAPPalpha). Indeed treatment with APP96-110 improved functional outcome following TBI, an effect that was not seen with a mutated version of the peptide that had reduced heparin binding affinity.

23921613|t|Mortality rates in people dually infected with HIV-1/2 and those infected with either HIV-1 or HIV-2: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
23921613|a|OBJECTIVE: As compared to HIV-1 infection, HIV-2 is less transmissible, disease progression is slower, and the mortality risk is lower. It has been suggested that HIV-2 infection inhibits the progression of HIV-1 in individuals dually infected by HIV-1 and HIV-2 (HIV-D). We examined whether the mortality rates in dually infected individuals differ from those in persons infected with either HIV-1 or HIV-2. DESIGN: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Medline and Embase databases were searched for studies that reported the number of deaths and person-years of observation (PY) for at least two of the three HIV groups (i.e. HIV-1, HIV-2, and HIV-D). Meta-analyses were then performed with random-effects models, estimating combined mortality rate ratios (MRRs). RESULTS: Of the 631 identified titles, six articles were included in the meta-analysis of HIV-D-infected individuals versus HIV-mono-infected persons, and seven were included in the analysis of HIV-1-mono-infected versus HIV-2-mono-infected individuals. The overall MRR of those infected with HIV-D versus HIV-1 was 1.11 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95-1.30]. The overall MRR of those infected with HIV-D versus HIV-2 was 1.81 (95% CI 1.43-2.30) and the MRR of those infected with HIV-1 versus HIV-2 was 1.86 (95% CI 1.44-2.39). CONCLUSION: HIV-2-mono-infected persons have a lower mortality rate than those mono-infected with HIV-1 and those with HIV-D. There is no evidence that HIV-2 delays progression to death in HIV-D-infected individuals.

23934553|t|Up-regulation of Alzheimer's disease-associated proteins may cause enflurane anesthesia induced cognitive decline in aged rats.
23934553|a|Isoflurane anesthesia can cause post-operative cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients. As an isomer of isoflurane, enflurane may also account for cognitive dysfunction. However, the mechanism of enflurane-induced cognitive dysfunction remains obscure. In this study, we investigated the effects of enflurane anesthesia on cognitive function and the possible roles of beta-amyloid protein and phosphorylated tau protein in response to enflurane anesthesia in aged rats. After intraperitoneal injection of enflurane, the Morris water maze and the step-down passive avoidance tests were conducted to test the cognitive ability and memory. The enflurane group showed prolonged escape latency, extended space exploration time and increased number of errors at early stage after enflurane anesthesia, suggesting that enflurane should be responsible for the impairment of cognition in aged rats. In addition, we analyzed the expression level of beta-amyloid and phosphorylation level of tau in the hippocampus by immunoblotting. Interestingly, the levels of beta-amyloid and phosphorylated tau in the hippocampus increased significantly at early stage and then restored to pre-anesthetic levels. Taken together, our results suggest that increasing of beta-amyloid and phosphorylation of tau are important to cause cognitive decline in aged rats during initial stage after enflurane anesthesia.

23948922|t|Increased susceptibility to amyloid-beta toxicity in rat brain microvascular endothelial cells under hyperglycemic conditions.
23948922|a|We hypothesized that hyperglycemia-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are closely associated with amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) toxicity in endothelial cells. Brain microvascular endothelial cells from rat (RBMEC) and mice (MBMEC) were isolated from adult Sprague-Dawley rats and homozygous db/db (Leprdb/Leprdb) and heterozygous (Dock7m/Leprdb) mice, and cultured under normo- and hyperglycemic conditions for 7 d followed by 24 h exposure to Abeta1-40. Some experiments were also performed with two mitochondrial superoxide (O2 -) scavengers, MitoTempo and Peg-SOD. Cell viability was measured by the Alamar blue assay and mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) by confocal microscopy. Mitochondrial O2 - and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production was assessed by fluorescence microscopy and H2O2 production was confirmed by microplate reader. Hyperglycemia or Abeta1-40 alone did not affect cell viability in RBMEC. However, the simultaneous presence of high glucose and Abeta1-40 reduced cell viability and DeltaPsim, and enhanced mitochondrial O2 - and H2O2 production. MitoTempo and PEG-SOD prevented Abeta1-40 toxicity. Interestingly, MBMEC presented a similar pattern of alterations with db/db cultures presenting higher susceptibility to Abeta1-40. Overall, our results show that high glucose levels increase the susceptibility of brain microvascular endothelial cells to Abeta toxicity supporting the idea that hyperglycemia is a major risk factor for vascular injury associated with AD.

23948934|a|Aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau (PHF-tau), such as neurofibrillary tangles, are linked to the degree of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease. We have recently reported early clinical results of a novel PHF-tau targeting PET imaging agent, [F18]-T807. Since then, we have investigated a second novel PHF-tau targeting PET imaging agent, [F18]-T808, with different pharmacokinetic characteristics, which may be favorable for imaging Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies. Here, we describe the first human brain images with [F18]-T808.

23948938|t|Involvement of insulin-degrading enzyme in insulin- and atrial natriuretic peptide-sensitive internalization of amyloid-beta peptide in mouse brain capillary endothelial cells.
23948938|a|Cerebral clearance of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), which is implicated in Alzheimer's disease, involves elimination across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and we previously showed that an insulin-sensitive process is involved in the case of Abeta1-40. The purpose of this study was to clarify the molecular mechanism of the insulin-sensitive Abeta1-40 elimination across mouse BBB. An in vivo cerebral microinjection study demonstrated that [125I]hAbeta1-40 elimination from mouse brain was inhibited by human natriuretic peptide (hANP), and [125I]hANP elimination was inhibited by hAbeta1-40, suggesting that hAbeta1-40 and hANP share a common elimination process. Internalization of [125I]hAbeta1-40 into cultured mouse brain capillary endothelial cells (TM-BBB4) was significantly inhibited by either insulin, hANP, other natriuretic peptides or insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) inhibitors, but was not inhibited by phosphoramidon or thiorphan. Although we have reported the involvement of natriuretic peptide receptor C (Npr-C) in hANP internalization, cells stably expressing Npr-C internalized [125I]hANP but not [125I]hAbeta1-40, suggesting that there is no direct interaction between Npr-C and hAbeta1-40. IDE was detected in plasma membrane of TM-BBB4 cells, and internalization of [125I]hAbeta1-40 by TM-BBB4 cells was reduced by IDE-targeted siRNAs. We conclude that elimination of hAbeta1-40 from mouse brain across the BBB involves an insulin- and ANP-sensitive process, mediated by IDE expressed in brain capillary endothelial cells.

23948942|t|Bindarit, inhibitor of CCL2 synthesis, protects neurons against amyloid-beta-induced toxicity.
23948942|a|One of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common age-related neurodegenerative pathology, is the abnormal extracellular deposition of neurotoxic amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides that accumulate in senile plaques. Abeta aggregates are toxic to neurons and are thought to contribute to neuronal loss. Evidence indicates that inflammation is involved in the pathophysiology of AD, and activation of glial cells by a variety of factors, including Abeta, appears to be a central event. Among molecules produced during inflammation associated with neuronal death, CCL2, also known as monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), seems to be particularly important. Indeed, CCL2 levels are higher in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with AD than in controls. In the present study, we demonstrated the protective effect of bindarit (which inhibits CCL2 synthesis) against both Abeta25-35 and Abeta1-42-induced toxicity in primary mixed neural cultures. Bindarit (30-500 muM) reversed cell death induced by Abeta in a dose-dependent manner and reduced the transcription and release of CCL2 by astrocytes after Abeta treatment, as revealed by qRT-PCR, ELISA, and immunofluorescence staining. Astroglial activation and CCL2 release was induced by ATP released by damaged neurons through interaction with P2X7 receptors present on astrocyte surface. CCL2, interacting with its cognate receptor CCR2, present on neuron surface, strongly contributes to the toxic activity of Abeta. Bindarit was able to disconnect this neuro-glial interaction. Our results demonstrate the ability of bindarit to inhibit Abeta-induced neuronal death and suggest the potential role of CCL2 inhibitors in the treatment of neuroinflammatory/neurodegenerative diseases.

23954171|t|Selective benefits of simvastatin in bitransgenic APPSwe,Ind/TGF-beta1 mice.
23954171|a|Cognitive and cerebrovascular deficits are 2 landmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) to target for effective therapy. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of simvastatin in bitransgenic A/T mice overexpressing a mutated form of the human amyloid precursor protein (APP(Swe,Ind)) and a constitutively active form of transforming growth factor-beta1. These mice feature the AD amyloid beta (Abeta) and cerebrovascular pathology. Simvastatin significantly decreased insoluble Abeta peptide levels and Abeta plaque load despite no effect on beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme and Abeta-degrading enzyme neprilysin protein levels. However, simvastatin failed to improve spatial learning and memory deficits and the decreased baseline levels of the memory-related protein early growth response-1 (Egr-1) in the hippocampus CA1 area. The impaired hyperemic response to whisker stimulation in A/T mice was not improved with treatment, but simvastatin fully restored constitutive nitric oxide synthesis in vessel walls and exacerbated agonist-mediated dilatory deficits. These findings point to the efficacy of simvastatin on selective AD features in a complex model of the disease, likely reflecting the challenges faced by recent clinical trials in assessing statin efficacy.

23979025|t|Perlecan domain V inhibits amyloid-beta induced brain endothelial cell toxicity and restores angiogenic function.
23979025|a|In Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposits in the cerebrovasculature can result in neurovascular dysfunction and/or cerebral amyloid angiopathy. The accumulation of Abeta in blood vessels can cause endothelial cell damage, resulting in impaired Abeta clearance by the blood-brain barrier. Additionally, impaired endothelial cell function can result in decreased angiogenesis in the brains of AD patients, affecting cognitive function. VEGF is a crucial mediator of angiogenesis and is deficient in AD brains thus promoting angiogenesis could be an important component of successful AD treatment. The C-terminal portion of the extracellular matrix proteoglycan perlecan, Domain V (DV), promotes brain-derived endothelial cell proliferation and is proangiogenic in that it increases VEGFR2 expression and production of VEGF. In this study, we show that Abeta25-35 reduces proliferation of a mouse brain microvascular endothelial cell line (MBEC) in vitro and that DV and mouse LG3 (C-terminal fragment of DV) block these effects of Abeta25-35. Additionally, we show that DV restores the ability of MBECs to form tube-like structures on Matrigel in the presence of Abeta25-35 and that this is alpha5beta1 dependent. Interestingly, the reduction in tube-like structure formation by Abeta25-35 was not due to endothelial cell death, suggesting that Abeta25-35 induces the downregulation of a cell surface molecule required for adhesion events critical to the angiogenic process. We propose a model suggesting that DV works through both the alpha5beta1 integrin receptor and VEGFR2 to increase VEGF production, causing competition with Abeta25-35 for VEGFR2 binding, thus ultimately increasing VEGF expression and restoring angiogenesis. This supports DV as a potential anti-amyloid therapy.

23992340|t|Past and recent progress of molecular imaging probes for beta-amyloid plaques in the brain.
23992340|a|The deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques in the parenchymal and cortical brain is accepted as the main pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the Abeta deposition in the brain appears to be a good diagnostic biomarker for AD and may also be a good predictive biomarker of this disease. Molecular imaging of Abeta plaques in the brain with positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or molecular optical imaging represents a promising approach to the early diagnosis of AD and monitoring the effectiveness of novel therapies for this devastating disease. Our review focuses on the past and recent knowledge in this field with respect to small organic molecules that have been utilized for the development of Abeta imaging probes.

23993702|t|Respiratory infection promotes T cell infiltration and amyloid-beta deposition in APP/PS1 mice.
23993702|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by deposits of amyloid-beta and neurofibrillary tangles. It has been suggested that inflammatory changes are associated with disease; however, it has not been established whether these are a consequence of ongoing neurodegeneration or whether inflammation itself contributes to disease pathogenesis. Recent studies suggest that exposure to infection can accelerate cognitive decline in AD patients, and pathogens have been detected in the AD brain. However, the influence of infection on neuroinflammation and pathology remains poorly understood. In this study, we examined the effect of a peripheral infection on AD pathology in APP/PS1 mice. We found that, 8 weeks after infection with the Gram negative respiratory pathogen Bordetella pertussis, there was significant infiltration of IFNgamma- and IL-17-producing T cells and NKT cells in older APP/PS1 mice. This was accompanied by increased glial activation and amyloid-beta deposition. The data suggest that infection is a critical factor in the progression of AD, emphasising the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of infections in elderly individuals.

23996574|t|The neuroprotection of Rattin against amyloid beta peptide in spatial memory and synaptic plasticity of rats.
23996574|a|Rattin, a specific derivative of humanin in rats, shares the ability with HN to protect neurons against amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide-induced cellular toxicity. However, it is still unclear whether Rattin can protect against Abeta-induced deficits in cognition and synaptic plasticity in rats. In the present study, we observed the effects of Rattin and Abeta31-35 on the spatial reference memory and in vivo hippocampal Long-term potentiation of rats by using Morris water maze test and hippocampal field potential recording. Furthermore, the probable molecular mechanism underlying the neuroprotective roles of Rattin was investigated. We showed that intra-hippocampal injection of Rattin effectively prevented the Abeta31-35-induced spatial memory deficits and hippocampal LTP suppression in rats; the Abeta31-35-induced activation of Caspase-3 and inhibition of STAT3 in the hippocampus were also prevented by Rattin treatment. These findings indicate that Rattin treatment can protect spatial memory and synaptic plasticity of rats against Abeta31-35-induced impairments, and the underlying protective mechanism of Rattin may be involved in STAT3 and Caspases-3 pathways. Therefore, application of Rattin or activation of its signaling pathways in the brain might be beneficial to the prevention of Abeta-related cognitive deficits.

24008686|t|Modulation of amyloid-beta production by leukotriene B4 via the gamma-secretase pathway.
24008686|a|Inflammatory mechanisms have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, and among them, the pro-inflammatory 5-lipoxygenase (5LO) enzyme. While previous work has shown that 5LO modulates the amyloidotic phenotype of AD, the exact metabolic product responsible for this biological action remains unknown. In this study, we challenged neuronal cells with leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a major 5LO product, and found that it increased amyloid-beta formation whereby elevating the steady-state levels of the gamma-secretase proteins, suggesting that LTB4 is the mediator of the 5LO effect. Therapies that by blocking 5LO activation suppress the formation of LTB4 or its action represent novel AD therapeutic opportunities.

24011543|t|Association of cerebrospinal fluid Abeta42 with A2M gene in cognitively normal subjects.
24011543|a|Low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta(42) levels correlate with increased brain Abeta deposition in Alzheimer's disease (AD), which suggests a disruption in the degradation and clearance of Abeta from the brain. In addition, APOE epsilon4 carriers have lower CSF Abeta(42) levels than non-carriers. The hypothesis of this investigation was that CSF Abeta(42) levels would correlate with regulatory region variation in genes that are biologically associated with degradation or clearance of Abeta from the brain. CSF Abeta(42) levels were tested for associations with Abeta degradation and clearance genes and APOE epsilon4. Twenty-four SNPs located within the 5' and 3' regions of 12 genes were analyzed. The study sample consisted of 99 AD patients and 168 cognitively normal control subjects. CSF Abeta(42) levels were associated with APOE epsilon4 status in controls but not in AD patients; A2M regulatory region SNPs were also associated with CSF Abeta(42) levels in controls but not in AD patients, even after adjusting for APOE epsilon4. These results suggest that genetic variation within the A2M gene influences CSF Abeta(42) levels.

24012326|t|Progress update: fluid and imaging biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease.
24012326|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing health crisis around the world. Although significant progress has been made in our understanding of AD pathogenesis, there is currently no effective treatment to delay onset or prevent the disease. The focus has now shifted to the identification and treatment of AD in the early clinical stages as well as before cognitive symptoms emerge-during the long preclinical stage. It is possible that diagnosis of individuals with AD will be more accurate when clinical symptoms and signs are combined with biomarkers, which can improve both the diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of AD and its differentiation from the other neurodegenerative diseases. This review discusses fluid and imaging biomarkers that have shown promise in such areas, as well as some of the current challenges that face the field.

24021662|t|Active and passive immunization strategies based on the SDPM1 peptide demonstrate pre-clinical efficacy in the APPswePSEN1dE9 mouse model for Alzheimer's disease.
24021662|a|Recent clinical and pre-clinical studies suggest that both active and passive immunization strategies targeting Abeta amyloid may have clinical benefit in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we demonstrate that vaccination of APPswePSEN1dE9 mice with SDPM1, an engineered non-native Abeta amyloid-specific binding peptide, lowers brain Abeta amyloid plaque burden and brain Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 peptide levels, improves cognitive learning and memory in Morris water maze tests and increases the expression of synaptic brain proteins. This was the case in young mice immunized prior to development of significant brain amyloid burden, and in older mice, where brain amyloid was already present. Active immunization was optimized using ALUM as an adjuvant to stimulate production of anti-SDPM1 and anti-Abeta amyloid antibodies. Intracerebral injection of P4D6, an SDPM1 peptide-mimotope antibody, also lowered brain amyloid plaque burden in APPswePSEN1dE9 mice. Additionally, P4D6 inhibited Abeta amyloid-mediated toxicity in cultured neuronal cells. The protein sequence of the variable domain within the P4D6 heavy chain was found to mimic a multimer of the SDPM1 peptide motif. These data demonstrate the efficacy of active and passive vaccine strategies to target Abeta amyloid oligomers using an engineered peptide-mimotope strategy.

24028075|t|Comparing atomistic molecular mechanics force fields for a difficult target: a case study on the Alzheimer's amyloid beta-peptide.
24028075|a|Macromolecular function arises from structure, and many diseases are associated with misfolding of proteins. Molecular simulation methods can augment experimental techniques to understand misfolding and aggregation pathways with atomistic resolution, but the reliability of these predictions is a function of the parameters used for the simulation. There are many biomolecular force fields available, but most are validated using stably folded structures. Here, we present the results of molecular dynamics simulations on the intrinsically disordered amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta), whose misfolding and aggregation give rise to the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Because of the link between secondary structure changes and pathology, being able to accurately model the structure of Abeta would greatly improve our understanding of this disease, and it may facilitate application of modeling approaches to other protein misfolding disorders. To this end, we compared five popular atomistic force fields (AMBER03, CHARMM22 + CMAP, GROMOS96 53A6, GROMOS96 54A7, and OPLS-AA) to determine which could best model the structure of Abeta. By comparing secondary structure content, NMR shifts, and radius of gyration to available experimental data, we conclude that AMBER03 and CHARMM22 + CMAP over-stabilize helical structure within Abeta, with CHARMM22 + CMAP also producing elongated Abeta structures, in conflict with experimental findings. OPLS-AA, GROMOS96 53A6, and GROMOS96 54A7 produce very similar results in terms of helical and beta-strand content, calculated NMR shifts, and radii of gyration that agree well with experimental data.

24029643|t|Increased number of microinfarcts in Alzheimer disease at 7-T MR imaging.
24029643|a|PURPOSE: To assess the prevalence and number of cortical microinfarcts in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) by using a 7-T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging system, to assess the independent association of cortical microinfarcts with cognitive dysfunction, and to investigate potential confounding effects of the coexisting presence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The local institutional review board approved this study. In all cases, informed consent was obtained. High-spatial-resolution fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and T2*-weighted images were acquired in 14 AD patients and 18 control subjects to assess the presence of microinfarcts and microbleeds. Presence of CAA was assessed according to the Boston criteria. Image analysis was performed independently by two reviewers. Mann-Whitney U test was performed to assess differences in number of microinfarcts between groups. Negative binomial regression models were used to assess the association between diagnosis of AD and diagnosis of CAA and number of microinfarcts, between diagnosis of AD and number of microbleeds and number of microinfarcts, and between cognitive function and number of microinfarcts, all corrected for age and sex. RESULTS: Interobserver agreement was excellent for detecting microinfarcts (kappa = 0.91) (P < .001). Patients with AD demonstrated higher number (P = .005) of microinfarcts (mean, 7.2) compared with control subjects (mean, 1.8). Negative binomial regression models showed an independent association between AD and number of microinfarcts (P = .006) and a trend for CAA and microinfarcts (P = .052). A negative correlation was found between cognitive function and the number of microinfarcts (P = .009). CONCLUSION: Patients with AD show more microinfarcts than do control subjects, the number of microinfarcts correlates with global cognitive performance, and the presence of microinfarcts was mainly AD rather than CAA related.

24030360|t|Cannabinoid effects on beta amyloid fibril and aggregate formation, neuronal and microglial-activated neurotoxicity in vitro.
24030360|a|Cannabinoid (CB) ligands have demonstrated neuroprotective properties. In this study we compared the effects of a diverse set of CB ligands against beta amyloid-mediated neuronal toxicity and activated microglial-conditioned media-based neurotoxicity in vitro, and compared this with a capacity to directly alter beta amyloid (Abeta) fibril or aggregate formation. Neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells were exposed to Abeta1-42 directly or microglial (BV-2 cells) conditioned media activated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the presence of the CB1 receptor-selective agonist ACEA, CB2 receptor-selective agonist JWH-015, phytocannabinoids Delta(9)-THC and cannabidiol (CBD), the endocannabinoids 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) and anandamide or putative GPR18/GPR55 ligands O-1602 and abnormal-cannabidiol (Abn-CBD). TNF-alpha and nitrite production was measured in BV-2 cells to compare activation via LPS or albumin with Abeta1-42. Abeta1-42 evoked a concentration-dependent loss of cell viability in SH-SY5Y cells but negligible TNF-alpha and nitrite production in BV-2 cells compared to albumin or LPS. Both albumin and LPS-activated BV-2 conditioned media significantly reduced neuronal cell viability but were directly innocuous to SH-SY5Y cells. Of those CB ligands tested, only 2-AG and CBD were directly protective against Abeta-evoked SH-SY5Y cell viability, whereas JWH-015, THC, CBD, Abn-CBD and O-1602 all protected SH-SY5Y cells from BV-2 conditioned media activated via LPS. While CB ligands variably altered the morphology of Abeta fibrils and aggregates, there was no clear correlation between effects on Abeta morphology and neuroprotective actions. These findings indicate a neuroprotective action of CB ligands via actions at microglial and neuronal cells.

24036883|t|Dosage of amyloid precursor protein affects axonal contact guidance in Down syndrome.
24036883|a|Amyloid precursor protein (APP), encoded on Hsa21, functions as a cell adhesion molecule (CAM) in axonal growth cones (GCs) of the developing brain. We show here that axonal GCs of human fetal Down syndrome (DS) neurons (and of a DS mouse model) overexpress APP protein relative to euploid controls. We investigated whether DS neurons generate an abnormal, APP-dependent GC phenotype in vitro. On laminin, which binds APP and beta1 integrins (Itgb1), DS neurons formed enlarged and faster-advancing GCs compared to controls. On peptide matrices that bind APP only, but not on those binding exclusively Itgb1 or L1CAM, DS GCs were significantly enlarged (2.0-fold), formed increased close adhesions (1.8-fold), and advanced faster (1.4-fold). In assays involving alternating stripes of monospecific matrices, human control GCs exhibited no preference for any of the substrates, whereas DS GCs preferred the APP-binding matrix (cross-over decreased significantly from 48.2 to 27.2%). Reducing APP expression in DS GCs with siRNA normalized most measures of the phenotype, including substrate choice. These experiments show that human DS neurons exhibit an APP-dependent, abnormal GC phenotype characterized by increased adhesion and altered contact guidance. The results suggest that APP overexpression may perturb axonal pathfinding and circuit formation in developing DS brain.

24038346|t|Extracellular amyloid beta 42 causes necrosis, inhibition of nuclear division, and mitotic disruption under both folate deficient and folate replete conditions as measured by the cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome assay.
24038346|a|Alzheimer's disease is associated with accumulation of extracellular beta amyloid peptide 42 (Abeta42) which may induce DNA damage and reduce cellular regenerative potential. These effects may be exacerbated under conditions of folate deficiency. The aim of this study was to investigate whether extracellular Abeta42 induces DNA damage and cell death in human peripheral lymphocytes and whether there is an interactive effect between extracellular Abeta42 and folic acid status. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were cultured in medium under conditions of both low and high folate (20 and 200 nM, respectively) and challenged with either Abeta42 or the physiologically normal form Abeta40 (both at 5, 10, 15 microM). Genome stability and cytotoxicity events were investigated using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome (CBMN-cyt) assay. Outcome measures scored included the nuclear division index (NDI), necrosis, apoptosis, binucleated cells with micronuclei (MN), nucleoplasmic bridges (NPB), and nuclear buds (NBUD) and abnormally shaped nuclei (circular, (CIR) and horse-shoe, (HS) that may be indicative of mitotic disruption. Folic acid deficiency significantly reduced NDI (P < 0.001) and increased all the DNA damage biomarkers (MN, NPB, NBUD, HS, CIR), (P < 0.001). In contrast, exposure to Abeta40 had no impact on CBMN cytome biomarkers but Abeta42 significantly reduced NDI (P < 0.01), increased necrosis (P < 0.05) and frequency of cells with circular nuclei (P < 0.01). There was no evidence of an interaction between Abeta42 and folic acid with respect to CBMN cytome biomarkers. Extracellular Abeta42 appears to have cytotoxic and cytostatic effects but its effect on chromosomal instability appears to be small relative to folate deficiency.

24040810|t|Pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease: role of oxidative stress, amyloid-beta peptides, systemic ammonia and erythrocyte energy metabolism.
24040810|a|Abeta exerts prooxidant or antioxidant effects based on the metal ion concentrations that it sequesters from the cytosol; at low metal ion concentrations, it is an antioxidant, whereas at relatively higher concentration it is a prooxidant. Thus Alzheimer disease (AD) treatment strategies based solely on the amyloid-beta clearance should be re-examined in light of the vast accumulating evidence that increased oxidative stress in the human brains is the key causative factor for AD. Accumulating evidence indicates that the reduced brain glucose availability and brain hypoxia, due to the relatively lower concentration of ATP and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, may be associated with increased concentration of endogenous ammonia, a potential neurotoxin in the AD brains. In this review, we summarize the progress in this area, and present some of our ongoing research activities with regard to brain Amyloid-beta, systemic ammonia, erythrocyte energy metabolism and the role of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate in AD pathogenesis.

Amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta), a cleavage product of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), exerts detrimental effects on synapses, a process thought to be causally related to the cognitive deficits in AD. Here, we used in vivo two-photon microscopy to characterize the dynamics of axonal boutons and dendritic spines in APP/Presenilin 1 (APP(swe)/PS1(L166P))-green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic mice. Time-lapse imaging over 4 weeks revealed a pronounced, concerted instability of pre- and postsynaptic structures within the vicinity of amyloid plaques. Treatment with a novel sulfonamide-type gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI) attenuated the formation and growth of new plaques and, most importantly, led to a normalization of the enhanced dynamics of synaptic structures close to plaques. GSI treatment did neither affect spines and boutons distant from plaques in amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1-GFP (APPPS1-GFP) nor those in GFP-control mice, suggesting no obvious neuropathological side effects of the drug.

24064186|t|miR128 up-regulation correlates with impaired amyloid beta(1-42) degradation in monocytes from patients with sporadic Alzheimer's disease.
24064186|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia in elderly individuals, is characterized by neurofibrillary tangles, extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and neuroinflammation. New evidence has shown that the lysosomal system might be a crossroad in which etiological factors in AD pathogenesis converge. This study shows that several lysosomal enzymes, including Cathepsin B, D, S, beta-Galactosidase, alpha-Mannosidase, and beta-Hexosaminidase, were less expressed in monocytes and lymphocytes from patients with a clinical diagnosis of AD dementia compared with cells from healthy controls. In vitro experiments of gain and loss of function suggest that down-regulation is a direct consequence of miR-128 up-regulation found in AD-related cells. The present study also demonstrates that miR-128 inhibition in monocytes from AD patients improves Abeta(1-42) degradation. These results could contribute to clarify the molecular mechanisms that affect the imbalanced Abeta production/clearance involved in the pathogenesis of AD.

24067533|t|Functional screening in Drosophila identifies Alzheimer's disease susceptibility genes and implicates Tau-mediated mechanisms.
24067533|a|Using a Drosophila model of Alzheimer's disease (AD), we systematically evaluated 67 candidate genes based on AD-associated genomic loci (P < 10(-4)) from published human genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Genetic manipulation of 87 homologous fly genes was tested for modulation of neurotoxicity caused by human Tau, which forms neurofibrillary tangle pathology in AD. RNA interference (RNAi) targeting 9 genes enhanced Tau neurotoxicity, and in most cases reciprocal activation of gene expression suppressed Tau toxicity. Our screen implicates cindr, the fly ortholog of the human CD2AP AD susceptibility gene, as a modulator of Tau-mediated disease mechanisms. Importantly, we also identify the fly orthologs of FERMT2 and CELF1 as Tau modifiers, and these loci have been independently validated as AD susceptibility loci in the latest GWAS meta-analysis. Both CD2AP and FERMT2 have been previously implicated with roles in cell adhesion, and our screen additionally identifies a fly homolog of the human integrin adhesion receptors, ITGAM and ITGA9, as a modifier of Tau neurotoxicity. Our results highlight cell adhesion pathways as important in Tau toxicity and AD susceptibility and demonstrate the power of model organism genetic screens for the functional follow-up of human GWAS.

24067928|t|Improvement of spatial memory function in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice after chronic inhibition of phosphodiesterase type 4D.
24067928|a|Phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitors (PDE4-Is) have received increasing attention as cognition-enhancers and putative treatment strategies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). By preventing cAMP breakdown, PDE4-Is can enhance intracellular signal transduction and increase the phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and transcription of proteins related to synaptic plasticity and associated memory formation. Unfortunately, clinical development of PDE4-Is has been seriously hampered by emetic side effects. The new isoform-specific PDE4D-I, GEBR-7b, has shown to have beneficial effects on memory at non-emetic doses. The aim of the current study was to investigate chronic cognition-enhancing effects of GEBR-7b in a mouse model of AD. To this extent, 5-month-old (5M) APPswe/PS1dE9 mice received daily subcutaneous injections with GEBR-7b (0.001 mg/kg) or vehicle for a period of 3 weeks, and were tested on affective and cognitive behavior at 7M. We demonstrated a cognition-enhancing potential in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice as their spatial memory function at 7M in the object location test was improved by prior GEBR-7b treatment. APPswe/PS1dE9 mice displayed lower levels of CREB phosphorylation, which remained unaltered after chronic GEBR-7b treatment, and higher levels of tau in the hippocampus. Hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels and synaptic densities were not different between experimental groups and no effects were observed on hippocampal GSK3beta and tau phosphorylation or Abeta levels. In conclusion, GEBR-7b can enhance spatial memory function in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse model of AD. Although the underlying mechanisms of its cognition-enhancing potential remain to be elucidated, PDE4D inhibition appears an interesting novel therapeutic option for cognitive deficits in AD.

24071439|t|The Alzheimer's disease mitochondrial cascade hypothesis: progress and perspectives.
24071439|a|Ten years ago we first proposed the Alzheimer's disease (AD) mitochondrial cascade hypothesis. This hypothesis maintains that gene inheritance defines an individual's baseline mitochondrial function; inherited and environmental factors determine rates at which mitochondrial function changes over time; and baseline mitochondrial function and mitochondrial change rates influence AD chronology. Our hypothesis unequivocally states in sporadic, late-onset AD, mitochondrial function affects amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression, APP processing, or beta amyloid (Abeta) accumulation and argues if an amyloid cascade truly exists, mitochondrial function triggers it. We now review the state of the mitochondrial cascade hypothesis, and discuss it in the context of recent AD biomarker studies, diagnostic criteria, and clinical trials. Our hypothesis predicts that biomarker changes reflect brain aging, new AD definitions clinically stage brain aging, and removing brain Abeta at any point will marginally impact cognitive trajectories. Our hypothesis, therefore, offers unique perspective into what sporadic, late-onset AD is and how to best treat it.

24071813|t|FLZ inhibited gamma-secretase selectively and decreased Abeta mitochondrial production in APP-SH-SY5Y cells.
24071813|a|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism is a key factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid-beta (Abeta) in mitochondria comes from APP mitochondrial metabolism or from the uptake Abeta from outside of mitochondria. It has been recently proposed that mitochondria are involved in the biochemical pathways through which Abeta causes neuronal dysfunction. The accumulated Abeta in mitochondria decreases the level of cytochrome c oxidase (COX IV) and attenuates the ATP production consequently. FLZ is a synthetic cyclic derivative of squamosamide from Annona glabra. In this study, the effect of FLZ on APP processing in mitochondria was investigated in SH-SY5Y cells over-expressing APP695 (wt/Swe). FLZ treatment attenuated APP processing and decreased Abeta production in mitochondria. The mitochondrial function was increased with the upregulation of COX IV both at protein and activity levels. ATP production was also increased after FLZ treatment. The mechanistic study showed that FLZ inhibited gamma-secretase activity by decreasing C-terminal fragment protein level of presenilin, the active center of gamma-secretase. The effect of FLZ differs from DAPT (a non-selective gamma-secretase inhibitor), suggesting FLZ is a selective gamma-secretase inhibitor. FLZ selectively inhibited gamma-secretase in the cleavage of recombinant C terminus of APP in vitro, without specifically modulating the processing of recombinant Notch intracellular domain. These results indicate that FLZ decreases Abeta accumulation in mitochondria by selectively inhibiting gamma-secretase. We propose that FLZ is a potential anti-AD drug candidate, and its mechanism may be improving mitochondrial function by reducing the Abeta burden in mitochondria.

24072071|t|Increased efflux of amyloid-beta peptides through the blood-brain barrier by muscarinic acetylcholine receptor inhibition reduces pathological phenotypes in mouse models of brain amyloidosis.
24072071|a|The formation and accumulation of toxic amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) in the brain may drive the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Accordingly, disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease and related disorders could result from treatments regulating Abeta homeostasis. Examples are the inhibition of production, misfolding, and accumulation of Abeta or the enhancement of its clearance. Here we show that oral treatment with ACI-91 (Pirenzepine) dose-dependently reduced brain Abeta burden in AbetaPPPS1, hAbetaPPSL, and AbetaPP/PS1 transgenic mice. A possible mechanism of action of ACI-91 may occur through selective inhibition of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (AChR) on endothelial cells of brain microvessels and enhanced Abeta peptide clearance across the blood-brain barrier. One month treatment with ACI-91 increased the clearance of intrathecally-injected Abeta in plaque-bearing mice. ACI-91 also accelerated the clearance of brain-injected Abeta in blood and peripheral tissues by favoring its urinal excretion. A single oral dose of ACI-91 reduced the half-life of interstitial Abeta peptide in pre-plaque mhAbetaPP/PS1d mice. By extending our studies to an in vitro model, we showed that muscarinic AChR inhibition by ACI-91 and Darifenacin augmented the capacity of differentiated endothelial monolayers for active transport of Abeta peptide. Finally, ACI-91 was found to consistently affect, in vitro and in vivo, the expression of endothelial cell genes involved in Abeta transport across the Blood Brain Brain (BBB). Thus increased Abeta clearance through the BBB may contribute to reduced Abeta burden and associated phenotypes. Inhibition of muscarinic AChR restricted to the periphery may present a therapeutic advantage as it avoids adverse central cholinergic effects.

24072481|t|Amyloid beta suppresses protein C activation through inhibition of the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR).
24072481|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known to be associated with microcirculatory injury, capillary blockage, and disruption of the blood-brain barrier. Endothelial dysfunction has also been reported to be associated with AD, but the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) is an N-glycosylated type I membrane protein that enhances the activation of protein C. However, the effects of EPCR and protein C in AD are still unknown. In this study, we found that the expression of EPCR was reduced in the brains of beta-amyloid precursor protein overexpressing Tg2576 transgenic mice at both the mRNA level and the protein level. However, levels of thrombomodulin (TM) did not undergo any changes. An in vitro study displayed that beta-amyloid (Abeta) treatment led to suppression of EPCR along with reduction of protein C activation in mouse primary endothelial cells. Further study revealed that the induction of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-Jun pathway plays a causal role in the inhibitory effects of Abeta1-42 on the expression of EPCR. As a transcriptional factor, c-Jun was able to transinactivate the EPCR promoter. Finally, we found that c-Jun silencing or the use of a JNK inhibitor could attenuate the effects of Abeta1-42 in the activation of protein C.

24077017|t|Altered levels of amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain-interacting proteins in Alzheimer disease.
24077017|a|BACKGROUND: The amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain (AICD) is an intrinsically unstructured molecule with functional promiscuity that plays an important role in determining the fate of the neurons during its degeneration. Its association with Alzheimer disease (AD) recently played a key role in propelling scientists to choose AICD as a major molecule of interest. Although several studies have been conducted elucidating AICD's participation in inducing neurodegenerative outcomes in AD condition, much remains to be deciphered regarding the linkage of AICD with cellular pathways in the AD scenario. RESULTS: In the present study, we have pulled down interactors of nonphosphorylated AICD from the cerebrospinal fluid of AD subjects, identified them by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry, and subsequently studied the differential expression of these interactors in AD and control cases by 2-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis. The study has yielded some AICD-interactors that are differentially expressed in the AD cases and are involved in diverse cellular functions. CONCLUSIONS: This proteomic-based approach highlights the first step in finding the possible cellular pathways engaged in AD pathophysiology on the basis of interaction of one or more of their members with AICD.

24081304|t|STAT1 negatively regulates spatial memory formation and mediates the memory-impairing effect of Abeta.
24081304|a|Signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1) has an important role in inflammation and the innate immune response, but its role in the central nervous system is less well understood. Here, we examined the role of STAT1 in spatial learning and memory, and assessed the involvement of STAT1 in mediating the memory-impairing effect of amyloid-beta (Abeta). We found that water maze training downregulated STAT1 expression in the rat hippocampal CA1 area, and spatial learning and memory function was enhanced in Stat1-knockout mice. Conversely, overexpression of STAT1 impaired water maze performance. STAT1 strongly upregulated the expression of the extracellular matrix protein laminin beta1 (LB1), which also impaired water maze performance in rats. Furthermore, Abeta impaired spatial learning and memory in association with a dose-dependent increase in STAT1 and LB1 expression, but knockdown of STAT1 and LB1 both reversed this effect of Abeta. This Abeta-induced increase in STAT1 and LB1 expression was also associated with a decrease in the expression of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunits, NR1, and NR2B. Overexpression of NR1 or NR2B or exogenous application of NMDA reversed Abeta-induced learning and memory deficits as well as Abeta-induced STAT1 and LB1 expression. Our results demonstrate that STAT1 negatively regulates spatial learning and memory through transcriptional regulation of LB1 expression. We also identified a novel mechanism for Abeta pathogenesis through STAT1 induction. Notably, impairment of spatial learning and memory by this STAT1-mediated mechanism is independent of cAMP responsive element-binding protein signaling.

24094580|t|beta-amyloid impairs the regulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors by glycogen synthase kinase 3.
24094580|a|Accumulating evidence suggests that glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) is a multifunctional kinase implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the synaptic actions of GSK-3 in AD conditions are largely unknown. In this study, we examined the impact of GSK-3 on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) channels, the major mediator of synaptic plasticity. Application of GSK-3 inhibitors or knockdown of GSK-3 caused a significant reduction of NMDAR-mediated ionic and synaptic current in cortical neurons, whereas this effect of GSK-3 was impaired in cortical neurons treated with beta-amyloid (Abeta) or from transgenic mice overexpressing mutant amyloid precursor protein. GSK-3 activity was elevated by Abeta, and GSK-3 inhibitors failed to decrease the surface expression of NMDA receptor NR1 (NR1) and NR1/postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) interaction in amyloid precursor protein mice, which was associated with the diminished GSK-3 regulation of Rab5 activity that mediates NMDAR internalization. Consequently, GSK-3 inhibitor lost the capability of protecting neurons against N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced excitotoxicity in Abeta-treated neurons. These results have provided a novel mechanism underlying the involvement of GSK-3 in AD.

24100123|t|Growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 promotes autophagic removal of amyloid-beta protein precursor intracellular domain overload in neuronal cells.
24100123|a|The ascertainment of elevated levels of amyloid-beta protein precursor intracellular domain (AICD) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains and the fact that it contributes to AD-like pathology has geared the search toward a new paradigm. While studying endogenous as well as overexpressed Grb2-AICD interaction in AD cell models, it was found that Grb2 co-localized to compartments along with AICD. We report now that these vesicles form in a clathrin and dynamin independent manner. Both types of vesicles mature into autophagosomes, merge with lysosomes, and relieve the cells of AICD overload. Inhibiting autophagosome formation results in vesicle accumulation. AICD-level is reduced in Grb2 excess condition in Cycloheximide Chase setup. Reduced caspase activity and apoptosis point toward the fact that the cytotoxic effect of AICD is alleviated by its sequestration in autolysosomes. Hence we state that the entrapping of AICD in Grb2 vesicles and its clearance via autophagosomes is a survival contrivance on the part of the cell. This study unravels, for the first time, the roles of Grb2 in autophagy and in handling toxic protein overload in an AD-like scenario.

24101600|t|Differential, dominant activation and inhibition of Notch signalling and APP cleavage by truncations of PSEN1 in human disease.
24101600|a|PRESENILIN1 (PSEN1) is the major locus for mutations causing familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) and is also mutated in Pick disease of brain, familial acne inversa and dilated cardiomyopathy. It is a critical facilitator of Notch signalling and many other signalling pathways and protein cleavage events including production of the Amyloidbeta (Abeta) peptide from the AMYLOID BETA A4 PRECURSOR PROTEIN (APP). We previously reported that interference with splicing of transcripts of the zebrafish orthologue of PSEN1 creates dominant negative effects on Notch signalling. Here, we extend this work to show that various truncations of human PSEN1 (or zebrafish Psen1) protein have starkly differential effects on Notch signalling and cleavage of zebrafish Appa (a paralogue of human APP). Different truncations can suppress or stimulate Notch signalling but not Appa cleavage and vice versa. The G183V mutation possibly causing Pick disease causes production of aberrant transcripts truncating the open reading frame after exon 5 sequence. We show that the truncated protein potentially translated from these transcripts avidly incorporates into very stable Psen1-dependent higher molecular weight complexes and suppresses cleavage of Appa but not Notch signalling. In contrast, the truncated protein potentially produced by the P242LfsX11 acne inversa mutation has no effect on Appa cleavage but, unexpectedly, enhances Notch signalling. Our results suggest novel hypotheses for the pathological mechanisms underlying these diseases and illustrate the importance of investigating the function of dominant mutations at physiologically relevant expression levels and in the normally heterozygous state in which they cause human disease rather than in isolation from healthy alleles.

24101602|t|Altered CpG methylation in sporadic Alzheimer's disease is associated with APP and MAPT dysregulation.
24101602|a|The hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is an accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) and phosphorylated tau, which are encoded by the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) genes, respectively. Less than 5% of all AD cases are familial in nature, i.e. caused by mutations in APP, PSEN1 or PSEN2. Almost all mutations found in them are related to an overproduction of Abeta1-42, which is prone to aggregation. While these genes are mutation free, their function, or those of related genes, could be compromised in sporadic AD as well. In this study, pyrosequencing analysis of post-mortem brains revealed aberrant CpG methylation in APP, MAPT and GSK3B genes of the AD brain. These changes were further evaluated by a newly developed in vitro-specific DNA methylation system, which in turn highlighted an enhanced expression of APP and MAPT. Cell nucleus sorting of post-mortem brains revealed that the methylation changes of APP and MAPT occurred in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells, whereas GSK3B was abnormally methylated in non-neuronal cells. Further analysis revealed an association between abnormal APP CpG methylation and apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele (APOE epsilon4)-negative cases. The presence of a small number of highly methylated neurons among normal neurons contribute to the methylation difference in APP and MAPT CpGs, thus abnormally methylated cells could compromise the neural circuit and/or serve as 'seed cells' for abnormal protein propagation. Our results provide a link between familial AD genes and sporadic neuropathology, thus emphasizing an epigenetic pathomechanism for sporadic AD.

24102330|t|A novel function for proSAAS as an amyloid anti-aggregant in Alzheimer's disease.
24102330|a|Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) are characterized by an abnormal aggregation of misfolded beta-sheet rich proteins such as beta-amyloid (Abeta). Various ubiquitously expressed molecular chaperones control the correct folding of cellular proteins and prevent the accumulation of harmful species. We here describe a novel anti-aggregant chaperone function for the neuroendocrine protein proSAAS, an abundant secretory polypeptide that is widely expressed within neural and endocrine tissues and which has previously been associated with neurodegenerative disease in various proteomics studies. In the brains of 12-month-old APdE9 mice, and in the cortex of a human AD-affected brain, proSAAS immunoreactivity was highly colocalized with amyloid pathology. Immunoreactive proSAAS co-immunoprecipitated with Abeta immunoreactivity in lysates from APdE9 mouse brains. In vitro, proSAAS efficiently prevented the fibrillation of Abeta(1-42) at molar ratios of 1 : 10, and this anti-aggregation effect was dose dependent. Structure-function studies showed that residues 97-180 were sufficient for the anti-aggregation function against Abeta. Finally, inclusion of recombinant proSAAS in the medium of Neuro2a cells, as well as lentiviral-mediated proSAAS over-expression, blocked the neurocytotoxic effect of Abeta(1-42) in Neuro2a cells. Taken together, our results suggest that proSAAS may play a role in Alzheimer's disease pathology.

24112789|t|Nature of the neurotoxic membrane actions of amyloid-beta on hippocampal neurons in Alzheimer's disease.
24112789|a|The mechanism by which amyloid-beta (Abeta) produces brain dysfunction in patients with Alzheimer's disease is largely unknown. According to previous studies, Abeta might share perforating properties with gramicidin, a well-accepted membrane-disrupting peptide. Therefore, we hypothesize that the key steps leading to synaptotoxicity by Abeta and gramicidin involve peptide aggregation, pore formation, and calcium dysregulation. Here, we show that Abeta and gramicidin form aggregates enriched in beta-sheet structures using electron microscopy, and Thioflavin and Congo Red staining techniques. Also, we found that Abeta and gramicidin display fairly similar actions in hippocampal cell membranes, i.e. inducing Ca(2+) entry and synaptoxicity characterized by the loss of synaptic proteins and a decrease in neuronal viability. These effects were not observed in a Ca(2+) free solution, indicating that both Abeta and gramicidin induce neurotoxicity by a Ca(2+)-dependent mechanism. Using combined perforated patch clamp and imaging recordings, we found that only Abeta produced a perforation that progressed from a small (Cl(-)-selective pore) to a larger perforation that allowed the entry of fluorescent molecules. Therefore, based on these results, we propose that the perforation at the plasma membrane by Abeta is a dynamic process that is critical in producing neurotoxicity similar to that found in the brains of AD patients.

24112791|t|Effects of the neurotrophic agent T-817MA on oligomeric amyloid-beta-induced deficits in long-term potentiation in the hippocampal CA1 subfield.
24112791|a|Formation of oligomeric amyloid-beta (oAbeta) is 1 of the most likely causes of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We hypothesized that in the early phase of AD, cognitive impairments observed before marked neuronal loss and brain atrophy might be associated with oAbeta-induced synaptic dysfunction. T-817MA [1-{3-[2-(1-benzothiophen-5-yl)ethoxy]propyl}azetidin-3-ol maleate] has both neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects and is used to treat AD. Although T-817MA has been shown to ameliorate amyloid-induced learning deficits in experimental AD models, it remains unclear whether this drug would be able to prevent oAbeta-induced synaptotoxicity. In the present study, we investigated the effects of T-817MA on the disturbances in synaptic plasticity induced by oAbeta42 and oligomeric photo-cross-linked Abeta42 (oXLAbeta42) in a slice preparation of the CA1 subfield of mouse hippocampus. Both oAbeta42 and oXLAbeta42 treatments significantly reduced the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP). In addition, oAbeta42 treatment significantly facilitated long-term depression (LTD). Treatment with T-817MA ameliorated the LTP reduction; however, T-817MA treatment did not inhibit the facilitation of LTD induction by oAbeta42. These results suggest that T-817MA reverses oAbeta-induced LTP reduction as it may occur in the early phase of AD.

24117759|t|Blocking the apolipoprotein E/amyloid beta interaction in triple transgenic mice ameliorates Alzheimer's disease related amyloid beta and tau pathology.
24117759|a|Inheritance of the apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4) genotype has been identified as the major genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies have shown that the binding between apoE and amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides occurs at residues 244-272 of apoE and residues 12-28 of Abeta. ApoE4 has been implicated in promoting Abeta deposition and impairing clearance of Abeta. We hypothesized that blocking the apoE/Abeta interaction would serve as an effective new approach to AD therapy. We have previously shown that treatment with Abeta12-28P can reduce amyloid plaques in APP/PS1 transgenic (Tg) mice and vascular amyloid in TgSwDI mice with congophilic amyloid angiopathy. In the present study, we investigated whether the Abeta12-28P elicits a therapeutic effect on tau-related pathology in addition to amyloid pathology using old triple transgenic AD mice (3xTg, with PS1M146V , APPSwe and tauP30IL transgenes) with established pathology from the ages of 21 to 26 months. We show that treatment with Abeta12-28P substantially reduces tau pathology both immunohistochemically and biochemically, as well as reducing the amyloid burden and suppressing the activation of astrocytes and microglia. These affects correlate with a behavioral amelioration in the treated Tg mice.

24119373|t|Effect of Curcumin on the metal ion induced fibrillization of amyloid-beta peptide.
24119373|a|The effect of Curcumin on Cu(II) and Zn(II) induced oligomerization and protofibrillization of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide has been studied by spectroscopic and microscopic methods. Curcumin could significantly reduce the beta-sheet content of the peptide in a time dependent manner. It also plays an antagonistic role in beta-sheet formation that is promoted by metal ions like Cu(II) and Zn(II) as observed by Circular Dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Atomic force microscopic (AFM) images show that spontaneous fibrillization of the peptide occurs in presence of Cu(II) and Zn(II) but is inhibited on incubation of the peptide with Curcumin indicating the beneficial role of Curcumin in preventing the aggregation of Abeta peptide.

24120836|t|Abeta, oxidative stress in Alzheimer disease: evidence based on proteomics studies.
24120836|a|The initiation and progression of Alzheimer disease (AD) is a complex process not yet fully understood. While many hypotheses have been provided as to the cause of the disease, the exact mechanisms remain elusive and difficult to verify. Proteomic applications in disease models of AD have provided valuable insights into the molecular basis of this disorder, demonstrating that on a protein level, disease progression impacts numerous cellular processes such as energy production, cellular structure, signal transduction, synaptic function, mitochondrial function, cell cycle progression, and proteasome function. Each of these cellular functions contributes to the overall health of the cell, and the dysregulation of one or more could contribute to the pathology and clinical presentation in AD. In this review, foci reside primarily on the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) induced oxidative stress hypothesis and the proteomic studies that have been conducted by our laboratory and others that contribute to the overall understanding of this devastating neurodegenerative disease.

24121966|t|Candidate blood proteome markers of Alzheimer's disease onset and progression: a systematic review and replication study.
24121966|a|A blood-based protein biomarker, or set of protein biomarkers, that could predict onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) would have great utility; potentially clinically, but also for clinical trials and especially in the selection of subjects for preventative trials. We reviewed a comprehensive list of 21 published discovery or panel-based (> 100 proteins) blood proteomics studies of AD, which had identified a total of 163 candidate biomarkers. Few putative blood-based protein biomarkers replicate in independent studies but we found that some proteins do appear in multiple studies; for example, four candidate biomarkers are found to associate with AD-related phenotypes in five independent research cohorts in these 21 studies: alpha-1-antitrypsin, alpha-2-macroglobulin, apolipoprotein E, and complement C3. Using SomaLogic's SOMAscan proteomics technology, we were able to conduct a large-scale replication study for 94 of the 163 candidate biomarkers from these 21 published studies in plasma samples from 677 subjects from the AddNeuroMed (ANM) and the Alzheimer's Research UK/Maudsley BRC Dementia Case Registry at King's Health Partners (ARUK/DCR) research cohorts. Nine of the 94 previously reported candidates were found to associate with AD-related phenotypes (False Discovery Rate (FDR) q-value < 0.1). These proteins show sufficient replication to be considered for further investigation as a biomarker set. Overall, we show that there are some signs of a replicable signal in the range of proteins identified in previous studies and we are able to further replicate some of these. This suggests that AD pathology does affect the blood proteome with some consistency.

24126157|t|Brainwide distribution and variance of amyloid-beta deposits in tg-ArcSwe mice.
24126157|a|Transgenic mice carrying the Arctic (E693G) and Swedish (KM670/6701NL) amyloid-beta precursor protein (AbetaPP) develop amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposits in the brain that resemble Alzheimer's disease neuropathology. Earlier studies of this model have documented morphologic features in selected parts of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, but the spatial distribution within the brain and variance of Abeta deposits within a group of tg-ArcSwe mice is unknown. Using immunohistochemistry and brainwide microscopic analysis of 12-month-old tg-ArcSwe mice, we show that Abetax-40 plaque deposits are consistently present in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus and variably present in other regions. Using quantitative image analysis, we demonstrated that the average Abeta burden in the cortex and hippocampus is similar across animals, with coefficients of variance of 22% and 25%, respectively. This indicates that interventional studies of tg-ArcSwe mice are feasible using region-of-interest comparisons and that interventional trials require larger group sizes than commonly used. We also present an online atlas providing access to images showing the detailed characteristics and spatial distribution patterns of Abetax-40 labeling.

24126161|t|Absence of A673T variant in APP gene indicates an alternative protective mechanism contributing to longevity in Chinese individuals.
24126161|a|A673T, a rare variant in the amyloid-beta precursor protein gene, shows a protective potential against Alzheimer's disease (AD) and age-related cognitive decline in an Icelandic population. Although A673T was observed independently in a Finnish population, this variant was absent in 8721 Asian subjects. The conflicting observations suggest that the contribution of A673T may be confined to Europeans and Americans rather than Asians. Nevertheless, A673T confers a protective function against AD and thus may be observed only in longevity subjects; thus it is not surprising to see its absence when the general populations or the patient cohorts were considered. To test whether the A673T contributes to the Chinese population, 1237 healthy longevity subjects (mean age 96.9 years) and 1404 matched younger controls (mean age 44.2 years) were genotyped for the variant. Our study failed to observe this variant in either the longevity subjects or the controls. Given the previous observation from Asians, our results suggest that the A673T variant is not involved in longevity in Chinese individuals; some other protective mechanisms may contribute to a lower incidence of AD in Chinese nonagenerians and centenarians.

24126163|a|The progressive deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the brain is a pathologic feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study was aimed to determine whether endogenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) modulates the pathogenic process of AD. tPA expression and activity developed around amyloid plaques in the brains of human amyloid precursor protein-overexpressing Tg2576 mice, which were weakened by the genetic ablation of tPA. Although the complete loss of tPA was developmentally fatal to Tg2576 mice, tPA-heterozygous Tg2576 mice expressed the more severe degenerative phenotypes than tPA wild-type Tg2576 mice, including abnormal and unhealthy growth, shorter life spans, significantly enhanced Abeta levels, and the deposition of more and larger amyloid plaques in the brain. In addition, the expression of synaptic function-associated proteins was significantly reduced, which in turn caused a more severe impairment in learning and memory performance in Tg2576 mice. Thus, endogenous tPA, preferentially its aggregate form, could degrade Abeta molecules and maintain low levels of brain Abeta, resulting in the delay of AD pathogenesis.

24128919|t|Effect of substituent of terpyridines on the in vitro antioxidant, antitubercular, biocidal and fluorescence studies of copper(II) complexes with clioquinol.
24128919|a|An octahedral complexes of copper with clioquinol(CQ) and substituted terpyridine have been synthesized. The Cu(II) complexes have been characterized by elemental analyses, thermogravimetric analyses, magnetic moment measurements, FT-IR, electronic, (1)HNMR and FAB mass spectra. Antimycobacterial screening of ligand and its copper compound against Mycobacterium tuberculosis shows clear enhancement in the antitubercular activity upon copper complexation. Ferric-reducing anti-oxidant power of all complexes were measured. The fluorescence spectra of complexes show red shift, which may be due to the chelation by the ligands to the metal ion. It enhances ligand ability to accept electrons and decreases the electron transition energy. The antimicrobial efficiency of the complexes were tested on five different microorganisms and showed good biological activity.

24144550|t|Bizarre behaviors and risk assessment in 3xTg-AD mice at early stages of the disease.
24144550|a|Bizarre behaviors (stereotyped stretching, stereotyped rearing, backward movements and jumps) were conspicuously elicited in classical unconditioned tests with different levels of anxiogenic conditions. They were characterized for the first time as early-BPSD-like symptoms in 6 month-old male and female 3xTg-AD mice. The pattern of these behaviors differed from that exhibited by their age- and gender-matched NTg counterparts. Confrontation of an open and illuminated field was the best trigger of such behaviors as compared to mild neophobia in the corner test or the choice between two compartments in the dark-light box. Here we also report that increased freezing, delayed thigmotaxis and enhancement of emotional behaviors were early BPSD-like symptoms indicative of their response to low-stressful environments. Independently of the genotype, consistent gender effects pointed toward the relevance of female gender to study bizarre behaviors and risk assessment. The identification of items of behavior and its gender component were relevant to find out bidirectional and selective behavioral long-lasting effects of postnatal handling. This early life treatment reduced freezing and most of the bizarre behaviors whereas potentiated risk assessment and the horizontal locomotor activity. In contrast, vertical exploratory activity was not modified by the treatment. The results also talk in favor of the beneficence of early-life interventions on the behavioral outcome in adulthood in both healthy and disease conditions. As shown, the consideration of bizarre behaviors and risk assessment may become an additional tool for evaluating BPSD-like symptoms in relation to preventive and/or therapeutical strategies targeted at AD. It may also have a role in the evaluation of the potential risk factors for the disease.

24150104|t|Rosiglitazone prevents amyloid-beta oligomer-induced impairment of synapse formation and plasticity via increasing dendrite and spine mitochondrial number.
24150104|a|Rosiglitazone has been known to attenuate neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. In this study, living-cell image, immunocytochemistry, and electrophysiology were used to examine the effects of soluble amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) oligomers and rosiglitazone on the synapse formation, plasticity, and mitochondrial distribution in cultured neurons. Incubation of hippocampal cultures with amyloid-beta (Abeta)42 oligomers (0.5 muM) for 3 h significantly decreased dendritic filopodium and synapse density. Pretreatment with rosiglitazone (0.5-5 muM) for 24 h prevented the Abeta42-induced loss of dendritic filopodium and synapse in a dose-dependent manner. However, neither Abeta42 oligomer nor rosiglitazone has a significant effect on the velocity and length of dendritic filopodia. Electrophysiological recording showed that acute exposure of slices with 0.5 muM Abeta42 oligomers impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). Pre-incubation of hippocampal slices with rosiglitazone significantly attenuated the Abeta42-induced LTP deficit, which depended on rosiglitazone concentrations (1-5 muM) and pretreatment period (1-5 h). The beneficial effects of rosiglitazone were abolished by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) specific antagonist, GW9662. Moreover, the mitochondrial numbers in the dendrite and spine were decreased by Abeta42 oligomers, which can be prevented by rosiglitazone. In conclusion, our data suggested that rosiglitazone prevents Abeta42 oligomers-induced impairment via increasing mitochondrial numbers in the dendrite and spine, improving synapse formation and plasticity. This process is most likely through the PPARgamma-dependent pathway and in concentration and time dependent manners. The study provides novel insights into the mechanisms for the protective effects of rosiglitzone on AD.

24150106|t|Coconut oil attenuates the effects of amyloid-beta on cortical neurons in vitro.
24150106|a|Dietary supplementation has been studied as an approach to ameliorating deficits associated with aging and neurodegeneration. We undertook this pilot study to investigate the effects of coconut oil supplementation directly on cortical neurons treated with amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide in vitro. Our results indicate that neuron survival in cultures co-treated with coconut oil and Abeta is rescued compared to cultures exposed only to Abeta. Coconut oil co-treatment also attenuates Abeta-induced mitochondrial alterations. The results of this pilot study provide a basis for further investigation of the effects of coconut oil, or its constituents, on neuronal survival focusing on mechanisms that may be involved.

24158021|t|Pyroglutamate-modified amyloid-beta protein demonstrates similar properties in an Alzheimer's disease familial mutant knock-in mouse and Alzheimer's disease brain.
24158021|a|BACKGROUND: N-terminally truncated, pyroglutamate-modified amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides are major constituents of amyloid deposits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Using a newly developed ELISA for Abeta modified at glutamate 3 with a pyroglutamate (pE3Abeta), brain pE3Abeta was characterized in human AD in an AD mouse model harboring double knock-in amyloid precursor protein (APP)-KM670/671NL and presenilin 1 (PS1)-P264L (APP/PS1-dKI) mutations, and in a second mouse model with transgenic overexpression of human APP695 with APP-KM670/671NL (Tg2576). RESULTS: pE3Abeta increased in the AD brain versus age-matched controls, with pE3Abeta/total Abeta at 45 and 10%, respectively. Compared to controls, the AD brain demonstrated 8.5-fold increased pE3Abeta compared to non-pE3Abeta species, which increased 2.7-fold. In the APP/PS1-dKI brain, pE3Abeta/total Abeta increased from 7% at 3 months to 16 and 19% at 15 and 19 months, respectively. In Tg2576, pE3Abeta/total Abeta was only 1.5% at 19 months, suggesting that APP/PS1-dKI, despite less total Abeta compared to Tg2576 at comparable ages, more closely mimics AD brain pathology. CONCLUSION: This report supports a significant role for pE3Abeta in AD pathogenesis by confirming that pE3Abeta represents a large fraction of Abeta within the AD brain. Compared to the age-matched control brain, pE3Abeta increased to a greater extent compared to Abeta species without this N-terminal modification. Further, the APP/PS1-dKI model more closely resembles the AD brain in this regard, compared to the Tg2576 model.

24164736|t|Glutaminyl cyclase in human cortex: correlation with (pGlu)-amyloid-beta load and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.
24164736|a|Brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients are characterized in part by the formation of high molecular weight aggregates of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides, which interfere with neuronal function and provoke neuronal cell death. The pyroglutamate (pGlu) modification of Abeta was demonstrated to be catalyzed by the enzyme glutaminyl cyclase (QC) and to enhance pathogenicity and neurotoxicity. Here, we addressed the role of QC in AD pathogenesis in human cortex. Two sets of human postmortem brain tissue from a total of 13 non-demented controls and 11 AD cases were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and unbiased stereology, quantitative RT-PCR, and enzymatic activity assays for the expression level of QC in temporal and entorhinal cortex. Additionally, cortical Abeta and pGlu-Abeta concentrations were quantified by ELISA. Data on QC expression and Abeta peptide concentrations were correlated with each other and with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) of individual cases. In control cases, QC expression was higher in the more vulnerable entorhinal cortex than in temporal cortex. In AD brains, QC mRNA expression and the immunoreactivity of QC were increased in both cortical regions and frequently associated with pGlu-Abeta deposits. The analyses of individual cases revealed significant correlations between QC mRNA levels and the concentration of insoluble pGlu-Abeta aggregates, but not of unmodified Abeta peptides. Elevated pGlu-Abeta load showed a better correlation with the decline in MMSE than elevated concentration of unmodified Abeta. Our observations provide evidence for an involvement of QC in AD pathogenesis and cognitive decline by QC-catalyzed pGlu-Abeta formation.

24164737|t|Isorhynchophylline treatment improves the amyloid-beta-induced cognitive impairment in rats via inhibition of neuronal apoptosis and tau protein hyperphosphorylation.
24164737|a|The progressive accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the form of senile plaques has been recognized as a key causative factor leading to the cognitive deficits seen in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent evidence indicates that Abeta induces neurotoxicity in the primary neuronal cultures as well as in the brain. Previously, we have demonstrated that isorhynchophylline (IRN), the major chemical ingredient of Uncaria rhynchophylla, possessed potent neuroprotective effects. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of IRN on cognitive function, neuronal apoptosis, and tau protein hyperphosphorylation in the hippocampus of the Abeta25-35-treated rats and to elucidate its action mechanisms. We showed that Abeta25-35 injection caused spatial memory impairment, neuronal apoptosis, and tau protein hyperphosphorylation. Treatment with IRN (20 or 40 mg/kg) for 21 days could significantly ameliorate the cognitive deficits induced by Abeta25-35 in the rats. In addition, IRN attenuated the Abeta25-35-induced neuronal apoptosis in hippocampus by down-regulating the protein and mRNA levels of the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-9, as well as suppressing the tau protein hyperphosphorylation at the Ser396, Ser404, and Thr205 sites. Mechanistic study showed that IRN could inhibit the glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) activity, and activate the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) substrate Akt. These results indicate that down-regulation of GSK-3beta activity and activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway are intimately involved in the neuroprotection of IRN. The experimental findings provide further evidence to affirm the potential of IRN as a worthy candidate for further development into a therapeutic agent for AD and other tau pathology-related neurodegenerative diseases.

24170094|t|Real-time probing of beta-amyloid self-assembly and inhibition using fluorescence self-quenching between neighbouring dyes.
24170094|a|The fluorescence response of the Thioflavin-T (ThT) dye and derivatives has become the standard tool for detecting beta-amyloid aggregates (Abeta) in solution. However, it is accepted that ThT-based methods suffer from important drawbacks. Some of these are due to the cationic structure of ThT, which limits its application at slightly acidic conditions; whereas some limitations are related to the general use of an extrinsic-dye sensing strategy and its intrinsic requirement for the formation of a sensor-binding site during the aggregation process. Here, we introduce fluorescence-self-quenching (FSQ) between N-terminally tagged peptides as a strategy to overcome some of these limitations. Using a combination of steady-state, picosecond time-resolved fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy, we characterize the fluorescence response of HiLyte fluor 555-labelled Abeta peptides and demonstrate that Abeta self-assembly organizes the covalently attached probes in close proximity to trigger the self-quenching sensing process over a broad range of conditions. Importantly, we prove that N-terminal tagging of beta-amyloid peptides does not alter the self-assembly kinetics or the resulting aggregated structures. We also tested the ability of FSQ-based methods to monitor the inhibition of Abeta1-42 aggregation using the small heat-shock protein Hsp20 as a model system. Overall, FSQ-based strategies for amyloid-sensing fill the gap between current morphology-specific protocols using extrinsic dyes, and highly-specialized single-molecule techniques that are difficult to implement in high-throughput analytical determinations. When performed in Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) format, the method becomes a ratiometric platform to gain insights into amyloid structure and for standardizing in vitro studies of amyloid aggregation.

24176625|t|Cholinergic basal forebrain atrophy predicts amyloid burden in Alzheimer's disease.
24176625|a|We compared accuracy of hippocampus and basal forebrain cholinergic system (BFCS) atrophy to predict cortical amyloid burden in 179 cognitively normal subjects (CN), 269 subjects with early stages of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 136 subjects with late stages of MCI, and 86 subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia retrieved from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Hippocampus and BFCS volumes were determined from structural magnetic resonance imaging scans at 3 Tesla, and cortical amyloid load from AV45 (florbetapir) positron emission tomography scans. In receiver operating characteristics analyses, BFCS volume provided significantly more accurate classification into amyloid-negative and -positive categories than hippocampus volume. In contrast, hippocampus volume more accurately identified the diagnostic categories of AD, late and early MCI, and CN compared with whole and anterior BFCS volume, whereas posterior BFCS and hippocampus volumes yielded similar diagnostic accuracy. In logistic regression analysis, hippocampus and posterior BFCS volumes contributed significantly to discriminate MCI and AD from CN, but only BFCS volume predicted amyloid status. Our findings suggest that BFCS atrophy is more closely associated with cortical amyloid burden than hippocampus atrophy in predementia AD.

24176981|t|Effect of amyloid on memory and non-memory decline from preclinical to clinical Alzheimer's disease.
24176981|a|High amyloid has been associated with substantial episodic memory decline over 18 and 36 months in healthy older adults and individuals with mild cognitive impairment. However, the nature and magnitude of amyloid-related memory and non-memory change from the preclinical to the clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease has not been evaluated over the same time interval. Healthy older adults (n = 320), individuals with mild cognitive impairment (n = 57) and individuals with Alzheimer's disease (n = 36) enrolled in the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle study underwent at least one positron emission tomography neuroimaging scan for amyloid. Cognitive assessments were conducted at baseline, and 18- and 36-month follow-up assessments. Compared with amyloid-negative healthy older adults, amyloid-positive healthy older adults, and amyloid-positive individuals with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease showed moderate and equivalent decline in verbal and visual episodic memory over 36 months (d's = 0.47-0.51). Relative to amyloid-negative healthy older adults, amyloid-positive healthy older adults showed no decline in non-memory functions, but amyloid-positive individuals with mild cognitive impairment showed additional moderate decline in language, attention and visuospatial function (d's = 0.47-1.12), and amyloid-positive individuals with Alzheimer's disease showed large decline in all aspects of memory and non-memory function (d's = 0.73-2.28). Amyloid negative individuals with mild cognitive impairment did not show any cognitive decline over 36 months. When non-demented individuals (i.e. healthy older adults and adults with mild cognitive impairment) were further dichotomized, high amyloid-positive non-demented individuals showed a greater rate of decline in episodic memory and language when compared with low amyloid positive non-demented individuals. Memory decline does not plateau with increasing disease severity, and decline in non-memory functions increases in amyloid-positive individuals with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. The combined detection of amyloid positivity and objectively-defined decline in memory are reliable indicators of early Alzheimer's disease, and the detection of decline in non-memory functions in amyloid-positive individuals with mild cognitive impairment may assist in determining the level of disease severity in these individuals. Further, these results suggest that grouping amyloid data into at least two categories of abnormality may be useful in determining the disease risk level in non-demented individuals.

24184799|t|Expression of A2V-mutated Abeta in Caenorhabditis elegans results in oligomer formation and toxicity.
24184799|a|Although Alzheimer's disease (AD) is usually sporadic, in a small proportion of cases it is familial and can be linked to mutations in beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP). Unlike the other genetic defects, the mutation [alanine-673 valine-673] (A673V) causes the disease only in the homozygous condition with enhanced amyloid beta (Abeta) production and aggregation; heterozygous carriers remain unaffected. It is not clear how misfolding and aggregation of Abeta is affected in vivo by this mutation and whether this correlates with its toxic effects. No animal models over-expressing the A673V-APP gene or alanine-2-valine (A2V) mutated human Abeta protein are currently available. Using the invertebrate Caenorhabditis elegans, we generated the first transgenic animal model to express the human Abeta1-40 wild-type (WT) in neurons or possess the A2V mutation (Abeta1-40A2V). Insertion of an Abeta-mutated gene into this nematode reproduced the homozygous state of the human pathology. Functional and biochemical characteristics found in the A2V strain were compared to those of transgenic C. elegans expressing Abeta1-40WT. The expression of both WT and A2V Abeta1-40 specifically reduced the nematode's lifespan, causing behavioral defects and neurotransmission impairment which were worse in A2V worms. Mutant animals were more resistant than WT to paralysis induced by the cholinergic agonist levamisole, indicating that the locomotor defect was specifically linked to postsynaptic dysfunctions. The toxicity caused by the mutated protein was associated with a high propensity to form oligomeric assemblies which accumulate in the neurons, suggesting this to be the central event involved in the postsynaptic damage and early onset of the disease in homozygous human A673V carriers.

24189446|t|Donepezil inhibits the amyloid-beta oligomer-induced microglial activation in vitro and in vivo.
24189446|a|Recent studies on Alzheimer's disease (AD) have focused on soluble oligomeric forms of amyloid-beta (Abeta oligomer, AbetaO) that are directly associated with AD-related pathologies, such as cognitive decline, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation. Donepezil is a well-known anti-dementia agent that increases acetylcholine levels through inhibition of acetylcholinesterase. However, a growing body of experimental and clinical studies indicates that donepezil may also provide neuroprotective and disease-modifying effects in AD. Additionally, donepezil has recently been demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory effects against lipopolysaccharides and tau pathology. However, it remains unknown whether donepezil has anti-inflammatory effects against AbetaO in cultured microglial cells and the brain in animals. Further, the effects of donepezil against AbetaO-mediated neuronal death, astrogliosis, and memory impairment have also not yet been investigated. Thus, in the present study, we examined the anti-inflammatory effect of donepezil against AbetaO and its neuroinflammatory mechanisms. Donepezil significantly attenuated the release of inflammatory mediators (prostaglandin E2, interleukin-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and nitric oxide) from microglia. Donepezil also decreased AbetaO-induced up-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 protein and phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase as well as translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B. We next showed that donepezil suppresses activated microglia-mediated toxicity in primary hippocampal cells using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. In intrahippocampal AbetaO-injected mice, donepezil significantly inhibited microgliosis and astrogliosis. Furthermore, behavioral tests revealed that donepezil (2 mg/kg/day, 5 days, p.o.) significantly ameliorated AbetaO-induced memory impairment. These results suggest that donepezil directly inhibits microglial activation induced by AbetaO through blocking MAPK and NF-kappaB signaling and, in part, contributing to the amelioration of neurodegeneration and memory impairment.

24199868|t|Single point mutations induce a switch in the molecular mechanism of the aggregation of the Alzheimer's disease associated Abeta42 peptide.
24199868|a|Single point mutations in the Alzheimer's disease associated Abeta42 peptide are found to alter significantly its neurotoxic properties in vivo and have been associated with early onset forms of this devastating condition. We show that such mutations can induce structural changes in Abeta42 fibrils and are associated with a dramatic switch in the fibril-dependent mechanism by which Abeta42 aggregates. These observations reveal how subtle perturbations to the physicochemical properties of the Abeta peptide, and the structural properties of fibrils that it forms, can have profound effects on the mechanism of its aggregation and pathogenicity.

24199960|t|Markers of cholesterol transport are associated with amyloid deposition in the brain.
24199960|a|Cholesterol is implicated in the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). We sought to determine the associations between beta amyloid (Abeta) plaque deposition in vivo using Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) and several indices of cholesterol homeostasis (i.e., total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), clusterin, oxysterol metabolites of cholesterol, and previously reported genes associated with late-onset AD) in 175 nondemented elderly subjects. High Abeta deposition was associated significantly with a lower Mini-Mental State Examination score (<27 points, p = 0.04), high systolic blood pressure (p = 0.04), carrying the apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele (p < 0.01), and lower plasma ApoE levels (p = 0.02), and variation in the ABCA7 (p = 0.02) and EPHA1 genes (p = 0.02). Cholesterol measures were not related to Abeta deposition in this cohort of nondemented elderly adults. However, plasma and genetic factors relating to cholesterol transport were associated with Abeta deposition in the brain. A better understanding of cholesterol transport mechanisms may lead to the design of potential targets for the prevention of Abeta deposition in the brain.

24199961|t|Disentangling the effects of age and APOE on neuropathology and late life cognitive decline.
24199961|a|Age and APOE are the most robust risk factors for dementia and cognitive decline, but the underlying neurobiology remains unclear. We examined the extent to which the hallmark pathologies of Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body disease, and cerebrovascular diseases account for the association of age and APOE with decline in episodic memory versus nonepisodic cognitive abilities. Up to 20 waves of longitudinal cognitive data were collected from 858 autopsied participants in 2 ongoing clinical-pathologic cohort studies of aging. Neuropathologic examinations quantified measures of beta amyloid (Abeta) plaque, mesial temporal and neocortical neurofibrillary tangles, macro- and microinfarcts, and neocortical Lewy bodies. Random coefficient models estimated person-specific slopes of decline in episodic memory and nonepisodic cognition. Path analysis examined the relation of age, APOE, and the 6 pathologic indices to the slopes of cognitive decline. The effect of age on decline in episodic memory was mediated by Abeta, mesial temporal and neocortical tau tangles, and macroscopic infarcts; age on decline in nonepisodic cognition was mediated by Abeta, neocortical tangles, and macroscopic infarcts. The effect of APOE on decline in episodic memory was mediated by Abeta, mesial temporal and neocortical tangles, and neocortical Lewy bodies; APOE on nonepisodic cognition was mediated by Abeta, neocortical tangles, and neocortical Lewy bodies. There were no direct effects of age and APOE on decline after accounting for these pathologic pathways.

24200086|t|Probing the interplay between amyloidogenic proteins and membranes using lipid monolayers and bilayers.
24200086|a|Many degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's involve proteins that have a tendency to misfold and aggregate eventually forming amyloid fibers. This review describes the use of monolayers, bilayers, supported membranes, and vesicles as model systems that have helped elucidate the mechanisms and consequences of the interactions between amyloidogenic proteins and membranes. These are twofold: membranes favor the formation of amyloid structures and these induce damage in those membranes. We describe studies that show how interfaces, especially charged ones, favor amyloidogenic protein aggregation by several means. First, surfaces increase the effective protein concentration reducing a three-dimensional system to a two-dimensional one. Second, charged surfaces allow electrostatic interactions with the protein. Anionic lipids as well as rafts, rich in cholesterol and gangliosides, prove to play an especially important role. Finally, these amphipathic systems also offer a hydrophobic environment favoring conformational changes, oligomerization, and eventual formation of mature fibers. In addition, we examine several models for membrane permeabilization: protein pores, leakage induced by extraction of lipids, chaotic pores, and membrane tension, presenting illustrative examples of experimental evidence in support of these models. The picture that emerges from recent work is one where more than one mechanism is in play. Which mechanism prevails depends on the protein, its aggregation state, and the lipid environment in which the interactions occur.

24200817|t|Decreased rabphilin 3A immunoreactivity in Alzheimer's disease is associated with Abeta burden.
24200817|a|Synaptic dysfunction, together with neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and cholinergic neuron loss is an established finding in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) neocortex. The synaptopathology of AD is known to involve both pre- and postsynaptic components. However, the status of rabphilin 3A (RPH3A), which interacts with the SNARE complex and regulates synaptic vesicle exocytosis and Ca(2+)-triggered neurotransmitter release, is at present unclear. In this study, we measured RPH3A and its ligand Rab3A as well as several SNARE proteins in postmortem neocortex of patients with AD, and found specific reductions of RPH3A immunoreactivity compared with aged controls. RPH3A loss correlated with dementia severity, cholinergic deafferentation, and increased beta-amyloid (Abeta) concentrations. Furthermore, RPH3A expression is selectively downregulated in cultured neurons treated with Abeta25-35 peptides. Our data suggest that presynaptic SNARE dysfunction forms part of the synaptopathology of AD.

24203698|t|Dual-tagged amyloid-beta precursor protein reveals distinct transport pathways of its N- and C-terminal fragments.
24203698|a|The amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP), a type I transmembrane protein genetically associated with Alzheimer's disease, has a complex biology that includes proteolytic processing into potentially toxic fragments, extensive trafficking and multiple, yet poorly-defined functions. We recently proposed that a significant fraction of APP is proteolytically cleaved in the neuronal soma into N- and C-terminal fragments (NTFs and CTFs), which then target independently of each other to separate destinations in the cell. Here, we prove this concept with live imaging and immunolocalization of two dual, N- and C-termini-tagged APP constructs: CFP-APP-YFP [containing the fluorescent tags, cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)] and FLAG-APP-Myc. When expressed at low levels in neuronal cells, these constructs are processed into differently tagged NTFs and CTFs that reveal distinct distributions and characteristics of transport. Like the endogenous N- and C-terminal epitopes of APP, the FLAG-tagged NTFs are present in trains of vesicles and tubules that localize to short filaments, which often immunostain for acetylated tubulin, whereas the Myc-tagged CTFs are detected on randomly distributed vesicle-like structures. The experimental treatments that selectively destabilize the acetylated microtubules abrogate the distribution of NTFs along filaments, without altering the random distribution of CTFs. These results indicate that the NTFs and CTFs are recruited to distinct transport pathways and reach separate destinations in neurons, where they likely accomplish functions independent of the parental, full-length APP. They also point to a compartment associated with acetylated microtubules in the neuronal soma--not the neurite terminals--as a major site of APP cleavage, and segregation of NTFs from CTFs.

24210593|t|Why Alzheimer trials fail: removing soluble oligomeric beta amyloid is essential, inconsistent, and difficult.
24210593|a|Before amyloid formation, peptides cleaved from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) exist as soluble oligomers. These are extremely neurotoxic. Their concentration is strongly correlated with synaptic impairment in animals and parallel cognitive decline in animals and humans. Clinical trials have largely been aimed at removing insoluble beta amyloid in senile plaques and have not reduced soluble load. Even treatment that should remove soluble oligomers has not consistently reduced the load. Failure to significantly improve cognition has frequently been attributed to failure of the amyloid hypothesis or to irreversible alteration in the brain. Instead, trial failures may be because of failure to significantly reduce load of toxic Abeta oligomers. Moreover, targeting only synthesis of Abeta peptides, only the oligomers themselves, or only the final insoluble amyloid may fail to significantly reduce soluble load because of the interrelationship between these 3 points in the amyloid cascade. Thus, treatments may fail unless trials target simultaneously all 3 points in the equation-"triple therapy". Cerebrospinal fluid analysis and other monitoring tools may in the future provide reliable measurement of soluble load. But currently, only analysis of autopsied brains can provide this data and thus enable proper evaluation and explanation of the outcome of clinical trials. These data are essential before attributing trial failures to the advanced nature of the disease or asserting that failures prove that the theory linking Alzheimer's disease to products of amyloid precursor protein is incorrect.

24214287|t|A promising method to distinguish vascular dementia from Alzheimer's disease with standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography and quantitative EEG.
24214287|a|In clinical settings, it is difficult to distinguish Alzheimer's disease (AD) from vascular dementia (VD). The present study summarizes a clinical method to distinguish VD and AD at the early stage of the diseases. This study evaluated the possibility of differentiating 25 VD, 25 AD, and 25 healthy individuals (control, CN) by means of power spectral analysis and standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) within alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1, beta 2, delta, and theta frequency bands. Electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral analysis and sLORETA indicated that higher diffuse delta/theta and lower central/ posterior fast frequency bands were present in AD compared with CN. VD showed diffuse increased theta power compared with CN and lower delta than AD. AD also presented diffuse higher theta on spectral analysis and decreased alpha 2 and beta 1 values in central/temporal regions by sLORETA. Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were significantly associated with frontal alpha 1 sLORETA solutions (r = 0.91616, P < .001) and relative power (r = 0.87322, P < .01) in AD, but no correlations were found in VD. In conclusion, EEG spectral and sLORETA together could be a tool to distinguish the different EEG rhythmic activities in AD and VD.

24215712|t|Wild type and mutant amyloid precursor proteins influence downstream effects of proteasome and autophagy inhibition.
24215712|a|Cells rely on complementary proteolytic pathways including the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy to maintain proper protein degradation. There is known to be considerable interplay between them, whereby the loss of one clearance system results in compensatory changes in other proteolytic pathways of the cell. Disturbances in proteolysis are known to occur in Alzheimer's disease, and potentially contribute to neurophysiological and neurodegenerative processes. Currently, few data are available on how the presence of wild type and mutant amyloid precursor protein (APPwt and APPmut) potentially alters the reciprocal interplay between the different intracellular proteolytic pathways. This study used human SH-SY5Y neuronal cell lines, and SH-SY5Y transfected with either APPwt or APPmut (valine-to-glycine substitution at position 717), in order to explore if the presence of APPwt or APPmut altered the downstream effects of pharmacological proteasome or autophagy inhibition. The occurrence of APPwt or APPmut was observed to disturb proteasome or autophagy activities upon treatment with proteasome inhibitors or authophagy inhibitors. Interestingly, APPwt and APPmut expression was observed to significantly and robustly enhance the induction in cathepsin B following the administration of an established proteasome inhibitor. The presence of APPwt and APPmut also significantly reduced the elevation in ubiquitinated proteins following proteasome inhibitor treatments. Our data strongly suggest that APP is able to affect the downstream effects of protease inhibition in neural cells including enhancement of cathepsin B activity, with these changes in cathepsin B significantly and inversely related to the levels of ubiquitinated protein.

24219385|t|Abeta-induced microglial cell activation is inhibited by baicalin through the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.
24219385|a|Baicalin has shown multiple neuroprotective biological activities, including antiapoptotic and anti-inflammatory functions in neurodegeneration diseases. However, whether baicalin can regulate Abeta-induced microglial activation or inhibit inflammatory cytokine secretion has not been confirmed. We demonstrated that baicalin can inhibit beta amyloid peptides (Abeta42)-induced BV2 microglial cell proliferation, reduce the expression of CD11b, decrease chemotactic ability of BV2 cells and significantly inhibit the secretion of IL-6, TNF-alpha and NO. Moreover, baicalin pretreatment can effectively inhibit Abeta-induced phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3. Baicalin can inhibit Abeta-induced microglial cell activation by regulating the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in AD transgenic mice. The modulation of microglial proliferation, activation and secretion by baicalin could be a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

24228859|t|Streptozotocin-induced diabetes increases amyloid plaque deposition in AD transgenic mice through modulating AGEs/RAGE/NF-kappaB pathway.
24228859|a|BACKGROUND: An increasing number of studies have demonstrated of that diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with an increased prevalence of Alzheimer disease (AD), the underlying mechanisms are still obscure. METHODS: We developed a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic AD transgenic mouse model and evaluated the effect of hyperglycemia on senile plaque formation. RESULTS: Our data showed that administration of STZ increased the level of blood glucose and increased the advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in brain tissue, and further enhanced the expression levels of the receptor for AGEs (RAGE) and the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) in the brain, and accelerated the senile plaque formation in the transgenic mice. Our results showed that STZ-induced insulin-deficient hyperglycemia caused the pathophysiology of AD in APP/PS1 transgenic mice by modulating the AGEs/RAGE/NF-kappaB pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that there is a close linkage of DM and cerebral amyloidosis in the pathogenesis of AD.

24229499|t|Protective effect of pranlukast on Abeta1-42-induced cognitive deficits associated with downregulation of cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1.
24229499|a|Deposition of extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide is one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Accumulation of Abeta is thought to associate with cognition deficits, neuroinflammation and apoptosis observed in AD. However, effective neuroprotective approaches against Abeta neurotoxicity are unavailable. In the present study, we analysed the effects of pranlukast, a selective cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLT1R) antagonist, on the impairment of learning and memory formation induced by Abeta and the probable underlying electrophysiological and molecular mechanisms. We found that bilateral intrahippocampal injection of Abeta1-42 resulted in a significant decline of spatial learning and memory of mice in the Morris water maze (MWM) and Y-maze tests, together with a serious depression of in vivo hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region of the mice. Importantly, this treatment caused significant increases in CysLT1R expression and subsequent NF-kappaB signaling, caspase-3 activation and Bcl-2 downregulation in the hippocampus or prefrontal cortex. Oral administration of pranlukast at 0.4 or 0.8 mg/kg for 4 wk significantly reversed Abeta1-42-induced impairments of cognitive function and hippocampal LTP in mice. Furthermore, pranlukast reversed Abeta1-42-induced CysLT1R upregulation, and markedly suppressed the Abeta1-42-triggered NF-kappaB pathway, caspase-3 activation and Bcl-2 downregulation in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in mice. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay confirmed its presence in the brain after oral administration of pranlukast in mice. These data disclose novel findings about the therapeutic potential of pranlukast, revealing a previously unknown therapeutic possibility to treat memory deficits associated with AD.

24231553|t|Impaired hippocampal acetylcholine release parallels spatial memory deficits in Tg2576 mice subjected to basal forebrain cholinergic degeneration.
24231553|a|The Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model Tg2576 overexpresses an AD associated mutant variant of human APP and accumulates amyloid beta (Abeta) in an age-dependent manner. Using the selective cholinergic immunotoxin mu p75-saporin (SAP), we induced a partial basal forebrain cholinergic degeneration (BFCD) in 3 months old male Tg2576 mice to co-express cholinergic degeneration with Abeta overexpression as these characteristics constitutes key hallmarks of AD. At 9 months, SAP lesioned Tg2576 mice were cognitively impaired in two spatial paradigms addressing working memory and mid to long-term memory. Conversely, there was no deterioration of cognitive functioning in sham lesioned Tg2576 mice or wild type littermates (wt) receiving the immunotoxin. At 10 months of age, release of acetylcholine (ACh) was addressed by microdialysis in conscious mice. Scopolamine-induced increases in hippocampal ACh efflux was significantly reduced in SAP lesioned Tg2576 mice compared to sham lesioned Tg2576 mice. Intriguingly, there was no significant difference in ACh efflux between wt treatment groups. Following SAP treatment, choline acetyltransferase activity was reduced in the hippocampus and frontal cortex and the reduction was comparable between groups. Our results suggest that partial BFCD acts collectively with increased levels of Abeta to induce cognitive decline and to compromise cholinergic release. Tg2576 mice with BFCD may constitute a new and suitable AD mouse model to study the interrelations between cholinergic deficits and amsyloid deposition.

24239249|t|Origin of the PSEN1 E280A mutation causing early-onset Alzheimer's disease.
24239249|a|BACKGROUND: A mutation in presenilin 1 (E280A) causes early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Understanding the origin of this mutation will inform medical genetics. METHODS: We sequenced the genomes of 102 individuals from Antioquia, Colombia. We applied identity-by-descent analysis to identify regions of common ancestry. We estimated the age of the E280A mutation and the local ancestry of the haplotype harboring this mutation. RESULTS: All affected individuals share a minimal haplotype of 1.8 Mb containing E280A. We estimate a time to most recent common ancestor of E280A of 10 (95% credible interval, 7.2-12.6) generations. We date the de novo mutation event to 15 (95% credible interval, 11-25) generations ago. We infer a western European geographic origin of the shared haplotype. CONCLUSIONS: The age and geographic origin of E280A are consistent with a single founder dating from the time of the Spanish Conquistadors who began colonizing Colombia during the early 16th century.

24239250|t|Cerebrospinal fluid BACE1 activity and markers of amyloid precursor protein metabolism and axonal degeneration in Alzheimer's disease.
24239250|a|OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP)-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) activity in relation to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to correlate the enzyme activity with protein markers of APP metabolism and axonal degeneration. METHODS: BACE1 activity and protein concentrations were measured and analyzed in 342 participants of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, including 99 normal control, 75 stable mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 87 progressive MCI, and 79 AD dementia cases. All statistical analyses were Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: No significant differences between controls and any of the three patient groups were detected for BACE1 activity and soluble APPbeta (sAPPbeta) concentrations in CSF. Significant correlations with BACE1 activity were found for CSF APPbeta and total tau in all four groups and for CSF phosphorylated tau181 in all groups but the progressive MCI group. There were no correlations for CSF amyloid beta (Abeta)1-42 or for plasma Abeta1-42 and Abeta1-40. CONCLUSIONS: The consistent correlation between BACE1 activity and sAPPbeta supports their role as biomarkers of target engagement in clinical trials on BACE1 inhibition.

24240640|t|Structural diversity of Alzheimer's disease amyloid-beta dimers and their role in oligomerization and fibril formation.
24240640|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with the formation of toxic amyloid-beta (Abeta)42 oligomers, and recent evidence supports a role for Abeta dimers as building blocks for oligomers. Molecular dynamics simulation studies have identified clans for the dominant conformations of Abeta42 forming dimers; however, it is unclear if a larger spectrum of dimers is involved and which set(s) of dimers might evolve to oligomers verse fibrils. Therefore, for this study we generated multiple structural conformations of Abeta42, using explicit all-atom molecular dynamics, and then clustering the different structures based on key conformational similarities. Those matching a selection threshold were then used to model a process of oligomerization. Remarkably, we showed a greater diversity in Abeta dimers than previously described. Depending on the clan family, different types of Abeta dimers were obtained. While some had the tendency to evolve into oligomeric rings, others formed fibrils of diverse characteristics. Then we selected the dimers that would evolve to membranephilic annular oligomers. Nearly one third of the 28 evaluated annular oligomers had the dimer interfaces between the neighboring Abeta42 monomers with possible salt bridges between the residue K28 from one side and either residue E22 or D23 on the other. Based on these results, key amino acids were identified for point mutations that either enhanced or suppressed the formation and toxicity of oligomer rings. Our studies suggest a greater diversity of Abeta dimers. Understanding the structure of Abeta dimers might be important for the rationale design of small molecules that block formation of toxic oligomers.

24240735|t|The role of pro-inflammatory S100A9 in Alzheimer's disease amyloid-neuroinflammatory cascade.
24240735|a|Pro-inflammatory S100A9 protein is increasingly recognized as an important contributor to inflammation-related neurodegeneration. Here, we provide insights into S100A9 specific mechanisms of action in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Due to its inherent amyloidogenicity S100A9 contributes to amyloid plaque formation together with Abeta. In traumatic brain injury (TBI) S100A9 itself rapidly forms amyloid plaques, which were reactive with oligomer-specific antibodies, but not with Abeta and amyloid fibrillar antibodies. They may serve as precursor-plaques for AD, implicating TBI as an AD risk factor. S100A9 was observed in some hippocampal and cortical neurons in TBI, AD and non-demented aging. In vitro S100A9 forms neurotoxic linear and annular amyloids resembling Abeta protofilaments. S100A9 amyloid cytotoxicity and native S100A9 pro-inflammatory signaling can be mitigated by its co-aggregation with Abeta, which results in a variety of micron-scale amyloid complexes. NMR and molecular docking demonstrated transient interactions between native S100A9 and Abeta. Thus, abundantly present in AD brain pro-inflammatory S100A9, possessing also intrinsic amyloidogenic properties and ability to modulate Abeta aggregation, can serve as a link between the AD amyloid and neuroinflammatory cascades and as a prospective therapeutic target.

24246421|t|Preferred features of a fluorine-19 MRI probe for amyloid detection in the brain.
24246421|a|Fluorine-19 magnetic resonance imaging (19F MRI) could be a promising approach for imaging amyloid deposition in the brain. However, the required features of a 19F MRI probe for amyloid detection remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated a series of compounds as potent 19F probes that could prevent the reduction in MR signal when bound to amyloid plaques in the brain. Each compound consists of styrylbenzoxazole as a core structure linked by a different length of polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain to one of three types of fluorine-labeled group: a trifluoroethoxy group, a hexafluoroisopropoxy group, or a 3',5'-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzylamino group. Among these compounds, 6-(3',6',9',15',18',21'-heptaoxa-23',23',23'-trifluoro tricosanyloxy)-2-(4'-dimethylaminostyryl)benzoxazole [compound 3b (m = 6)], which has a trifluoroethoxy group with seven ethylene glycol groups in the PEG chain, showed significant 19F MR signals in the brains of AbetaPPswe/PS1dE9 double-transgenic mice, but not wild-type mice. This suggested that compound 3b (m = 6) could be a useful 19F MRI probe for amyloid detection. Furthermore, this study identified the most effective length of PEG chain between the fluorine-labeled group and the core structure to ensure a strong MR signal when the probe is bound to amyloid plaques.

24249638|t|Amyloid precursor protein alpha- and beta-cleaved ectodomains exert opposing control of cholesterol homeostasis via SREBP2.
24249638|a|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is ubiquitously expressed. Studies in neuronal cells have implicated APP or its fragments as negative regulators of cholesterol metabolism. In the current study, APP acted, via its alpha-cleavage, as a positive regulator of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP2) signaling in human astrocytic cells (U251MG), hepatic cells (HepG2), and primary fibroblasts, leading to an approximate 30% increase in SRE-dependent gene expression and, consequently, enhanced cholesterol biosynthesis and LDL receptor levels. This effect was mediated via the secretory ectodomain APPsalpha. The beta-cleaved ectodomain, in turn, repressed SRE-dependent gene expression by up to ~ 30%. This resulted in decreased cholesterol synthesis and LDL receptor content, establishing a physiological feedback loop in cholesterol-loaded cells, where APP undergoes preferential beta-cleavage. Patients with familial Alzheimer's disease had decreased circulating lathosterol, reflecting hepatic cholesterol synthesis, and their fibroblasts had reduced LDL receptor content, which was alleviated by decreasing beta-cleavage. These results show that APP regulates cholesterol metabolism in cells relevant for whole-body cholesterol balance and reveal that APP alpha- and beta-cleavages produce opposing paracrine regulators of SREBP2 signaling.

24252258|t|Rates of diagnostic transition and cognitive change at 18-month follow-up among 1,112 participants in the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL).
24252258|a|BACKGROUND: The Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) Flagship Study of Ageing is a prospective study of 1,112 individuals (211 with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 133 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 768 healthy controls (HCs)). Here we report diagnostic and cognitive findings at the first (18-month) follow-up of the cohort. The first aim was to compute rates of transition from HC to MCI, and MCI to AD. The second aim was to characterize the cognitive profiles of individuals who transitioned to a more severe disease stage compared with those who did not. METHODS: Eighteen months after baseline, participants underwent comprehensive cognitive testing and diagnostic review, provided an 80 ml blood sample, and completed health and lifestyle questionnaires. A subgroup also underwent amyloid PET and MRI neuroimaging. RESULTS: The diagnostic status of 89.9% of the cohorts was determined (972 were reassessed, 28 had died, and 112 did not return for reassessment). The 18-month cohort comprised 692 HCs, 82 MCI cases, 197 AD patients, and one Parkinson's disease dementia case. The transition rate from HC to MCI was 2.5%, and cognitive decline in HCs who transitioned to MCI was greatest in memory and naming domains compared to HCs who remained stable. The transition rate from MCI to AD was 30.5%. CONCLUSION: There was a high retention rate after 18 months. Rates of transition from healthy aging to MCI, and MCI to AD, were consistent with established estimates. Follow-up of this cohort over longer periods will elucidate robust predictors of future cognitive decline.

24254706|t|RanBP9 overexpression down-regulates phospho-cofilin, causes early synaptic deficits and impaired learning, and accelerates accumulation of amyloid plaques in the mouse brain.
24254706|a|Loss of synaptic proteins and functional synapses in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as transgenic mouse models expressing amyloid-beta protein precursor is now well established. However, the earliest age at which such loss of synapses occurs, and whether known markers of AD progression accelerate functional deficits is completely unknown. We previously showed that RanBP9 overexpression leads to enhanced amyloid plaque burden in a mouse model of AD. In this study, we found significant reductions in the levels of synaptophysin and spinophilin, compared with wild-type controls, in both the cortex and the hippocampus of 5- and 6-month old but not 3- or 4-month old APDeltaE9/RanBP9 triple transgenic mice, and not in APDeltaE9 double transgenic mice, nor in RanBP9 single transgenic mice. Interestingly, amyloid plaque burden was also increased in the APDeltaE9/RanBP9 mice at 5-6 months. Consistent with these results, we found significant deficits in learning and memory in the APDeltaE9/RanBP9 mice at 5 and 6 month. These data suggest that increased amyloid plaques and accelerated learning and memory deficits and loss of synaptic proteins induced by RanBP9 are correlated. Most importantly, APDeltaE9/RanBP9 mice also showed significantly reduced levels of the phosphorylated form of cofilin in the hippocampus. Taken together these data suggest that RanBP9 overexpression down-regulates cofilin, causes early synaptic deficits and impaired learning, and accelerates accumulation of amyloid plaques in the mouse brain.

24257073|t|Transient disturbances in contextual fear memory induced by Abeta(25-35) in rats are accompanied by cholinergic dysfunction.
24257073|a|Damage to the medial septum (MS) or disruption of the septo-hippocampal pathway is often considered as a basis for memory impairments, manifesting in the hippocampus-dependent behavioral paradigms. In the present study, we have examined the effects of intracerebroventricular administration of aggregated amyloid-beta (25-35) (Abeta(25-35)) on contextual fear conditioning and the condition of cholinergic neurons in the MS using immunohistochemical detection of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and expression of the "cholinergic locus genes" (ChAT and vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VaChT) mRNA). A single injection of Abeta(25-35) induced transient moderate impairments in contextual fear conditioning accompaniedby a decrease in ChAT expression. However, the long-term decline in ChAT and VaChT expression was not associated with stable impairments in contextual fear memory. An Abeta(25-35)-induced progressive decrease in the number of ChAT expressing neurons in the MS was revealed, but no gross neuronal cell loss in the MS could be detected (as judged by the density of NeuN-immunoreactive cells). Thus, Abeta(25-35) induced a loss of the cholinergic phenotype of septal neurons without neuronal cell death in MS. The data give an additional support to the concept of early impairments in the synthesis of proteins related to the cholinergic system as an important mechanism in amyloid-induced neuronal damage.

24262202|t|SET translocation is associated with increase in caspase cleaved amyloid precursor protein in CA1 of Alzheimer and Down syndrome patients.
24262202|a|Caspase cleaved amyloid precursor protein (APPcc) and SET are increased and mislocalized in the neuronal cytoplasm in Alzheimer Disease (AD) brains. Translocated SET to the cytoplasm can induce tau hyperphosphorylation. To elucidate the putative relationships between mislocalized APPcc and SET, we studied their level and distribution in the hippocampus of 5 controls, 3 Down syndrome and 10 Alzheimer patients. In Down syndrome and Alzheimer patients, APPcc and SET levels were increased in CA1 and the frequency of both localizations in the neuronal cytoplasm was high in CA1, and low in CA4. As the increase of APPcc is already present at early stages of AD, we overexpressed APPcc in CA1 and the dentate gyrus neurons of adult mice with a lentiviral construct. APPcc overexpression in CA1 and not in the dentate gyrus induced endogenous SET translocation and tau hyperphosphorylation. These data suggest that increase in APPcc in CA1 neurons could be an early event leading to the translocation of SET and the progression of AD through tau hyperphosphorylation.

24263411|t|Protective effect of paeoniflorin on Abeta25-35-induced SH-SY5Y cell injury by preventing mitochondrial dysfunction.
24263411|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative brain disorder affecting about 14 million people worldwide. Abeta-induced cell injury is a crucial cause of neuronal loss in AD, thus the suppression of which might be useful for the treatment of this disease. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of paeoniflorin (PF), a monoterpene glycoside isolated from aqueous extract of Radix Paeoniae Alba, on Abeta25-35-induced cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. The results showed PF could attenuate or restore the viability loss, apoptotic increase, and ROS production induced by Abeta25-35 in SH-SY5Y cells. In addition, PF strikingly inhibited Abeta25-35-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, which includes decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, cytochrome c release and activity of caspase-3 and caspase-9. Therefore, our study provided the first experimental evidence that PF could modulate ROS production and apoptotic mitochondrial pathway in model of neuron injury in vitro and which might provide new insights into its application toward Alzheimer's disease therapy.

24265106|t|Neural stem cell transplantation improves spatial learning and memory via neuronal regeneration in amyloid-beta precursor protein/presenilin 1/tau triple transgenic mice.
24265106|a|Neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation has recently become a main research target for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment. In the present study, we transplanted NSCs from C57BL/6 mice into the hippocampus in the 12-month-old triple transgenic model of AD (3 x Tg) and determined whether NSC transplantation can alleviate impairments in spatial learning and memory via neuronal regeneration in AD mice. Two months after transplantation, Morris water maze tests suggested that spatial learning and memory in the 3 x Tg mice receiving NSCs was significantly improved compared to 3 x Tg mice not receiving NSCs. Furthermore, quantification of Nissl staining revealed that the number of neurons in the hippocampus of 3 x Tg mice receiving NSCs was significantly greater than that in 3 x Tg mice not receiving NSCs, indicating that new neurons were generated. These results may demonstrate that NSC transplantation can improve spatial learning and memory via neuronal regeneration in amyloid-beta precursor protein/presenilin 1/tau 3 x Tg mice.

24269535|t|New insights concerning insulin synthesis and its secretion in rat hippocampus and cerebral cortex: amyloid-beta1-42-induced reduction of proinsulin level via glycogen synthase kinase-3beta.
24269535|a|The reduction of insulin levels in hippocampal areas is associated with Alzheimer's disease. The present study using rat brain explores the mechanisms of insulin synthesis and secretion, as well as amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta(1-42))-induced reduction of proinsulin expression. After confirming the expression of insulin mRNA and proinsulin in rat brain, we visualized and analyzed the motion of insulin secretion in rat hippocampal neurons using pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein (pHluorin) fused to the insulin. In the rat hippocampal neurons expressing insulin-pHluorin, time-lapse confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed the appearance of fluorescent spots induced by depolarization after stimulation with 50 mM KCl. In these fluorescent spots, Ca(2+)-dependent activator protein for secretion 2 (CAPS2), which is the regulator of the dense-core vesicle involving neuronal peptides, was co-localized with insulin-pHluorin. However, Abeta(1-42)-induced reduction of proinsulin in rat hippocampal neurons was inhibited by treatment with lithium and transfection with glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) siRNA. These results demonstrate that synthesized insulin is secreted from rat hippocampal and cortical neuron's dense-core vesicles, and that activation of GSK-3beta in Abeta(1-42)-induced Alzheimer's model hippocampal neurons decreases the insulin synthesis.

24269929|t|Obesity in aging exacerbates blood-brain barrier disruption, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress in the mouse hippocampus: effects on expression of genes involved in beta-amyloid generation and Alzheimer's disease.
24269929|a|There is growing evidence that obesity has deleterious effects on the brain and cognitive function in the elderly population. However, the specific mechanisms through which aging and obesity interact to promote cognitive decline remain unclear. To test the hypothesis that aging exacerbates obesity-induced cerebromicrovascular damage and neuroinflammation, we compared young (7 months) and aged (24 months) high fat diet-fed obese C57BL/6 mice. Aging exacerbated obesity-induced systemic inflammation and blood-brain barrier disruption, as indicated by the increased circulating levels of proinflammatory cytokines and increased presence of extravasated immunoglobulin G in the hippocampus, respectively. Obesity-induced blood-brain barrier damage was associated with microglia activation, upregulation of activating Fc-gamma receptors and proinflammatory cytokines, and increased oxidative stress. Treatment of cultured primary microglia with sera derived from aged obese mice resulted in significantly more pronounced microglia activation and oxidative stress, as compared with treatment with young sera. Serum-induced activation and oxidative stress were also exacerbated in primary microglia derived from aged animals. Hippocampal expression of genes involved in regulation of the cellular amyloid precursor protein-dependent signaling pathways, beta-amyloid generation, and the pathogenesis of tauopathy were largely unaffected by obesity in aged mice. Collectively, obesity in aging is associated with a heightened state of systemic inflammation, which exacerbates blood-brain barrier disruption. The resulting neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in the mouse hippocampus likely contribute to the significant cognitive decline observed in aged obese animals.

24270205|t|Hippocampal sclerosis of aging is a key Alzheimer's disease mimic: clinical-pathologic correlations and comparisons with both alzheimer's disease and non-tauopathic frontotemporal lobar degeneration.
24270205|a|Hippocampal sclerosis of aging (HS-Aging) neuropathology was observed in more than 15% of aged individuals in prior studies. However, much remains unknown about the clinical correlates of HS-Aging pathology or the association(s) between HS-Aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) pathology. Clinical and comorbid pathological features linked to HS-Aging pathology were analyzed using National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) data. From autopsy data extending back to 1990 (n = 9,817 participants), the neuropathological diagnoses were evaluated from American AD Centers (ADCs). Among participants who died between 2005-2012 (n = 1,422), additional analyses identified clinical and pathological features associated with HS-Aging pathology. We also compared cognitive testing and longevity outcomes between HS-Aging cases and a subsample with non-tauopathy FTLD (n = 210). Reporting of HS-Aging pathology increased dramatically among ADCs in recent years, to nearly 20% of autopsies in 2012. Participants with relatively "pure" HS-Aging pathology were often diagnosed clinically as having probable (68%) or possible (15%) AD. However, the co-occurrence of HS-Aging pathology and AD neuropathology (AD-NP) did not indicate any pattern of correlation between the two pathologies. Compared with other pathologies, participants with HS-Aging pathology had higher overall cognitive/functional ability (versus AD-NP) and verbal fluency (versus both AD-NP and FTLD) but similar episodic memory impairment at one clinic visit 2-5 years prior to death. Patients with HS-Aging live considerably longer than patients with non-tauopathy FTLD. We conclude that the manifestations of HS-Aging, increasingly recognized in recent years, probably indicate a separate disease process of direct relevance to patient care, dementia research, and clinical trials.

24270855|t|OCIAD2 activates gamma-secretase to enhance amyloid beta production by interacting with nicastrin.
24270855|a|The gamma (gamma)-secretase holoenzyme is composed of four core proteins and cleaves APP to generate amyloid beta (Abeta), a key molecule that causes major neurotoxicity during the early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, despite its important role in Abeta production, little is known about the regulation of gamma-secretase. OCIAD2, a novel modulator of gamma-secretase that stimulates Abeta production, and which was isolated from a genome-wide functional screen using cell-based assays and a cDNA library comprising 6,178 genes. Ectopic expression of OCIAD2 enhanced Abeta production, while reduction of OCIAD2 expression suppressed it. OCIAD2 expression facilitated the formation of an active gamma-secretase complex and enhanced subcellular localization of the enzyme components to lipid rafts. OCIAD2 interacted with nicastrin to stimulate gamma-secretase activity. OCIAD2 also increased the interaction of nicastrin with C99 and stimulated APP processing via gamma-secretase activation, but did not affect Notch processing. In addition, a cell-permeable Tat-OCIAD2 peptide that interfered with the interaction of OCIAD2 with nicastrin interrupted the gamma-secretase-mediated AICD production. Finally, OCIAD2 expression was significantly elevated in the brain of AD patients and PDAPP mice. This study identifies OCIAD2 as a selective activator of gamma-secretase to increase Abeta generation.

24273049|t|Oxidative damage and amyloid-beta metabolism in brain regions of the longest-lived rodents.
24273049|a|Naked mole rats (NMRs) are the longest-lived rodents, with young individuals having high levels of Abeta in their brains. The purpose of this study was twofold: to assess the distribution of Abeta in key regions of NMR brains (cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum) and to understand whether the accumulation of Abeta is due to enhanced production or decreased degradation. Recent evidence indicates that lipid peroxides directly participate in induction of cytoprotective proteins, such as heat shock proteins (Hsps), which play a central role in the cellular mechanisms of stress tolerance. Amyloid precursor protein processing, lipid peroxidation, Hsps, redox status, and protein degradation processes were therefore assessed in key NMR brain regions. NMR brains had high levels of lipid peroxidation compared with mice, and the NMR hippocampus had the highest levels of the most toxic moiety of Abeta (soluble Abeta1 - 42 ). This was due not to increased Abeta production but rather to low antioxidant potential, which was associated with low induction of Hsp70 and heme oxygenase-1 as well as low ubiquitin-proteasome activity. NMRs may therefore serve as natural models for understanding the relationship between oxidative stress and Abeta levels and its effects on the brain.

24275092|t|Podoplanin is a substrate of presenilin-1/gamma-secretase.
24275092|a|Podoplanin (PDPN) is a mucin-like transmembrane glycoprotein that plays an important role in development and cancer. Here, we provide evidence that the intracellular domain (ICD) of podoplanin is released into the cytosol following a sequential proteolytic processing by a metalloprotease and gamma-secretase. Western blotting and cell fractionation studies revealed that HEK293T and MDCK cells transfected with an eGFP-tagged podoplanin construct (PDPNeGFP, 50-63kDa) constitutively express two C-terminal fragments (CTFs): a ~33kDa membrane-bound PCTF33, and a ~29kDa cytosolic podoplanin ICD (PICD). While pharmacological inhibition of metalloproteases reduced the expression of PCTF33, treatment of cells with gamma-secretase inhibitors resulted in enhanced PCTF33 levels. PCTF33 processing by gamma-secretase depends on presenilin-1 (PS1) function: cells expressing a dominant negative form of PS1 (PS1 D385N), and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) genetically deficient in PS1, but not in PS2, show higher levels of PCTF33 expression with respect to wild-type MEFs. Furthermore, transfection of PS1 deficient MEFs with wild-type PS1 (PS1 wt) decreased PCTF33 levels. N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the affinity purified PICD revealed that the gamma-secretase cleavage site was located between valines 150 and 151, but these residues are not critical for proteolysis. We found that podoplanin CTFs are also generated in cells expressing podoplanin mutants harboring heterologous transmembrane regions. Taken together, these results indicate that podoplanin is a novel substrate for PS1/gamma-secretase.

24275353|t|Inhibitory effects of beta-amyloid on the nicotinic receptors which stimulate glutamate release in rat hippocampus: the glial contribution.
24275353|a|We investigated on the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes involved in the cholinergic control of in vivo hippocampal glutamate (GLU), aspartate (ASP) and inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) overflow. We also investigated on the possible contribution of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors subtypes present on astrocytes in the regulation of the three neurotransmitter amino acids overflow using hippocampal gliosomes and on the effects of beta-amyloid (Abeta) 1-40 on the nicotinic control of amino acid neurotransmitter release. Nicotine was able to enhance the in vivo overflow of the three amino acids being more potent in stimulating GLU overflow. The alpha7 selective agonist PHA543613 induced an overflow very similar to that of nicotine. The alpha4beta2 selective agonist 5IA85380 was significantly less potent in inducing GLU overflow while the overflow of ASP and GABA were almost inconsistent. Abeta1-40 inhibited the neurotransmitter overflow stimulated by PHA543613 but not the one evoked by 5IA85380. In hippocampal gliosomes nicotine elicited selectively GLU overflow which was also evoked by 5IA85380 and by the alpha7 selective agonist choline. Nicotine- and choline-induced glutamate overflow in gliosomes was inhibited by Aalpha1-40. In conclusion nicotine administration in vivo elicits hippocampal GLU release mostly through alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors likely present both on neurons and astrocytes. Abeta inhibitory effect on the nicotinic-control of GLU release seems to depend primarily to the inhibition of alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors functional responses.

24283798|t|Simultaneous determination of post-translational racemization and isomerization of N-terminal amyloid-beta in Alzheimer's brain tissues by covalent chiral derivatized ultraperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.
24283798|a|Typical markers of protein aging are spontaneous post-translational modifications such as amino acid racemization (AAR) and amino acid isomerization (AAI) during the degradation of peptides. The post-translational AAR and AAI could significantly induce the density and localization of plaque deposition in brain tissues. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is reliably related to the formation and aggregation of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) plaques in the human brain. No current analytical methods can simultaneously determine AAR and AAI during the degradation of Abeta from AD patients. We now report a covalent chiral derivatized ultraperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (CCD-UPLC-MS/MS) method for the determination of post-translational AAR and AAI of N-terminal Abeta (N-Abeta1-5) in human brain tissues. When subjected to tryptic N-Abeta1-5 from post-translationally modified natural Abeta in focal brain tissues by the CCD procedure, it was monitored at m/z 989.6 637.0/678.9 during electrospray collision-induced dissociation. These N-Abeta1-5 fragments with l-aspartic acid (l-Asp), d-Asp, l-isoAsp, and d-isoAsp could be separated using the UPLC system with a conventional reversed-phase column and mobile phase. The quantification of these peptides was determined using a stable isotope [(15)N]-labeled Abeta1-40 internal standard. The CCD-UPLC-MS/MS assay of potential N-Abeta1-5 allowed for the discovery of the present and ratio levels of these N-Abeta1-5 sequences with l-Asp, d-Asp, l-isoAsp, and d-isoAsp.

24284412|t|Amyloid beta a4 precursor protein-binding family B member 1 (FE65) interactomics revealed synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) and sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2 (SERCA2) as new binding proteins in the human brain.
24284412|a|FE65 is a cytosolic adapter protein and an important binding partner of amyloid precursor protein. Dependent on Thr668 phosphorylation in amyloid precursor protein, which influences amyloidogenic amyloid precursor protein processing, FE65 undergoes nuclear translocation, thereby transmitting a signal from the cell membrane to the nucleus. As this translocation may be relevant in Alzheimer disease, and as FE65 consists of three protein-protein interaction domains able to bind and affect a variety of other proteins and downstream signaling pathways, the identification of the FE65 interactome is of central interest in Alzheimer disease research. In this study, we identified 121 proteins as new potential FE65 interacting proteins in a pulldown/mass spectrometry approach using human post-mortem brain samples as protein pools for recombinantly expressed FE65. Co-immunoprecipitation assays further validated the interaction of FE65 with the candidates SV2A and SERCA2. In parallel, we investigated the whole cell proteome of primary hippocampal neurons from FE65/FE65L1 double knockout mice. Notably, the validated FE65 binding proteins were also found to be differentially abundant in neurons derived from the FE65 knockout mice relative to wild-type control neurons. SERCA2 is an important player in cellular calcium homeostasis, which was found to be up-regulated in double knockout neurons. Indeed, knock-down of FE65 in HEK293T cells also evoked an elevated sensitivity to thapsigargin, a stressor specifically targeting the activity of SERCA2. Thus, our results suggest that FE65 is involved in the regulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis. Whereas transfection of FE65 alone caused a typical dot-like phenotype in the nucleus, co-transfection of SV2A significantly reduced the percentage of FE65 dot-positive cells, pointing to a possible role for SV2A in the modulation of FE65 intracellular targeting. Given that SV2A has a signaling function at the presynapse, its effect on FE65 intracellular localization suggests that the SV2A/FE65 interaction might play a role in synaptic signal transduction.

24287378|t|17beta-estradiol protects cerebellar granule cells against beta-amyloid-induced toxicity via the apoptotic mitochondrial pathway.
24287378|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a well-studied neurodegenerative disorder; nevertheless, significant therapeutic agents for the pharmacological treatment of this neuropathology are unavailable to date. The toxicity of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) has been implicated as a critical cause in the development of AD, and Abeta-amyloid-induced toxicity is typically associated with apoptosis. Here, we investigated the effect of 17beta-estradiol (E2) on Abeta-induced toxicity in cerebellar granule cells (CGCs). Our data showed a significant induction of apoptosis in neurons treated with Abeta, and the addition of E2 reduced this effect. In addition, E2 reduced the Abeta-induced up-regulation of Bax and down-regulation of Bcl-xL, and inhibited the subsequent mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and activation of caspase-3. Moreover, E2 inhibited Abeta-induced c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) activation. Taken together, these findings indicate that E2 protects against Abeta-induced apoptosis in neuronal cells by preventing mitochondrial dysfunction and interfering with the JNK signalling cascade.

24288245|t|Cannabidiol promotes amyloid precursor protein ubiquitination and reduction of beta amyloid expression in SHSY5YAPP+ cells through PPARgamma involvement.
24288245|a|The amyloidogenic cascade is regarded as a key factor at the basis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. The aberrant cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) induces an increased production and a subsequent aggregation of beta amyloid (Abeta) peptide in limbic and association cortices. As a result, altered neuronal homeostasis and oxidative injury provoke tangle formation with consequent neuronal loss. Cannabidiol (CBD), a Cannabis derivative devoid of psychotropic effects, has attracted much attention because it may beneficially interfere with several Abeta-triggered neurodegenerative pathways, even though the mechanism responsible for such actions remains unknown. In the present research, the role of CBD was investigated as a possible modulating compound of APP processing in SHSY5Y(APP+) neurons. In addition, the putative involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) was explored as a candidate molecular site responsible for CBD actions. Results indicated the CBD capability to induce the ubiquitination of APP protein which led to a substantial decrease in APP full length protein levels in SHSY5Y(APP+) with the consequent decrease in Abeta production. Moreover, CBD promoted an increased survival of SHSY5Y(APP+) neurons, by reducing their long-term apoptotic rate. Obtained results also showed that all, here observed, CBD effects were dependent on the selective activation of PPARgamma.

24291210|t|D-polyglutamine amyloid recruits L-polyglutamine monomers and kills cells.
24291210|a|Polyglutamine (polyQ) amyloid fibrils are observed in disease tissue and have been implicated as toxic agents responsible for neurodegeneration in expanded CAG repeat diseases such as Huntington's disease. Despite intensive efforts, the mechanism of amyloid toxicity remains unknown. As a novel approach to probing polyQ toxicity, we investigate here how some cellular and physical properties of polyQ amyloid vary with the chirality of the glutamine residues in the polyQ. We challenged PC12 cells with small amyloid fibrils composed of either L- or D-polyQ peptides and found that D-fibrils are as cytotoxic as L-fibrils. We also found using fluorescence microscopy that both aggregates effectively seed the aggregation of cell-produced L-polyQ proteins, suggesting a surprising lack of stereochemical restriction in seeded elongation of polyQ amyloid. To investigate this effect further, we studied chemically synthesized D- and L-polyQ in vitro. We found that, as expected, D-polyQ monomers are not recognized by proteins that recognize L-polyQ monomers. However, amyloid fibrils prepared from D-polyQ peptides can efficiently seed the aggregation of L-polyQ monomers in vitro, and vice versa. This result is consistent with our cell results on polyQ recruitment but is inconsistent with previous literature reports on the chiral specificity of amyloid seeding. This chiral cross-seeding can be rationalized by a model for seeded elongation featuring a "rippled beta-sheet" interface between seed fibril and docked monomers of opposite chirality. The lack of chiral discrimination in polyQ amyloid cytotoxicity is consistent with several toxicity mechanisms, including recruitment of cellular polyQ proteins.

24291517|t|Disrupted cross-laminar cortical processing in beta amyloid pathology precedes cell death.
24291517|a|Disruption of neuronal networks in the Alzheimer-afflicted brain is increasingly recognized as a key correlate of cognitive and memory decline in Alzheimer patients. We hypothesized that functional synaptic disconnections within cortical columnar microcircuits by pathological beta-amyloid accumulation, rather than cell death, initially causes the cognitive impairments. During development of cortical beta-amyloidosis with still few plaques in the transgenic 5xFAD mouse model single cell resolution mapping of neuronal thallium uptake revealed that electrical activity of pyramidal cells breaks down throughout infragranular cortical layer V long before cell death occurs. Treatment of 5xFAD mice with the glutaminyl cyclase inhibitor, PQ 529, partially prevented the decline of pyramidal cell activity, indicating pyroglutamate-modified forms, potentially mixed oligomers of Abeta are contributing to neuronal impairment. Laminar investigation of cortical circuit dysfunction with current source density analysis identified an early loss of excitatory synaptic input in infragranular layers, linked to pathological recurrent activations in supragranular layers. This specific disruption of normal cross-laminar cortical processing coincided with a decline of contextual fear learning.

24292856|a|Decoupling conformational changes from aggregation will help us understand amyloids better. Here we attach Alzheimer's amyloid-beta(1-40) monomers to silver nanoparticles, preventing their aggregation, and study their conformation under aggregation-favoring conditions using SERS. Surprisingly, the alpha-helical character of the peptide remains unchanged between pH 10.5 and 5.5, while the solubility changes >100x. Amyloid aggregation can therefore start without significant conformational changes.

24298149|t|Neurotransmitter receptor and time dependence of the synaptic plasticity disrupting actions of Alzheimer's disease Abeta in vivo.
24298149|a|Many endogenous factors influence the time course and extent of the detrimental effects of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) on synaptic function. Here, we assessed the impact of varying endogenous glutamatergic and cholinergic transmission by pharmacological means on the disruption of plasticity at hippocampal CA3-to-CA1 synapses in the anaesthetized rat. NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are considered critical in mediating Abeta-induced inhibition of long-term potentiation (LTP). However, intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta1-42 inhibited not only NMDAR-dependent LTP but also voltage-activated Ca(2+)-dependent LTP induced by strong conditioning stimulation during NMDAR blockade. On the other hand, another form of NMDAR-independent synaptic plasticity, endogenous acetylcholine-induced muscarinic receptor-dependent long-term enhancement, was not hindered by Abeta1-42. Interestingly, augmenting endogenous acetylcholine activation of nicotinic receptors prior to the injection of Abeta1-42 prevented the inhibition of NMDAR-dependent LTP, whereas the same intervention when introduced after the infusion of Abeta was ineffective. We also examined the duration of action of Abeta, including water soluble Abeta from Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. Remarkably, the inhibition of LTP induction caused by a single injection of sodium dodecyl sulfate-stable Abeta dimer-containing AD brain extract persisted for at least a week. These findings highlight the need to increase our understanding of non-NMDAR mechanisms and of developing novel means of overcoming, rather than just preventing, the deleterious synaptic actions of Abeta.

24305500|t|Abeta38 in the brains of patients with sporadic and familial Alzheimer's disease and transgenic mouse models.
24305500|a|The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is believed to be closely dependent on deposits of neurotoxic amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta), which become abundantly present throughout the central nervous system in advanced stages of the disease. The different Abeta peptides existing are generated by subsequent cleavage of the amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) and may vary in length and differ at their C-terminus. Despite extensive studies on the most prevalent species Abeta40 and Abeta42, Abeta peptides with other C-termini such as Abeta38 have not received much attention. In the present study, we used a highly specific and sensitive antibody against Abeta38 to analyze the distribution of this Abeta species in cases of sporadic and familial AD, as well as in the brains of a series of established transgenic AD mouse models. We found Abeta38 to be present as vascular deposits in the brains of the majority of sporadic AD cases, whereas it is largely absent in non-demented control cases. Abeta38-positive extracellular plaques were virtually limited to familial cases. Interestingly we observed Abeta38-positive plaques not only among familial cases due to AbetaPP mutations, but also in cases of familial AD caused by presenilin (PSEN) mutations. Furthermore we demonstrate that Abeta38 deposits in the form of extracellular plaques are common in several AD transgenic mouse models carrying either only AbetaPP, or combinations of AbetaPP, PSEN1, and tau transgenes.

24310721|t|Synthesis and evaluation of (13)N-labelled azo compounds for beta-amyloid imaging in mice.
24310721|a|PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to develop short half-lived tools for in vitro and in vivo beta-amyloid imaging in mice, for which no suitable PET tracers are available. PROCEDURES: Five (13)N-labelled azo compounds (1-5) were synthesized using a three-step process using cyclotron-produced [(13)N]NO3 (-). Biodistribution studies were performed using positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) on 20-month-old healthy, wild-type (WT) mice. In vivo and in vitro binding assays were performed using PET-CT and autoradiography, respectively, on 20-month-old healthy (WT) mice and transgenic (Tg2576) Alzheimer's disease model mice. RESULTS: (13)N-labelled azo compounds were prepared with decay corrected radiochemical yields in the range 27 +- 4 % to 39 +- 4 %. Biodistribution studies showed good blood-brain barrier penetration for compounds 1 and 3-5; good clearance data were also obtained for compounds 1-3 and 5. Compounds 2, 3 and 5 (but not 1) showed a significant uptake in beta-amyloid-rich structures when assayed in in vitro autoradiographic studies. PET studies showed significant uptake of compounds 2 and 3 in the cortex of transgenic animals that exhibit beta-amyloid deposits. CONCLUSIONS: The results underscore the potential of compounds 2 and 3 as in vitro and in vivo markers for beta-amyloid in animal models of Alzheimer's disease.

24313551|t|Quantification of the concentration of Abeta42 propagons during the lag phase by an amyloid chain reaction assay.
24313551|a|The aggregation of the amyloid beta peptide, Abeta42, implicated in Alzheimer's disease, is characterized by a lag phase followed by a rapid growth phase. Conventional methods to study this reaction are not sensitive to events taking place early in the lag phase promoting the assumption that only monomeric or oligomeric species are present at early stages and that the lag time is defined by the primary nucleation rate only. Here we exploit the high sensitivity of chemical chain reactions to the reagent composition to develop an assay which improves by 2 orders of magnitude the detection limit of conventional bulk techniques and allows the concentration of fibrillar Abeta42 propagons to be detected and quantified even during the lag time. The method relies on the chain reaction multiplication of a small number of initial fibrils by secondary nucleation on the fibril surface in the presence of monomeric peptides, allowing the quantification of the number of initial propagons by comparing the multiplication reaction kinetics with controlled seeding data. The quantitative results of the chain reaction assay are confirmed by qualitative transmission electron microscopy analysis. The results demonstrate the nonlinearity of the aggregation process which involves both primary and secondary nucleation events even at the early stages of the reaction during the lag-phase.

24315581|t|Cerebrolysin reduces amyloid-beta deposits, apoptosis and autophagy in the thalamus and improves functional recovery after cortical infarction.
24315581|a|Focal cerebral infarction causes amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposits and secondary thalamic neuronal degeneration. The present study aimed to determine the protective effects of Cerebrolysin on Abeta deposits and secondary neuronal damage in thalamus after cerebral infarction. At 24h after distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), Cerebrolysin (5 ml/kg) or saline as control was once daily administered for consecutive 13 days by intraperitoneal injection. Sensory function and secondary thalamic damage were assessed with adhesive-removal test, Nissl staining and immunofluorescence at 14 days after MCAO. Abeta deposits, activity of beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), apoptosis and autophagy were determined by TUNEL staining, immunofluorescence and immunoblot. The results showed that Cerebrolysin significantly improved sensory deficit compared to controls (p<0.05). Abeta deposits and BACE1 were obviously reduced by Cerebrolysin, which was accompanied by decreases in neuronal loss and astroglial activation compared to controls (all p < 0.05). Coincidently, Cerebrolysin markedly inhibited cleaved caspase-3, conversion of LC3-II, downregulation of Bcl-2 and upregulation of Bax in the ipsilateral thalamus compared to controls (all p<0.05). These findings suggest that Cerebrolysin reduces Abeta deposits, apoptosis and autophagy in the ipsilateral thalamus, which may be associated with amelioration of secondary thalamic damage and functional recovery after cerebral infarction.

24321557|t|Additive genetic effect of APOE and BDNF on hippocampus activity.
24321557|a|Human memory is a highly heritable polygenic trait with complex inheritance patterns. To study the genetics of memory and memory-related diseases, hippocampal functioning has served as an intermediate phenotype. The importance of investigating gene-gene effects on complex phenotypes has been emphasized, but most imaging studies still focus on single polymorphisms. APOE epsilon4 and BDNF Met, two of the most studied gene variants for variability in memory performance and neuropsychiatric disorders, have both separately been related to poorer episodic memory and altered hippocampal functioning. Here, we investigated the combined effect of APOE and BDNF on hippocampal activation (N=151). No non-additive interaction effects were seen. Instead, the results revealed decreased activation in bilateral hippocampus and parahippocampus as a function of the number of APOE epsilon4 and BDNF Met alleles present (neither, one, or both). The combined effect was stronger than either of the individual effects, and both gene variables explained significant proportions of variance in BOLD signal change. Thus, there was an additive gene-gene effect of APOE and BDNF on medial temporal lobe (MTL) activation, showing that a larger proportion of variance in brain activation attributed to genetics can be explained by considering more than one gene variant. This effect might be relevant for the understanding of normal variability in memory function as well as memory-related disorders associated with APOE and BDNF.

24325797|t|Permeability transition pore-mediated mitochondrial superoxide flashes mediate an early inhibitory effect of amyloid beta1-42 on neural progenitor cell proliferation.
24325797|a|Cellular damage by reactive oxygen species and altered neurogenesis are implicated in the etiology of AD and the pathogenic actions of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta); the underlying mechanisms and the early oxidative intracellular events triggered by Abeta are not established. In the present study, we found that mouse embryonic cortical neural progenitor cells exhibit intermittent spontaneous mitochondrial superoxide (SO) flashes that require transient opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores (mPTPs). The incidence of mitochondria SO flash activity in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) increased during the first 6-24 hours of exposure to aggregating amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta1-42), indicating an increase in transient mPTP opening. Subsequently, the SO flash frequency progressively decreased and ceased between 48 and 72 hours of exposure to Abeta1-42, during which time global cellular reactive oxygen species increased, mitochondrial membrane potential decreased, cytochrome C was released from mitochondria and the cells degenerated. Inhibition of mPTPs and selective reduction in mitochondrial SO flashes significantly ameliorated the negative effects of Abeta1-42 on NPC proliferation and survival. Our findings suggest that mPTP-mediated bursts of mitochondrial SO production is a relatively early and pivotal event in the adverse effects of Abeta1-42 on NPCs. If Abeta inhibits NPC proliferation in the brains of AD patients by a similar mechanism, then interventions that inhibit mPTP-mediated superoxide flashes would be expected to protect NPCs against the adverse effects of Abeta.

24330306|t|Amyloid burden correlates with cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease presenting with aphasia.
24330306|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A subset of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) present with early and prominent language deficits. It is unclear whether the burden of underlying beta-amyloid pathology is associated with language or general cognitive impairment in these subjects. METHODS: The relationship between cortical beta-amyloid burden on [(11) C]Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET) and performance on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Wechsler Memory Scale - Third Edition (WMS-III), the Boston Naming Test (BNT) and the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) was assessed using regression and correlation analyses in subjects presenting with aphasia who showed beta-amyloid deposition on PiB PET. RESULTS: The global PiB ratio was inversely correlated with MoCA (P = 0.02) and the WMS-III Visual Reproduction (VR) subtest (VR I, P = 0.02; VR II, P = 0.04). However, the correlations between PiB ratio, BNT (P = 0.13), WAB aphasia quotient (P = 0.11) and WAB repetition scores (P = 0.34) were not significant. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that an increased cortical beta-amyloid burden is associated with cognitive impairment, but not language deficits, in AD subjects presenting with aphasia. The results suggest that beta-amyloid deposition could be partly contributing to impaired cognition in such patients whilst language dysfunction may be more influenced by other pathological mechanisms, perhaps downstream pathways of beta-amyloid deposition.

24331439|t|Imatinib treatment and Abeta42 in humans.
24331439|a|BACKGROUND: The first-line treatment in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), imatinib, has been shown to decrease the production of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in vitro and in animal studies. However, whether imatinib has this effect in humans is not known. METHODS: Plasma levels of Abeta42 were analyzed in sequential samples from CML patients treated with imatinib (n=51). The effect of imatinib on Abeta production was also investigated in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells overexpressing the amyloid precursor protein (APP) with the Swedish mutation, in mouse primary cortical neurons and in human Down syndrome embryonic stem-cell-derived cortical neurons. RESULTS: Twelve months of imatinib treatment did not lower plasma Abeta42 levels in CML patients, and imatinib treatment did not lead to less Abeta42 production in any of the in vitro models whereas beta- and gamma-secretase inhibitors did. CONCLUSION: These data question the previously described role of imatinib in inhibiting amyloidogenic APP processing and as a drug candidate for AD.

To further understand the role of 5LO in AD pathogenesis, we exposed the triple transgenic (3xTg) and 3xTg/5LO knockout mice to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a known inducer of neuroinflammation, and evaluated its effect on their AD-like phenotype. 3xTg mice treated with LPS manifested a worsening of behavior, gamma-secretase up-regulation, and increased neuroinflammatory responses. These effects were completely prevented in 3xTg mice genetically deficient for 5LO. By contrast, the absence of 5LO did not protect against increase in tau phosphorylation at specific epitopes that were mediated by the activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase 5. Our data demonstrate that the 5LO pathway affects key neuropathological features of the AD-like phenotype (behavior, abeta, microgliosis, astrocytosis) but not others (tau pathology) in the LPS-dependent neuroinflammation model. The opposite ways whereby 5LO influences the LPS-dependent effects in vivo supports the complex nature of the neuroinflammatory response in AD and its differential role in modulating amyloid and tau neuropathology.

24333259|t|Absence of amyloid-beta in lenses of Alzheimer patients: a confocal Raman microspectroscopic study.
24333259|a|We have compared the protein profiles in plaques and tangles in the hippocampus of post-mortem Alzheimer brains and in opaque and clear regions in the deep cortex of eye lenses of the same donors. From the 7 Alzheimer donors studied, 1 had pronounced bilateral cortical lens opacities, 1 moderate and 5 only minor or no cortical opacities. We focused on beta-sheet levels, a hallmarking property of amyloid-beta, the major protein of plaques and tau protein, the major protein of tangles in Alzheimer brains. Confocal Raman microspectroscopy and imaging was used in combination with hierarchical cluster analysis. Plaques and tangles show high levels of beta-sheets with a beta-sheet to protein ratio of 1.67. This ratio is 1.12 in unaffected brain tissue surrounding the plaques and tangles. In the lenses this ratio is 1.17 independently of the presence or absence of opacities. This major difference in beta-sheet conformation between hippocampus and lens is supported by Congo red and immunostaining of amyloid-beta and tau which were positive for plaques and tangles in the hippocampus but fully negative for the lens irrespective of the presence or absence of opacities. In line with a previous study (Michael et al., 2013) we conclude that cortical lens opacities are not typical for Alzheimer patients and are not hallmarked by accumulation of amyloid-beta, and can thus not be considered as predictors or indicators of Alzheimer disease as claimed by Goldstein et al. (2003).

24333591|t|Liposomes bi-functionalized with phosphatidic acid and an ApoE-derived peptide affect Abeta aggregation features and cross the blood-brain-barrier: implications for therapy of Alzheimer disease.
24333591|a|Targeting amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) within the brain is a strategy actively sought for therapy of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated the ability of liposomes bi-functionalized with phosphatidic acid and with a modified ApoE-derived peptide (mApoE-PA-LIP) to affect Abeta aggregation/disaggregation features and to cross in vitro and in vivo the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Surface plasmon resonance showed that bi-functionalized liposomes strongly bind Abeta (kD=0.6 muM), while Thioflavin-T and SDS-PAGE/WB assays show that liposomes inhibit peptide aggregation (70% inhibition after 72 h) and trigger the disaggregation of preformed aggregates (60% decrease after 120 h incubation). Moreover, experiments with dually radiolabelled LIP suggest that bi-functionalization enhances the passage of radioactivity across the BBB either in vitro (permeability=2.5x10(-5) cm/min, 5-fold higher with respect to mono-functionalized liposomes) or in vivo in healthy mice. Taken together, our results suggest that mApoE-PA-LIP are valuable nanodevices with a potential applicability in vivo for the treatment of AD. From the clinical editor: Bi-functionalized liposomes with phosphatidic acid and a modified ApoE-derived peptide were demonstrated to influence Abeta aggregation/disaggregation as a potential treatment in an Alzheimer's model. The liposomes were able to cross the blood-brain barrier in vitro and in vivo. Similar liposomes may become clinically valuable nanodevices with a potential applicability for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

24333930|t|Activated protein C inhibits amyloid beta production via promoting expression of ADAM-10.
24333930|a|Inhibition of Abeta production and clearance of senile plaques have been considered as potential strategies in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Activated protein C (APC) is an important factor in the anticoagulant system. However, whether APC can influence the condition of a chronic neurodegenerative process, such as that present in AD, is unknown. In this study, we found that administration of APC on AD Tg2576 mice significantly reduced amyloid beta production and helped to facilitate cognitive improvement. APC could also reduce levels of Abeta40 and Abeta42 produced in APPswe cells, an AD cell model. Further results demonstrated that APC did not change the levels of Abeta-degrading enzymes, insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), or neprilysin (NEP). Next, we found that APC promoted sAPPalpha and CTFalpha release and inhibited sAPPbeta and CTFbeta release, thereby indicating that APC could regulate Abeta secretion by shifting APP processing from the amyloidogenic pathway toward the nonamyloidogenic pathway. Correspondingly, further study revealed that ADAM-10 expression was increased by APC, suggesting that APC inhibits Abeta secretion through stimulating activity of alpha-secretase. These findings support the idea that APC could hold therapeutic potential in the treatment of AD.

24334723|t|Plasma amyloid-beta levels are significantly associated with a transition toward Alzheimer's disease as measured by cognitive decline and change in neocortical amyloid burden.
24334723|a|BACKGROUND: We evaluated the utility of longitudinal measures of plasma amyloid-beta (Abeta) as a means to identify pre-symptomatic cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) when coupled to neuroimaging and neuropsychological parameters. METHODS: Participants from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study were grouped based upon cognitive change and changes in measurable levels of neocortical amyloid over 36 months. Participants were classified as those who transitioned for cognitive decline and change in neocortical amyloid, those healthy controls that did not transition, and stable AD participants over 36 months. RESULTS: Comparisons of plasma Abeta levels between the transition and non-transitional groups showed Abeta1-42 and the Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 ratio were significantly decreased at baseline (p = 0.008 and p = 0.002, respectively) and at 18 months (p = 0.003 and p = 0.004, respectively). Both measures of neocortical amyloid and two previously published composite scores validated the creation of the novel transitional grouping (p < 0.0001). In addition Abetan-42 performed well as a longitudinal prognostic indicator of transition toward cognitive decline, with a significant decrease in the transition group at the 18 month time point (p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that baseline plasma Abeta1-42 and the Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 ratio were putative biomarkers indicative of cognitive decline and validated this result using 18 month data. We created a novel transitional grouping and validated this measure using published measures of neocortical amyloid and composite memory scores. These findings suggest that longitudinal plasma Abeta could contribute to a pre-symptomatic biomarker panel for AD.

24335160|t|Taking advantage of physiological proteolytic processing of the prion protein for a therapeutic perspective in prion and Alzheimer diseases.
24335160|a|Prion and Alzheimer diseases are fatal neurodegenerative diseases caused by misfolding and aggregation of the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) and the beta-amyloid peptide, respectively. Soluble oligomeric species rather than large aggregates are now believed to be neurotoxic. PrP(C) undergoes three proteolytic cleavages as part of its natural life cycle, alpha-cleavage, beta-cleavage, and ectodomain shedding. Recent evidences demonstrate that the resulting secreted PrP(C) molecules might represent natural inhibitors against soluble toxic species. In this mini-review, we summarize recent observations suggesting the potential benefit of using PrP(C)-derived molecules as therapeutic agents in prion and Alzheimer diseases.

24335416|t|Amyloid-beta increases metallo- and cysteine protease activities in human macrophages.
24335416|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Amyloid-beta (Abeta) plays a crucial role in the onset and progression of atherosclerosis. Macrophages are a source of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), cysteine proteases and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 in the vascular wall. The aims of this study were to analyze the capacity of Abeta peptide (1-40) (Abeta40), Abeta peptide (1-42) (Abeta42) and fibrillar Abeta42 (fAbeta42) to modulate the expression and activity of MMP-9, MMP-2 and tissue inhibitor of MMP-1 (TIMP-1) in human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM). Additionally, we analyzed whether Abeta internalization alters the secretion of cathepsin S (CatS) and TGF-beta1 by macrophages. METHODS: HMDM were exposed to native and fibrillar Abeta. MMPs and TIMP-1 expression was analyzed by real-time PCR, and MMP abundance by zymography. Protein levels of precursor and active forms of CatS were analyzed by Western blot and TGF-beta1 levels by ELISA. RESULTS: Abeta40, Abeta42 and especially fAbeta42 strongly induced MMP-9/MMP-2 levels. Moreover, we showed enhanced active CatS and reduced TGF-beta1 protein levels in the secretome of Abeta42 and fAbeta42-exposed macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: Abeta can regulate the proinflammatory state of human macrophages by inducing metallo- and cysteine protease levels and by reducing TGF-beta1 secretion. These effects may be crucial in atherosclerosis progression.

24335535|t|Neuropathologic heterogeneity does not impair florbetapir-positron emission tomography postmortem correlates.
24335535|a|Neuropathologic heterogeneity is often present among Alzheimer disease (AD) patients. We sought to determine whether amyloid imaging measures of AD are affected by concurrent pathologies. Thirty-eight clinically and pathologically defined AD and 17 nondemented patients with quantitative florbetapir F-18 (F-AV-45) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging during life and postmortem histological beta-amyloid quantification and neuropathologic examination were assessed. AD patients were divided on the basis of concurrent pathologies, including those with Lewy bodies (LBs) (n = 21), white matter rarefaction (n = 27), severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy (n = 11), argyrophilic grains (n = 5), and TAR DNA binding protein-43 inclusions (n = 18). Many patients exhibited more than 1 type of concurrent pathology. The ratio of cortical to cerebellar amyloid imaging signal (SUVr) and immunohistochemical beta-amyloid load were analyzed in 6 cortical regions of interest. All AD subgroups had strong and significant correlations between SUVr and histological beta-amyloid measures (p mu 0.001). All AD subgroups had significantly greater amyloid measures versus nondemented patients, and mean amyloid measures did not significantly differ between AD subgroups. When comparing AD cases with and without each pathology, AD cases with LBs had significantly lower SUVr measures versus AD cases without LBs (p = 0.002); there were no other paired comparison differences. These findings indicate that florbetapir-PET imaging is not confounded by neuropathological heterogeneity within AD.

24336048|t|Microglia convert aggregated amyloid-beta into neurotoxic forms through the shedding of microvesicles.
24336048|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition, which activates microglia, induces neuroinflammation and drives neurodegeneration. Recent evidence indicates that soluble pre-fibrillar Abeta species, rather than insoluble fibrils, are the most toxic forms of Abeta. Preventing soluble Abeta formation represents, therefore, a major goal in AD. We investigated whether microvesicles (MVs) released extracellularly by reactive microglia may contribute to AD degeneration. We found that production of myeloid MVs, likely of microglial origin, is strikingly high in AD patients and in subjects with mild cognitive impairment and that AD MVs are toxic for cultured neurons. The mechanism responsible for MV neurotoxicity was defined in vitro using MVs produced by primary microglia. We demonstrated that neurotoxicity of MVs results from (i) the capability of MV lipids to promote formation of soluble Abeta species from extracellular insoluble aggregates and (ii) from the presence of neurotoxic Abeta forms trafficked to MVs after Abeta internalization into microglia. MV neurotoxicity was neutralized by the Abeta-interacting protein PrP and anti-Abeta antibodies, which prevented binding to neurons of neurotoxic soluble Abeta species. This study identifies microglia-derived MVs as a novel mechanism by which microglia participate in AD degeneration, and suggest new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of the disease.

24338754|t|Tetrapeptidic molecular hydrogels: self-assembly and co-aggregation with amyloid fragment Abeta1-40.
24338754|a|A new family of isomeric tetrapeptides containing aromatic and polar amino acid residues that are able to form molecular hydrogels following a smooth change in pH is described. The hydrogels have been studied by spectroscopic and microscopic techniques showing that the peptide primary sequence has an enormous influence on the self-assembly process. In particular, the formation of extended hydrophobic regions and the appearance of pi-stacking interactions have been revealed as the driving forces for aggregation. Moreover, the interaction of these compounds with amyloid peptidic fragment Abeta1-40 has been studied and some of them have been shown to act as templates for the aggregation of this peptide into non-beta-sheet fibrillar structures. These compounds could potentially be used for the capture of toxic, soluble amyloid oligomers. 

24339192|t|Difluorophenylglycinols as new modulators of proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor proteins.
24339192|a|Synthesis and evaluation of difluorophenylglycinols as new modulators of proteolytic processing of the amyloid-beta precursor proteins for Alzheimer's therapies were described. A range of N-substituted (R)- and (S)-difluorophenylglycinols, structured on the amino alcohol framework, were explored by incorporating the arylsulfonyl moieties and various N-substituents. Evans' chiral auxiliary strategy was employed for the asymmetric synthesis of these enantiomeric difluorophenylglycinols. Compounds with effects on the gamma-secretase inhibition and ERK-mediated signaling pathways were evaluated on cell-based assays. Among them, N-cyclopropylmethyl derivatives R-12c and R-13c showed modest gamma-secretase inhibition as well as ERK-dependent activation.

24342238|t|Design, synthesis and anti-Alzheimer properties of dimethylaminomethyl-substituted curcumin derivatives.
24342238|a|Eight dimethylaminomethyl-substituted curcumin derivatives were designed and synthesized. The antioxidant test revealed that the synthesized compounds had higher free radical scavenging activity towards both 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radicals (DPPH) (IC50 1.5-29.9muM) and galvinoxyl radicals (IC50 4.9-41.1muM) than the lead compound curcumin. Besides, compound 3a could effectively inhibit the Abeta self-aggregation in vitro. Investigated in phosphate-buffered solutions (pH=7.4) in the presence or absence of 0.1% FBS 3a showed a good stability while curcumin did not. Furthermore, 3a showed a good lipophilicity (logP=3.48), suggesting a potential ability to penetrate the blood-brain-barrier. The aqueous solubility of the hydrochloride salt of 3a (16.7mg/mL) has also been significantly improved as compared with curcumin (<0.1mg/mL).

24343520|t|Choroid plexus implants rescue Alzheimer's disease-like pathologies by modulating amyloid-beta degradation.
24343520|a|The choroid plexuses (CP) release numerous biologically active enzymes and neurotrophic factors, and contain a subpopulation of neural progenitor cells providing the capacity to proliferate and differentiate into other types of cells. These characteristics make CP epithelial cells (CPECs) excellent candidates for cell therapy aiming at restoring brain tissue in neurodegenerative illnesses, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, using in vitro approaches, we demonstrated that CP were able to diminish amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels in cell cultures, reducing Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. For in vivo studies, CPECs were transplanted into the brain of the APP/PS1 murine model of AD that exhibits advanced Abeta accumulation and memory impairment. Brain examination after cell implantation revealed a significant reduction in brain Abeta deposits, hyperphosphorylation of tau, and astrocytic reactivity. Remarkably, the transplantation of CPECs was accompanied by a total behavioral recovery in APP/PS1 mice, improving spatial and non-spatial memory. These findings reinforce the neuroprotective potential of CPECs and the use of cell therapies as useful tools in AD.

24345484|t|Puerarin alleviates cognitive impairment and oxidative stress in APP/PS1 transgenic mice.
24345484|a|Increasing evidence demonstrates that beta-amyloid (Abeta) elicits oxidative stress, which contributes to the pathogenesis and disease progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, there is interest in developing antioxidant therapies for the prevention/treatment of cognitive decline during AD. We reported previously that puerarin has antioxidative properties in vitro. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine whether puerarin improves cognitive function and reduces oxidative stress in amyloid precursor protein/presenilin-1 (APP/PS1) mice, a well established AD mouse model, and explore its potential mechanism. Our results show that oral administration of puerarin significantly ameliorates cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 mice assessed by the Morris water maze (MWM) test. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in the levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO) through, at least in part, induction of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) target gene heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 transgenic mice at 9 months of age, but without altering brain Abeta burden. Furthermore, puerarin significantly activated Akt, reduced activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta), and induced nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice but did not alter ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Thus, puerarin may improve cognitive performance in APP/PS1 mice through activation of the Akt/GSK-3beta signaling pathway. These findings suggest that puerarin might be an attractive agent for prevention and treatment of cognitive impairment and dementia.

24346216|t|Activation of neuronal defense mechanisms in response to pathogenic factors triggering induction of amyloidosis in Alzheimer's disease.
24346216|a|We present a new model for etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) which postulates early involvement of specialized neuroprotective mechanisms in the pathology of AD. These neuroprotective mechanisms work in concert to regulate metabolic homeostasis in healthy neuronal cells, but contribute to the distinctive cytopathic phenotype of neuronal degeneration in AD. According to this model, two molecular/genetic hallmarks of AD, amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation, are associated with neuronal mechanisms for dissipating thermal energy associated with high levels of protein synthesis in highly temperature-sensitive neuronal cells. Development of effective methods of AD treatment will require a better understanding of how this neuronal defense system is activated in response to cytopathological triggers in sporadic AD. The cause and effect link between synthesis and processing of amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) and the AD terminal phenotype of neurofibrillary tangles and neuron loss involve the formation of Abeta peptides that accumulate as oligomers, cannot be controlled by neurons, and are toxic to the surrounding neuronal membranes. We analyze experimental and clinical studies that have investigated the correlation between phosphorylation of some transport proteins and increased synthesis of proteins in neurons. We also review the evidence related to the possibility that protein hyperphosphorylation may be a byproduct of energetic imbalances in AD cells associated with high levels of protein synthesis, and that activation of defense systems, through which energy-rich molecules are eliminated from the site of protein synthesis and are sequestered to the peripheral neuronal areas, may bring about some of the distinctive morphological features of AD.

24346217|t|Stimulation of insulin signaling and inhibition of JNK-AP1 activation protect cells from amyloid-beta-induced signaling dysregulation and inflammatory response.
24346217|a|One of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the accumulation and deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides in the brain and cerebral vasculature. Abeta evokes neuroinflammation and has been implicated in insulin signaling disruption and JNK-AP1 activation, contributing to AD neuropathologies including oxidative injury and vascular insufficiencies. In this study we aim to better understand the protective mechanisms of insulin signaling and JNK-AP1 inhibition on the adverse effects of Abeta. Four-hour treatment of hCMEC/D3, the immortalized human brain endothelial cells (iHBEC), with Abeta1-42 resulted in significant c-Jun phosphorylation, oxidative stress, and cell toxicity. Concurrent treatment with Abeta1-42 and insulin or Abeta1-42 and JNK inhibitor SP600125 significantly improved cell viability. Cytokine array on conditioned media showed that insulin and SP600125 strongly reduced all Abeta1-42-induced cytokines. ELISA confirmed the protective effect of insulin and SP600125 on Abeta-induced expression of interleukin (IL)-8 and Growth related oncogene-alpha (Gro-alpha). qRT-PCR revealed that insulin and SP600125 protected iHBEC from Abeta1-42-induced inflammatory gene expression. Transcription factor profiling showed that treatment of iHBEC with Abeta1-42, insulin, or SP600125 alone or in combination resulted in profound changes in modulating the activities of multiple transcription factors and relevant pathways, some of which were validated by western blot. Insulin treatment and JNK inhibition in vitro synergistically reduced c-Jun phosphorylation and thus JNK-AP1 signaling activation. The study suggests that activation of insulin and blocking of JNK-AP1 signaling inhibits Abeta-induced dysregulation of insulin signaling and inflammatory response.

24346258|t|The effects of dietary restriction and aging on amyloid precursor protein and presenilin-1 mRNA and protein expression in rat brain.
24346258|a|The objective of this study was to examine the effects of aging and long-term dietary restriction (DR) on the level of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin-1 (PS-1), proteins that are critically involved in Alzheimer's disease. Changes in mRNA and protein expression were assessed by real-time PCR and western blot analysis during aging and long-term DR in the cortex and hippocampus of 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-month-old rats. Prominent regional changes in expression were observed in response to aging and DR. Although the hippocampus displayed significant alterations in APP mRNA and protein expression and no significant changes in PS-1 expression, an opposite pattern was observed in the cortex. DR counteracted the age-related changes in APP mRNA expression in both structures of old animals. The observed DR-induced increase in mRNA levels in the hippocampus was accompanied by an increase in the level of full-length protein APP. These results indicate that although both structures are very sensitive to aging, a specific spatial pattern of changes in APP and PS-1 occurs during aging. Furthermore, these findings provide evidence that DR can affect APP and PS-1 expression in a manner consistent with its proposed 'antiaging' effect.

24347181|t|Genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in an APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
24347181|a|To investigate aberrant genome-wide CpG methylation patterns in cortex brain tissue of APP/PS1 mice and as compared to controls, which allows for identification of novel disease-associated genes. This study investigates the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of the cortex from APP/PS1 transgenic mice and control mice using the Roche NimbleGen chip platform. Functional analysis was then conducted by Ingenuity Pathways Analysis system. The methylated DNA fragments in the genome of each sample were enriched by MeDIP and the whole-genome interrogations were hybridized to the Roche NimbleGen Human DNA Methylation 3x720 K CpG Island Plus RefSeq Promoter Array that cover 15,980 CpG islands and 20,404 reference gene promoter regions of the entire human genome. Analysis reveals 2346 CpG sites representing 485 unique genes as potentially associated with AD disease status pending confirmation in additional study. At the same time, these hyper-methylated genes display familial aggregation. An impairment of the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) signaling pathway has been demonstrated to be specific to the AD brain and, particularly, to the early phase of the disease, supporting a role for epigenetic change of TGF-beta1 in AD pathology. In future research, we will focus on TGF-beta1, as it appeared to be the most promising candidate for AD.

24359497|t|Selective acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors reduce amyloid-beta ex vivo activation of peripheral chemo-cytokines from Alzheimer's disease subjects: exploring the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway.
24359497|a|Increasing evidence suggests that elevated production and/or reduced clearance of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) drives the early pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta soluble oligomers trigger a neurotoxic cascade that leads to neuronal dysfunction, neurodegeneration and, ultimately, clinical dementia. Inflammation, both within brain and systemically, together with a deficiency in the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) that underpinned the development of anticholinesterases for AD symptomatic treatment, are invariable hallmarks of the disease. The inter-relation between Abeta, inflammation and cholinergic signaling is complex, with each feeding back onto the others to drive disease progression. To elucidate these interactions plasma samples and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were evaluated from healthy controls (HC) and AD patients. Plasma levels of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) and Abeta were significantly elevated in AD vs. HC subjects, and ACh showed a trend towards reduced levels. Abeta challenge of PBMCs induced a greater release of inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) from AD vs. HC subjects, with IL-10 being similarly affected. THP-1 monocytic cells, a cell culture counterpart of PBMCs and brain microglial cells, responded similarly to Abeta as well as to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) challenge, to allow preliminary analysis of the cellular and molecular pathways underpinning Abeta-induced changes in cytokine expression. As amyloid-beta precursor protein expression, and hence Abeta, has been reported regulated by particular cytokines and anticholinesterases, the latter were evaluated on Abeta- and PHA-induced chemocytokine expression. Co-incubation with selective AChE/BuChE inhibitors, (-)-phenserine (AChE) and (-)-cymserine analogues (BuChE), mitigated the rise in cytokine levels and suggest that augmentation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway may prove valuable in AD.

24361736|t|Proliferation, differentiation and amyloid-beta production in neural progenitor cells isolated from TgCRND8 mice.
24361736|a|The amyloid precursor protein (APP) and amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide play central roles in the pathology and etiology of Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid-induced impairments in neurogenesis have been investigated in several transgenic mouse models but the mechanism of action remains to be conclusively demonstrated. The changes in neurogenesis during this transition of increasing Abeta levels and plaque formation were investigated in the present study. We found that the proliferation of newborn cell in the dentate gyrus was enhanced prior to elevations in soluble Abeta production as well as amyloid deposition in 5-week-old TgCRND8 mice, which are well-established Alzheimer's disease models, compared to non-transgenic (Non-Tg) mice. The number of BrdU-positive cells remained higher in TgCRND8 vs Non-Tg mice for a period of 8weeks. The numbers of BrdU/NeuN-positive cells were not significantly different in TgCRND8 compared to Non-Tg mice. A significant decrease in BrdU/GFAP but not in BrdU/S100beta was found in Tg vs Non-Tg at 6-weeks of age. In addition, a unique observation was made using isolated neuroprogenitor cells from TgCRND8 mice which were found to be less viable in culture and produced substantial amounts of secreted Abeta peptides. This suggests that the proliferation of neural progenitors in vivo may be modulated by high levels of APP expression and the resulting Abeta generated directly by the progenitor cells. These findings indicate that cell proliferation is increased prior to Abeta deposition and that cell viability is decreased in TgCRND8 mice over time.

24361992|t|Asynchronous evolutionary origins of Abeta and BACE1.
24361992|a|Neurodegenerative plaques characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are composed of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide, which is proteolyzed from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-secretase (beta-site APP cleaving enzyme [BACE1]) and gamma-secretase. Although gamma-secretase has essential functions across metazoans, no essential roles have been identified for BACE1 or Abeta. Because their only known function results in a disease phenotype, we sought to understand these components from an evolutionary perspective. We show that APP-like proteins are found throughout most animal taxa, but sequences homologous to Abeta are not found outside gnathostomes and the beta cut site is only conserved within sarcopterygians. BACE1 enzymes, however, extend through basal chordates and as far as cnidaria. We then sought to determine whether BACE1 from a species that never evolved Abeta could proteolyze APP substrates that include Abeta. We demonstrate that BACE1 from a basal chordate is a functional ortholog that can liberate Abeta from full-length human APP, indicating BACE1 activity evolved at least 360 My before Abeta.

24362678|a|Transgenic mouse has shown great advantages in the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and drug screening as AD develops rapidly resent years, while more detail information of these transgenic mice and experience of application are needed. To obtain the basic background information of the B6C3-Tg (APPswe/PSEN1dE9) double-transgenic mouse, which was reported with early onset AD, three- to ten-month-old B6C3-Tg AD mice and normal C57BL/6 mice were selected randomly to test the ability of learning memory by Morris water maze, the brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity by AChE kit, and beta amyloid protein level by immunohistochemistry staining. Compared with the control group, the escape latency time of B6C3-Tg AD mice at 9 and 10 months of age is significantly longer (P < 0.05) in Morris maze test, and the activity of brain AChE is higher. beta-Amyloid plaques were observed at 3 months of age and developed rapidly. Statistical analysis showed a positive correlation between the area of these plaques and the ages of B6C3-Tg AD mouse (y = 0.0355e(0.5557x), R = 0.9557). The model's behavior is conformed to simulate behaviors of human Alzheimer's disease at the early stage and may provide detail background information a new choice when transgenic mice are needed in the research of AD.

24362760|t|Molecular drivers and cortical spread of lateral entorhinal cortex dysfunction in preclinical Alzheimer's disease.
24362760|a|The entorhinal cortex has been implicated in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, which is characterized by changes in the tau protein and in the cleaved fragments of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). We used a high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) variant that can map metabolic defects in patients and mouse models to address basic questions about entorhinal cortex pathophysiology. The entorhinal cortex is divided into functionally distinct regions, the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC), and we exploited the high-resolution capabilities of the fMRI variant to ask whether either of them was affected in patients with preclinical Alzheimer's disease. Next, we imaged three mouse models of disease to clarify how tau and APP relate to entorhinal cortex dysfunction and to determine whether the entorhinal cortex can act as a source of dysfunction observed in other cortical areas. We found that the LEC was affected in preclinical disease, that LEC dysfunction could spread to the parietal cortex during preclinical disease and that APP expression potentiated tau toxicity in driving LEC dysfunction, thereby helping to explain regional vulnerability in the disease.

24363091|t|The proteasome function reporter GFPu accumulates in young brains of the APPswe/PS1dE9 Alzheimer's disease mouse model.
24363091|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, is neuropathologically characterized by accumulation of insoluble fibrous inclusions in the brain in the form of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular senile plaques. Perturbation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) has long been considered an attractive hypothesis to explain the pathogenesis of AD. However, studies on UPS functionality with various methods and AD models have achieved non-conclusive results. To get further insight into UPS functionality in AD, we have crossed a well-documented APPswe/PS1dE9 AD mouse model with a UPS functionality reporter, GFPu, mouse expressing green fluorescence protein (GFP) fused to a constitutive degradation signal (CL-1) that facilitates its rapid turnover in conditions of a normal UPS. Our western blot results indicate that GFPu reporter protein was accumulated in the cortex and hippocampus, but not striatum in the APPswe/PS1dE9 AD mouse model at 4 weeks of age, which is confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and elevated levels of p53, an endogenous UPS substrate. In accordance with this, the levels of ubiquitinated proteins were elevated in the AD mouse model. These results suggest that UPS is either impaired or functionally insufficient in specific brain regions in the APPswe/PS1dE9 AD mouse model at a very young age, long before senile plaque formation and the onset of memory loss. These observations may shed new light on the pathogenesis of AD.

24364734|t|Transmembrane fragment structures of amyloid precursor protein depend on membrane surface curvature.
24364734|a|The amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide associated with Alzheimer's disease results from processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by secretases. Cleavage of APP by beta-secretase produces a 99 amino acid C-terminal fragment of APP (C99) consisting of a single transmembrane (TM) helix. Simulations of C99 congeners and structural studies of C99 in surfactant micelles and lipid vesicles have shown that a key peptide structural motif is a prominent "GG kink," centered at two glycines dividing the TM helix. The flexibility of the GG kink is important in the processing of C99 by gamma-secretase. We performed multiscale simulations of C99(15-55) in a DPC surfactant micelle and POPC lipid bilayer in order to elucidate the role of membrane surface curvature in modulating the peptide structure. C99(15-55) in a DPC surfactant micelle possesses a "GG kink," in the TM domain near the dynamic hinge located at G37/G38. Such a kink is not observed in C99(15-55) in a POPC lipid bilayer. Intramolecular interaction between the extracellular and TM domains of C99(15-55) is enhanced in the micelle environment, influencing helical stability, TM helix extension, exposure to water, and depth of insertion in the lipophilic region. Our results show that the fluctuations of the structural ensemble of APP are strongly influenced by membrane surface curvature.

24368217|t|APOE modulates the effect of estrogen therapy on Abeta accumulation EFAD-Tg mice.
24368217|a|The post-menopausal loss of estrogen is key in the increased incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in women. However, estrogen therapy (ET) clinical trials have produced conflicting results. The APOE gene of apolipoprotein E (apoE) likely modulates the effects of ET in AD. APOE4 is the greatest genetic risk factor for AD, increasing risk up to 15-fold compared with APOE3, and the negative effect of APOE4 on AD risk and neuropathology is greater in women than men. The interactive effects of APOE and ET may converge on modulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels, as independently both the loss of estrogen and APOE4 increases Abeta accumulation. Thus, in this study, 3-month old female EFAD mice (5XFAD mice crossed with apoE-targeted replacement mice), which express increased levels of Abeta42 and human APOE were ovariectomized and treated for 3 months with either 17-beta estradiol (OVX(ET+), 0.25mg total) or vehicle control (OVX(ET-)) and the effects on Abeta accumulation were determined. Compared to the OVX(ET-) cohort, in the OVX(ET+) cohort, extracellular amyloid and Abeta deposition in the hippocampus and cortex were decreased with APOE2 and APOE3, but were increased with APOE4 by IHC. Biochemical analysis demonstrated increased total and insoluble Abeta levels with APOE4, and decreased soluble Abeta42 levels with both APOE3 and APOE4, after ET. These data suggest that ET administered at menopause may benefit APOE4 negative women by decreasing extracellular and soluble Abeta42. However, for APOE4 carriers, the efficacy of ET will be dependent on the relative impact of extracellular and soluble Abeta on AD-induced neurodegeneration.

24368848|t|Neurofibrillary tangle-bearing neurons are functionally integrated in cortical circuits in vivo.
24368848|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is pathologically characterized by the deposition of extracellular amyloid-beta plaques and intracellular aggregation of tau protein in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) (1, 2). Progression of NFT pathology is closely correlated with both increased neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in AD (3) and other tauopathies, such as frontotemporal dementia (4, 5). The assumption that mislocalization of tau into the somatodendritic compartment (6) and accumulation of fibrillar aggregates in NFTs mediates neurodegeneration underlies most current therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing NFT formation or disrupting existing NFTs (7, 8). Although several disease-associated mutations cause both aggregation of tau and neurodegeneration, whether NFTs per se contribute to neuronal and network dysfunction in vivo is unknown (9). Here we used awake in vivo two-photon calcium imaging to monitor neuronal function in adult rTg4510 mice that overexpress a human mutant form of tau (P301L) and develop cortical NFTs by the age of 7-8 mo (10). Unexpectedly, NFT-bearing neurons in the visual cortex appeared to be completely functionally intact, to be capable of integrating dendritic inputs and effectively encoding orientation and direction selectivity, and to have a stable baseline resting calcium level. These results suggest a reevaluation of the common assumption that insoluble tau aggregates are sufficient to disrupt neuronal function.

24371799|t|Integration and relative value of biomarkers for prediction of MCI to AD progression: spatial patterns of brain atrophy, cognitive scores, APOE genotype and CSF biomarkers.
24371799|a|This study evaluates the individual, as well as relative and joint value of indices obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) patterns of brain atrophy (quantified by the SPARE-AD index), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, APOE genotype, and cognitive performance (ADAS-Cog) in progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) within a variable follow-up period up to 6 years, using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative-1 (ADNI-1). SPARE-AD was first established as a highly sensitive and specific MRI-marker of AD vs. cognitively normal (CN) subjects (AUC = 0.98). Baseline predictive values of all aforementioned indices were then compared using survival analysis on 381 MCI subjects. SPARE-AD and ADAS-Cog were found to have similar predictive value, and their combination was significantly better than their individual performance. APOE genotype did not significantly improve prediction, although the combination of SPARE-AD, ADAS-Cog and APOE epsilon4 provided the highest hazard ratio estimates of 17.8 (last vs. first quartile). In a subset of 192 MCI patients who also had CSF biomarkers, the addition of Abeta1-42, t-tau, and p-tau181p to the previous model did not improve predictive value significantly over SPARE-AD and ADAS-Cog combined. Importantly, in amyloid-negative patients with MCI, SPARE-AD had high predictive power of clinical progression. Our findings suggest that SPARE-AD and ADAS-Cog in combination offer the highest predictive power of conversion from MCI to AD, which is improved, albeit not significantly, by APOE genotype. The finding that SPARE-AD in amyloid-negative MCI patients was predictive of clinical progression is not expected under the amyloid hypothesis and merits further investigation.

24372615|t|Familial Alzheimer A2 V mutation reduces the intrinsic disorder and completely changes the free energy landscape of the Abeta1-28 monomer.
24372615|a|The self-assembly of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide of 39-43 amino acids into senile plaques is one hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. While A2 V carriers remain healthy in the heterozygous state, they suffer from early onset AD in the homozygous state. As a first toward understanding the impact of A2 V on Abeta at its earlier stage, we characterized the equilibrium ensemble of the Abeta1-28 wild type and Abeta1-28 A2 V monomers by means of extensive atomistic replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations. While global conformational properties such as the radius of gyration and the average secondary structure content of the whole peptides are very similar, the population of beta-hairpins is increased by a factor of 4 in A2 V, and this may explain the enhanced Abeta1-40 A2 V aggregation kinetics with respect to Abeta1-40 wild type. Both peptides display a non-negligible population of extended metastable conformations differing however in their atomic details that represent ideal seeds for polymerization. Remarkably, upon A2 V mutation, the intrinsic disorder of Abeta1-28 monomer is reduced by a factor of 2, and the free energy landscape is completely different. This difference in the conformational ensembles of the two peptides may explain in part why the mixture of the Abeta40 WT and A2 V peptides protects against AD.

24374010|t|Preliminary studies on trigonelline as potential anti-Alzheimer disease agent: determination by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography and modeling of interactions with beta-amyloid.
24374010|a|For trigonelline, a quaternary-base pyridine alkaloid of presumed Alzheimer's disease-preventing activity, a method of determination has been proposed, based on the hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC). That method might be applied to study the agent's bioavailability, in particular its permeation through blood-brain barrier, which is an inevitable property for the potential central nervous system affecting drugs. Providing that trigonelline possesses the requested pharmacokinetic properties, once attaining pharmacodynamic phase it must interact effectively with the relevant molecular site in the brain, which is characteristic to neurodegenerative diseases, namely the beta-amyloid peptide. Here it was demonstrated by molecular modeling that affinity of trigonelline to the Abeta(1-42) peptide is high and similar to that of an anti-Alzheimer's disease drug candidate - cotinine.

24379109|t|1,8-cineole (eucalyptol) mitigates inflammation in amyloid Beta toxicated PC12 cells: relevance to Alzheimer's disease.
24379109|a|Inflammatory process has a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and insoluble amyloid beta deposits and neurofibrillary tangles provide the obvious stimuli for inflammation. The present study demonstrate the effect of pretreatment of 1,8-cineole (Cin) on inflammation induced by Abeta(25-35) in differentiated PC12 cells. The cells were treated with Cin at different doses for 24 h and then replaced by media containing Abeta(25-35) for another 24 h. The cell viability was decreased in Abeta(25-35) treated cells which was significantly restored by Cin pretreatment. Cin successfully reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential, ROS and NO levels in Abeta(25-35) treated cells. Cin also lowered the levels of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 in Abeta(25-35) treated cells. Moreover, Cin also succeeded in lowering the expression of NOS-2, COX-2 and NF-kappaB. This study suggests the protective effects of Cin on inflammation and provides additional evidence for its potential beneficial use in therapy as an anti-inflammatory agent in neurodegenerative disease.

24390566|t|Electroacupuncture attenuates reference memory impairment associated with astrocytic NDRG2 suppression in APP/PS1 transgenic mice.
24390566|a|Electroacupuncture (EA) has demonstrated therapeutic potential for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A previous study reported that N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) was upregulated in the brain of patients with AD. In the present study, we investigated the effects of repeated EA administration on reference memory impairment and the role of NDRG2 in an amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin-1 (PS1) double transgenic mouse model. Age-matched wild-type and transgenic mice were treated with EA (once per day for 30 min) for 4 weeks (four courses of 5 days EA administration and 2 days rest) beginning at 10 months of age. At seven and ten postnatal months of age and following a 4-week EA treatment regime, mice received training in the Morris water maze (MWM) and a probe test. Brain tissue was analyzed via Western blot and double-label immunofluorescence. Beginning at 7 months of age, APP/PS1 mice began to exhibit deficits in reference memory in the MWM test, an impairment associated with upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and NDRG2. Four weeks of EA administration significantly ameliorated cognitive impairments and suppressed GFAP and NDRG2 upregulation. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that EA administration can alleviate reference memory deficits and suppress NDRG2 upregulation in an AD transgenic mouse model. This study provides supportive evidence for EA as an effective therapeutic intervention for AD, as well as NDRG2 as a novel target for AD treatment.

24394905|t|Reduction of Liver X Receptor beta expression in primary rat neurons by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides decreases secreted amyloid beta levels.
24394905|a|Ligand-activated Liver X Receptor (LXR) is known to increase cholesterol efflux from cells and reduce the production of amyloid beta (Abeta) from amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP). However, little is known about the effects of LXRbeta, one subtype of LXR, on endogenous Abeta. In this study, we show that LXRbeta inactivation with specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (As-ODN) significantly reduced secreted Abeta and decreased mRNA levels of APP(751+770), and alpha-, beta-secretase (ADAM10, BACE1) in primary rat neurons. We also show that As-ODN down-regulated the LXR responsive genes ABCA1 and HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR). These changes are associated with decreased cellular cholesterol levels. The effect of LXRbeta inactivation on Abeta levels is likely due to the alteration of cholesterol production and APP processing. Thus, our data suggest that LXRbeta has an important function in cholesterol homeostasis and endogenous Abeta maintenance in neurons.

24397738|t|Discovery of 7-tetrahydropyran-2-yl chromans: beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) inhibitors that reduce amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) in the central nervous system.
24397738|a|In an attempt to increase selectivity vs Cathepsin D (CatD) in our BACE1 program, a series of 1,3,4,4a,10,10a-hexahydropyrano[4,3-b]chromene analogues was developed. Three different Asp-binding moieties were examined: spirocyclic acyl guanidines, aminooxazolines, and aminothiazolines in order to modulate potency, selectivity, efflux, and permeability. Using structure-based design, substitutions to improve binding to both the S3 and S2' sites of BACE1 were explored. An acyl guanidine moiety provided the most potent analogues. These compounds demonstrated 10-420 fold selectivity for BACE1 vs CatD, and were highly potent in a cell assay measuring Abeta1-40 production (5-99 nM). They also suffered from high efflux. Despite this undesirable property, two of the acyl guanidines achieved free brain concentrations (Cfree,brain) in a guinea pig PD model sufficient to cover their cell IC50s. Moreover, a significant reduction of Abeta1-40 in guinea pig, rat, and cyno CSF (58%, 53%, and 63%, respectively) was observed for compound 62.

24397771|t|Rational design of a structural framework with potential use to develop chemical reagents that target and modulate multiple facets of Alzheimer's disease.
24397771|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by multiple, intertwined pathological features, including amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregation, metal ion dyshomeostasis, and oxidative stress. We report a novel compound (ML) prototype of a rationally designed molecule obtained by integrating structural elements for Abeta aggregation control, metal chelation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation, and antioxidant activity within a single molecule. Chemical, biochemical, ion mobility mass spectrometric, and NMR studies indicate that the compound ML targets metal-free and metal-bound Abeta (metal-Abeta) species, suppresses Abeta aggregation in vitro, and diminishes toxicity induced by Abeta and metal-treated Abeta in living cells. Comparison of ML to its structural moieties (i.e., 4-(dimethylamino)phenol (DAP) and (8-aminoquinolin-2-yl)methanol (1)) for reactivity with Abeta and metal-Abeta suggests the synergy of incorporating structural components for both metal chelation and Abeta interaction. Moreover, ML is water-soluble and potentially brain permeable, as well as regulates the formation and presence of free radicals. Overall, we demonstrate that a rational structure-based design strategy can generate a small molecule that can target and modulate multiple factors, providing a new tool to uncover and address AD complexity.

24401146|t|Soluble gamma-secretase modulators selectively inhibit the production of the 42-amino acid amyloid beta peptide variant and augment the production of multiple carboxy-truncated amyloid beta species.
24401146|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized pathologically by an abundance of extracellular neuritic plaques composed primarily of the 42-amino acid amyloid beta peptide variant (Abeta42). In the majority of familial AD (FAD) cases, e.g., those harboring mutations in presenilin 1 (PS1), there is a relative increase in the levels of Abeta42 compared to the levels of Abeta40. We previously reported the characterization of a series of aminothiazole-bridged aromates termed aryl aminothiazole gamma-secretase modulators or AGSMs [Kounnas, M. Z., et al. (2010) Neuron 67, 769-780] and showed their potential for use in the treatment of FAD [Wagner, S. L., et al. (2012) Arch. Neurol. 69, 1255-1258]. Here we describe a series of GSMs with physicochemical properties improved compared to those of AGSMs. Specific heterocycle replacements of the phenyl rings in AGSMs provided potent molecules with improved aqueous solubilities. A number of these soluble gamma-secretase modulators (SGSMs) potently lowered Abeta42 levels without inhibiting proteolysis of Notch or causing accumulation of amyloid precursor protein carboxy-terminal fragments, even at concentrations approximately 1000-fold greater than their IC50 values for reducing Abeta42 levels. The effects of one potent SGSM on Abeta peptide production were verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, showing enhanced production of a number of carboxy-truncated Abeta species. This SGSM also inhibited Abeta42 peptide production in a highly purified reconstituted gamma-secretase in vitro assay system and retained the ability to modulate gamma-secretase-mediated proteolysis in a stably transfected cell culture model overexpressing a human PS1 mutation validating the potential for use in FAD.

24401368|t|Expression of amyloid-associated miRNAs in both the forebrain cortex and hippocampus of middle-aged rat.
24401368|a|BACKGROUND: Aging is associated with the gradual cognitive decline and shows the typical senile plaque formation in the brain, which results from the aggregation of beta amyloid (Abeta) peptide following the abnormal proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-secretase (BACE1) and gamma-secretase. Accumulating evidence indicates that several microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) by regulating the expression of APP and BACE1 proteins. However, the cognitive ability and the expression profile of the APP- and BACE1-associated miRNAs in the middle-aged population are largely unknown. METHODS: The learning and memory ability in rats were determined by Morris Water Maze test. The protein levels of APP and BACE1 were detected by western blotting. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to identify the miRNAs levels in forebrain cortex and the hippocampus. RESULTS: Middle-aged rats have declined learning ability without changes in the memory ability, and increased APP and BACE1 protein expression in the forebrain cortex. Computational analysis using Targetscan and Pictar databases reveals that totally 4 predicted miRNAs have conserved binding site with APP, namely miR-106b, -17-5p, -153, -101. All of them showed decreased expression in both the forebrain cortex and hippocampus. Among the 10 predicted miRNAs targeting BACE1, different expression profiles were identified in the forebrain cortex (decreased: miR-9, -19a, -135a, -15b, -16, -195, -29c, -214; increased: miR-124; no change: miR-141) and the hippocampus (decreased: miR-9, -15b, -16, -195, -29c, -124; increased: miR-19a, -135a, -214, -141) in the middle-aged rats compared with the young rats. CONCLUSION: Our results provided the first evidence that middle-aged rats have begun displaying cognitive disability with abnormal expression of APP- and BACE1-related miRNAs in the hippocampus and forebrain cortex.

24402880|t|Amyloid beta-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs) induce abnormal expression of insulin receptors in rat hippocampal neurons.
24402880|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) is an important pathogenic factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that administration of amyloid-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs) prepared from a synthetic Abeta(1-42) amyloid peptide can cause defective expression of insulin receptors (IRs). To this end, primary rat hippocampal neurons were treated with various concentrations of ADDLs and expression levels of IRs were measured using real-time PCR and western blots. In these experiments, the expression of IRs significantly increased following treatment with low concentrations of Abeta(1-42). In contrast, when higher concentrations of Abeta(1-42) were applied, the number of apoptotic cells present increased, and expression of IRs significantly decreased. In combination, these results suggest that ADDLs is able to induce abnormal expression of IRs and interrupt normal insulin signaling, thereby potentially contributing to central insulin resistance that can occur during progression of AD.

24406245|t|Therapeutic approaches against common structural features of toxic oligomers shared by multiple amyloidogenic proteins.
24406245|a|Impaired proteostasis is one of the main features of all amyloid diseases, which are associated with the formation of insoluble aggregates from amyloidogenic proteins. The aggregation process can be caused by overproduction or poor clearance of these proteins. However, numerous reports suggest that amyloid oligomers are the most toxic species, rather than insoluble fibrillar material, in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Prion diseases, among others. Although the exact protein that aggregates varies between amyloid disorders, they all share common structural features that can be used as therapeutic targets. In this review, we focus on therapeutic approaches against shared features of toxic oligomeric structures and future directions.

24407428|t|Impairment of in vivo calcium signaling in amyloid plaque-associated microglia.
24407428|a|Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) both in man and in multiple mouse models, and epidemiological studies link the use of anti-inflammatory drugs with a reduced risk of developing the disease. AD-related neuroinflammation is largely mediated by microglia, the main immune cells of the central nervous system. In vitro, executive functions of microglia are regulated by intracellular Ca(2+) signals, but little is known about microglial Ca(2+) signaling in vivo. Here we analyze in vivo properties of these cells in two mouse models of AD. In both strains plaque-associated microglia had hypertrophic/amoeboid morphology and were strongly positive for markers of activation such as CD11b and CD68. Activated microglia failed to respond reliably to extracellular release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP, mimicking tissue damage) and showed an increased incidence of spontaneous intracellular Ca(2+) transients. These Ca(2+) transients required activation of ATP receptors and Ca(2+) release from the intracellular Ca(2+) stores, and were not induced by neuronal or astrocytic hyperactivity. Neuronal silencing, however, selectively increased the frequency of Ca(2+) transients in plaque-associated microglia. Thus, our in vivo data reveal substantial dysfunction of plaque-associated microglia and identify a novel Ca(2+) signal possibly triggering a Ca(2+)-dependent release of toxic species in the plaque vicinity.

24410358|t|Comparison of structure determination methods for intrinsically disordered amyloid-beta peptides.
24410358|a|Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) represent a new frontier in structural biology since the primary characteristic of IDPs is that structures need to be characterized as diverse ensembles of conformational substates. We compare two general but very different ways of combining NMR spectroscopy with theoretical methods to derive structural ensembles for the disease IDPs amyloid-beta 1-40 and amyloid-beta 1-42, which are associated with Alzheimer's Disease. We analyze the performance of de novo molecular dynamics and knowledge-based approaches for generating structural ensembles by assessing their ability to reproduce a range of NMR experimental observables. In addition to the comparison of computational methods, we also evaluate the relative value of different types of NMR data for refining or validating the IDP structural ensembles for these important disease peptides.

24411731|t|Increased brain penetration and potency of a therapeutic antibody using a monovalent molecular shuttle.
24411731|a|Although biotherapeutics have vast potential for treating brain disorders, their use has been limited due to low exposure across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We report that by manipulating the binding mode of an antibody fragment to the transferrin receptor (TfR), we have developed a Brain Shuttle module, which can be engineered into a standard therapeutic antibody for successful BBB transcytosis. Brain Shuttle version of an anti-Abeta antibody, which uses a monovalent binding mode to the TfR, increases beta-Amyloid target engagement in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease by 55-fold compared to the parent antibody. We provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that the monovalent binding mode facilitates transcellular transport, whereas a bivalent binding mode leads to lysosome sorting. Enhanced target engagement of the Brain Shuttle module translates into a significant improvement in amyloid reduction. These findings have major implications for the development of biologics-based treatment of brain disorders.

24412310|t|Spreading of amyloid-beta peptides via neuritic cell-to-cell transfer is dependent on insufficient cellular clearance.
24412310|a|The spreading of pathology through neuronal pathways is likely to be the cause of the progressive cognitive loss observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases. We have recently shown the propagation of AD pathology via cell-to-cell transfer of oligomeric amyloid beta (Abeta) residues 1-42 (oAbeta1-42) using our donor-acceptor 3-D co-culture model. We now show that different Abeta-isoforms (fluorescently labeled 1-42, 3(pE)-40, 1-40 and 11-42 oligomers) can transfer from one cell to another. Thus, transfer is not restricted to a specific Abeta-isoform. Although different Abeta isoforms can transfer, differences in the capacity to clear and/or degrade these aggregated isoforms result in vast differences in the net amounts ending up in the receiving cells and the net remaining Abeta can cause seeding and pathology in the receiving cells. This insufficient clearance and/or degradation by cells creates sizable intracellular accumulations of the aggregation-prone Abeta1-42 isoform, which further promotes cell-to-cell transfer; thus, oAbeta1-42 is a potentially toxic isoform. Furthermore, cell-to-cell transfer is shown to be an early event that is seemingly independent of later appearances of cellular toxicity. This phenomenon could explain how seeds for the AD pathology could pass on to new brain areas and gradually induce AD pathology, even before the first cell starts to deteriorate, and how cell-to-cell transfer can act together with the factors that influence cellular clearance and/or degradation in the development of AD.

24412510|t|Hydrogen sulfide improves spatial memory impairment and decreases production of Abeta in APP/PS1 transgenic mice.
24412510|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is defined both by its progressive cognitive deterioration and hallmark increase in neuronal Abeta plaque formation. However, many of the underlying neurobiological facets of this disease are still being elucidated. Previous research has demonstrated that production of neuronal hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is significantly decreased in patients with AD. Moreover, systemic plasma H2S levels are negatively correlated with its severity. However, how a decrease in H2S production might be correlated with either the etiology or pathophysiology of AD remains unknown. To better understand the role of H2S in AD, we examined both levels of H2S and the expression and activity H2S-synthesizing enzyme (cystathionine beta synthase or CBS) in an APP/PS1 transgenic mouse line at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. After intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of an H2S donor (NaHS) into APP/PS1 mice, application of exogenous H2S resulted in improved spatial learning and memory acquisition in APP/PS1 mice. H2S administration also led to significant decrease in extracellular levels of Abeta40 and Abeta42, the expression of BACE1 and PS1, and a significant increase of ADAM17 expression. Similarly, an increase in non-amyloidogenic C83 fragment generation and a decrease in amyloidogenic C99 fragment generation were also observed. Thus, NaHS application resulted in a shift from the plaque-forming beta pathway to the non-plaque forming alpha pathway of APP cleavage in 6 and 12 month APP/PS1 mice. These results indicate the importance of H2S to AD severity and that administration of exogenous H2S can promote a non-amyloidogenic processing of APP.

24415002|t|Early fear memory defects are associated with altered synaptic plasticity and molecular architecture in the TgCRND8 Alzheimer's disease mouse model.
24415002|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex and slowly progressing dementing disorder that results in neuronal and synaptic loss, deposition in brain of aberrantly folded proteins, and impairment of spatial and episodic memory. Most studies of mouse models of AD have employed analyses of cognitive status and assessment of amyloid burden, gliosis, and molecular pathology during disease progression. Here we sought to understand the behavioral, cellular, ultrastructural, and molecular changes that occur at a pathological stage equivalent to the early stages of human AD. We studied the TgCRND8 mouse, a model of aggressive AD amyloidosis, at an early stage of plaque pathology (3 months of age) in comparison to their wildtype littermates and assessed changes in cognition, neuron and spine structure, and expression of synaptic glutamate receptor proteins. We found that, at this age, TgCRND8 mice display substantial plaque deposition in the neocortex and hippocampus and impairment on cued and contextual memory tasks. Of particular interest, we also observed a significant decrease in the number of neurons in the hippocampus. Furthermore, analysis of CA1 neurons revealed significant changes in apical and basal dendritic spine types, as well as altered expression of GluN1 and GluA2 receptors. This change in molecular architecture within the hippocampus may reflect a rising representation of inherently less stable thin spine populations, which can cause cognitive decline. These changes, taken together with toxic insults from amyloid-beta protein, may underlie the observed neuronal loss.

24418052|t|Basal forebrain atrophy and cortical amyloid deposition in nondemented elderly subjects.
24418052|a|BACKGROUND: Both neurodegeneration of the cholinergic basal forebrain (BF) and deposition of beta-amyloid are early events in the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Associations between increased amyloid pathology and cholinergic atrophy have been described in autopsy studies. METHODS: We used structural MRI and AV45-PET amyloid imaging data of 225 cognitively normal or mildly impaired elderly subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative to assess in vivo associations between BF atrophy and cortical amyloid deposition. Associations were examined using region-of-interest (ROI) and voxel-based approaches with reference to cytoarchitectonic mappings of the cholinergic BF nuclei. RESULTS: ROI- and voxel-based approaches yielded complementary evidence for an association between BF volume and cortical amyloid deposition in presymptomatic and predementia stages of AD, irrespective of age, gender, and APOE genotype. CONCLUSIONS: The observed correlations between BF atrophy and cortical amyloid load likely reflect associations between cholinergic degeneration and amyloid pathology as reported in neuropathologic examination studies.

24418060|a|Florbetapir (18F) for brain amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has been recently approved in Europe to estimate beta-amyloid neuritic plaque density in the brain when the subject is still alive. Such density is one of the key issues for the definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) at autopsy. This capability of florbetapir (18F) is regarded as a significant improvement in the diagnostic procedures for adult patients with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for AD and other causes of cognitive impairment. The current paper highlights the specific characteristics of the European marketing authorization of florbetapir (18F).

24418061|a|BACKGROUND: Previous work examining normal controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) identified substantial biological heterogeneity. We hypothesized that ADNI mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects would also exhibit heterogeneity with possible clinical implications. METHODS: ADNI subjects diagnosed with amnestic MCI (n=138) were clustered based on baseline magnetic resonance imaging, cerebrospinal fluid, and serum biomarkers. The clusters were compared with respect to longitudinal atrophy, cognitive trajectory, and time to conversion. RESULTS: Four clusters emerged with distinct biomarker patterns: The first cluster was biologically similar to normal controls and rarely converted to Alzheimer's disease (AD) during follow-up. The second cluster had characteristics of early Alzheimer's pathology. The third cluster showed the most severe atrophy but barely abnormal tau levels and a substantial proportion converted to clinical AD. The fourth cluster appeared to be pre-AD and nearly all converted to AD. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with MCI who were clinically similar showed substantial heterogeneity in biomarkers.

24418316|t|Simulations of monomeric amyloid beta-peptide (1-40) with varying solution conditions and oxidation state of Met35: implications for aggregation.
24418316|a|The amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) is a 40-42 residue peptide that is the principal toxic species in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The oxidation of methionine-35 (Met35) to the sulfoxide form (Met35(ox)) has been identified as potential modulator of Abeta aggregation. The role Met35(ox) plays in Abeta neurotoxicity differs among experimental studies, which may be due to inconsistent solution conditions (pH, buffer, temperature). We applied atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations as a means to probe the dynamics of the monomeric 40-residue alloform of Abeta (Abeta40) containing Met35 or Met35(ox) in an effort to resolve the conflicting experimental results. We found that Met35 oxidation decreases the beta-strand content of the C-terminal hydrophobic region (residues 29-40), with a specific effect on the secondary structure of residues 33-35, thus potentially impeding aggregation. Further, there is an important interplay between oxidation state and solution conditions, with pH and salt concentration augmenting the effects of oxidation. The results presented here serve to rationalize the conflicting results seen in experimental studies and provide a fundamental biophysical characterization of monomeric Abeta40 dynamics in both reduced and oxidized forms, providing insight into the biochemical mechanism of Abeta40 and oxidative stress related to AD.

24418687|t|Repeated intra-hippocampal injection of beta-amyloid 25-35 induces a reproducible impairment of learning and memory: considering caspase-3 and MAPKs activity.
24418687|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by accumulation of beta amyloid (Abeta) and neuronal loss, particularly in the hippocampus. Direct central administration of this peptide was suggested as a route to create an animal model of AD. Although there are some studies indicating that a single dose of Abeta induces AD-like learning and memory impairment, this model is not usually reproducible especially in rat. Then one of the aims of this study was to explore a more reliable method to trigger AD-like behavioral impairments in rat through a series of pilot studies. In other step, according to some controversies about roles of MAPKs (P38, JNK and ERK) in AD, these kinases were assayed in beta amyloid-treated rats with or without memory impairment. A series of pilot studies was done to assess if a single Abeta injection (5, 10, 15 microg/each side) induces reproducible memory impairment. Because of the failure of that set of studies, another set of experiment with repeated Abeta administration during four days was carried out. The results showed that in contrast to single treatment of beta amyloid, its repeated administration (5 microg/2.5 microl each side/day) during 4 days led to memory deterioration. Hippocampal western blot analysis revealed that behavioral impairment is in parallel with greater apoptosis and MAPKs activation. This study introduces a new method for inducing AD models by repeated intra-CA1 injection of Abeta25-35. Additionally it elucidates how caspase-3 and MAPKs activity differ between beta amyloid-treated rats with or without learning and memory impairment.

24419041|t|An anemia of Alzheimer's disease.
24419041|a|Lower hemoglobin is associated with cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since brain iron homeostasis is perturbed in AD, we investigated whether this is peripherally reflected in the hematological and related blood chemistry values from the Australian Imaging Biomarker and Lifestyle (AIBL) study (a community-based, cross-sectional cohort comprising 768 healthy controls (HC), 133 participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 211 participants with AD). We found that individuals with AD had significantly lower hemoglobin, mean cell hemoglobin concentrations, packed cell volume and higher erythrocyte sedimentation rates (adjusted for age, gender, APOE-e4 and site). In AD, plasma iron, transferrin, transferrin saturation and red cell folate levels exhibited a significant distortion of their customary relationship to hemoglobin levels. There was a strong association between anemia and AD (adjusted odds ratio (OR)=2.43, confidence interval (CI) (1.31, 4.54)). Moreover, AD emerged as a strong risk factor for anemia on step-down regression, even when controlling for all other available explanations for anemia (adjusted OR=3.41, 95% CI (1.68, 6.92)). These data indicated that AD is complicated by anemia, which may itself contribute to cognitive decline.

24421399|t|Amyloid beta peptide stimulates platelet activation through RhoA-dependent modulation of actomyosin organization.
24421399|a|Platelets contribute to 95% of circulating amyloid precursor protein in the body and have widely been employed as a "peripheral" model of neurons in Alzheimer's disease. We sought to analyze the effects of amyloid beta (Abeta) on platelets and to understand the underlying molecular mechanism. The Abeta active fragment containing amino acid sequence 25-35 (Abeta(25-35); 10-20 muM) was found to induce strong aggregation of human platelets, granule release, and integrin activation, similar to that elicited by physiological agonists. Platelets exposed to Abeta(25-35) retracted fibrin clot and displayed augmented adhesion to collagen under arterial shear, reflective of a switch to prothrombotic phenotype. Exposure of platelets to Abeta peptide (20 muM) resulted in a 4.2- and 2.3-fold increase in phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) and MLC phosphatase, respectively, which was reversed by Y27632, an inhibitor of Rho-associated coiled-coil protein kinase (ROCK). Abeta(25-35)-induced platelet aggregation and clot retraction were also significantly attenuated by Y27632. Consistent with these findings, Abeta(25-35) elicited a significant rise in the level of RhoA-GTP in platelets. Platelets pretreated with reverse-sequenced Abeta fragment (Abeta(35-25)) and untreated resting platelets served as controls. We conclude that Abeta induces cellular activation through RhoA-dependent modulation of actomyosin, and hence, RhoA could be a potential therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy.

24424028|t|The Abeta1-42 peptide regulates microtubule stability independently of tau.
24424028|a|Interference with microtubule stability by beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) has been shown to disrupt dendritic function and axonal trafficking, both early events in Alzheimer's disease. However, it is unclear whether Abeta regulation of microtubule dynamics can occur independently of its action on tau. RhoA has been implicated in neurotoxicity by Abeta but the mechanism by which this activation generates cytoskeletal changes is also unclear. We found that oligomeric Abeta1-42 induced the formation of stable detyrosinated microtubules in NIH3T3 cells and this function resulted from the activation of a RhoA-dependent microtubule stabilization pathway regulated by integrin signaling and the formin mDia1. Induction of microtubule stability by Abeta was also initiated by dimerization of APP and required caspase activity, two previously characterized regulators of neurotoxicity downstream of Abeta. Finally, we found that this function was conserved in primary neurons and abolished by Rho inactivation, reinforcing a link between induction of stable detyrosinated microtubules and neuropathogenesis by Abeta. Our study reveals a novel activity of Abeta on the microtubule cytoskeleton that is independent of tau and associated with pathways linked to microtubule stabilization and Abeta-mediated neurotoxicity.

24424093|t|Amyloid beta binds procaspase-9 to inhibit assembly of Apaf-1 apoptosome and intrinsic apoptosis pathway.
24424093|a|Apoptosis is essential in the death process induced by Amyloid-beta (Abeta), a major constituent of diffuse plaques found in Alzheimer's disease patients. However, we have found that caspase activation and cell death induced by staurosporine, employed to induce the intrinsic mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway, were significantly reduced by 42 amino-acid Abeta42, implying that the peptide also has a negative effect on the apoptotic process. The inhibitory effect of Abeta42 on the apoptotic pathway is associated with its interaction with procaspase-9 and consequent inhibition of Apaf-1 apoptosome assembly. We detected the inhibitory effect in the early stage (<8h) of apoptosis, but later caspase activation becomes obvious. Thus we inferred that the inhibitory process on apoptosis begins at an early stage, and the later robust activation surpasses it. We propose that the apoptotic manifestation in Abeta-treated cells is a combined consequence of those anti- and pro-apoptotic processes.

24430238|t|Leptin gene therapy attenuates neuronal damages evoked by amyloid-beta and rescues memory deficits in APP/PS1 mice.
24430238|a|There is growing evidence that leptin is able to ameliorate Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like pathologies, including brain amyloid-beta (Abeta) burden. In order to improve the therapeutic potential for AD, we generated a lentivirus vector expressing leptin protein in a self-inactivating HIV-1 vector (HIV-leptin), and delivered this by intra-cerebroventricular administration to APP/PS1 transgenic model of AD. Three months after intra-cerebroventricular administration of HIV-leptin, brain Abeta accumulation was reduced. By electron microscopy, we found that APP/PS1 mice exhibited deficits in synaptic density, which were partially rescued by HIV-leptin treatment. Synaptic deficits in APP/PS1 mice correlated with an enhancement of caspase-3 expression, and a reduction in synaptophysin levels in synaptosome preparations. Notably, HIV-leptin therapy reverted these dysfunctions. Moreover, leptin modulated neurite outgrowth in primary neuronal cultures, and rescued them from Abeta42-induced toxicity. All the above changes suggest that leptin may affect multiple aspects of the synaptic status, and correlate with behavioral improvements. Our data suggest that leptin gene delivery has a therapeutic potential for Abeta-targeted treatment of mouse model of AD.

24432010|t|Cerebral microbleeds: a review of clinical, genetic, and neuroimaging associations.
24432010|a|Cerebral microbleeds (microbleeds) are small, punctuate hypointense lesions seen in T2* Gradient-Recall Echo (GRE) and Susceptibility-Weighted (SWI) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sequences, corresponding to areas of hemosiderin breakdown products from prior microscopic hemorrhages. They occur in the setting of impaired small vessel integrity, commonly due to either hypertensive vasculopathy or cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Microbleeds are more prevalent in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia and in those with both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. However they are also found in asymptomatic individuals, with increasing prevalence with age, particularly in carriers of the Apolipoprotein (APOE) epsilon4 allele. Other neuroimaging findings that have been linked with microbleeds include lacunar infarcts and white matter hyperintensities on MRI, and increased cerebral beta-amyloid burden using (11)C-PiB Positron Emission Tomography. The presence of microbleeds has been suggested to confer increased risk of incident intracerebral hemorrhage - particularly in the setting of anticoagulation - and of complications of immunotherapy for AD. Prospective data regarding the natural history and sequelae of microbleeds are currently limited, however there is a growing evidence base that will serve to inform clinical decision-making in the future.

24435206|t|Short- and long-term treatment of mouse cortical primary astrocytes with beta-amyloid differentially regulates the mRNA expression of L-type calcium channels.
24435206|a|BACKGROUND: It is well established that reactive astrocytes express L-type calcium channels (LTCC), but their functional role is completely unknown. We have recently shown that reactive astrocytes highly express the CaV1.2 alpha1-subunit around beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques in an Alzheimer mouse model. The aim of the present study was to explore whether Abeta peptides may regulate the mRNA expression of all LTCC subunits in primary mouse astrocytes in culture. METHODS: Confluent primary astrocytes were incubated with 10 microg/ml of human or murine Abeta or the toxic fragment Abeta25-35 for 3 days or for 3 weeks. The LTCC subunits were determined by quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: Our data show that murine Abeta42 slightly but significantly increased CaV1.2 and CaV1.3 expression when incubated for 3 days. This acute treatment with murine Abeta enhanced beta2 and beta3 mRNA levels but decreased alpha2delta-2 mRNA expression. When astrocytes were incubated for 3 weeks, the levels of CaV1.2 alpha1 were significantly decreased by the murine Abeta and the toxic fragment. As a control, the protein kinase C-epsilon activator DCP-LA displayed a decrease in CaV2.1 expression. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our data show that Abeta can differentially regulate LTCC expression in primary mouse astrocytes depending on incubation time.

24435631|t|Long-term effect of telmisartan on Alzheimer's amyloid genesis in SHR-SR after tMCAO.
24435631|a|Telmisartan is expected to reduce not only the level of blood pressure but also neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity via pleiotrophic effects as a metabo-sartan. We examined the effects of telmisartan on Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in spontaneously hypertensive rat stroke resistant (SHR-SR) after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) by giving either telmisartan at 0 (vehicle), 0.3 mg/kg/day (low dose, with no reduction of blood pressure), or 3 mg/kg/day (high dose, with a significant reduction of blood pressure) p.o. from 3 months (M) of age, and performed immunohistological analysis at 6, 12, and 18 M of age. The numbers of amyloid beta (Abeta)-positive neurons in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus and senile plaque (SP) in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex progressively increased with age until 18 M in the SHR-SR after tMCAO. On the other hand, low-dose telmisartan significantly reduced the number of Abeta-positive neuron as well as SP at 6, 12, and 18 M. High-dose telmisartan showed further reductions of the above AD pathology. The present study suggests that telmisartan reduced both intracellular Abeta and extracellular SP accumulations after tMCAO in SHR-SR, with a further improvement by combined BP lowering. Such a strong effect of telmisartan could provide a preventative approach for AD in post-stroke patients with hypertension.

24436056|t|Amyloid beta-peptide 1-42 modulates the proliferation of mouse neural stem cells: upregulation of fucosyltransferase IX and notch signaling.
24436056|a|Amyloid beta-peptides (Abetas) aggregate to form amyloid plaques, also known as senile plaques, which are a major pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abetas are reported to possess proliferation effects on neural stem cells (NSCs); however, this effect remains controversial. Thus, clarification of their physiological function is an important topic. We have systematically evaluated the effects of several putative bioactive Abetas (Abeta1-40, Abeta1-42, and Abeta25-35) on NSC proliferation. Treatment of NSCs with Abeta1-42 significantly increased the number of those cells (149 +- 10 %). This was not observed with Abeta1-40 which did not have any effects on the proliferative property of NSC. Abeta25-35, on the other hand, exhibited inhibitory effects on cellular proliferation. Since cell surface glycoconjugates, such as glycolipids, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans, are known to be important for maintaining cell fate determination, including cellular proliferation, in NSCs and they undergo dramatic changes during differentiation, we examined the effect of Abetas on a number of key glycoconjugate metabolizing enzymes. Significantly, we found for the first time that Abeta1-42 altered the expression of several key glycosyltransferases and glycosidases, including fucosyltransferase IX (FUT9), sialyltransferase III (ST-III), glucosylceramide ceramidase (GLCC), and mitochondrial sialidase (Neu4). FUT9 is a key enzyme for the synthesis of the Lewis X carbohydrate epitope, which is known to be expressed in stem cells. Abeta1-42 also stimulated the Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) by upregulation of the expression of Musashi-1 and the paired box protein, Pax6. Thus, Abeta1-42 upregulates NSC proliferation by modulating the expression of several glycogenes involved in Notch signaling.

24438129|t|C-terminal peptides modelling constitutive PrPC processing demonstrate ameliorated toxicity predisposition consequent to alpha-cleavage.
24438129|a|Misfolding of PrPC (cellular prion protein) to beta-strand-rich conformations constitutes a key event in prion disease pathogenesis. PrPC can undergo either of two constitutive endoproteolytic events known as alpha- and beta-cleavage, yielding C-terminal fragments known as C1 and C2 respectively. It is unclear whether C-terminal fragments generated through alpha- and beta-cleavage, especially C2, influence pathogenesis directly. Consequently, we compared the biophysical properties and neurotoxicity of recombinant human PrP fragments recapitulating alpha- and beta-cleavage, namely huPrP-(112-231) (equating to C1) and huPrP-(90-231) (equating to C2). Under conditions we employed, huPrP-(112-231) could not be induced to fold into a beta-stranded isoform and neurotoxicity was not a feature for monomeric or multimeric assemblies. In contrast, huPrP-(90-231) easily adopted a beta-strand conformation, demonstrated considerable thermostability and was toxic to neurons. Synthetic PrP peptides modelled on alpha- and beta-cleavage of the unique Y145STOP (Tyr145 stop) mutant prion protein corroborated the differential toxicity observed for recombinant huPrP-(112-231) and huPrP-(90-231) and suggested that the persistence of soluble oligomeric beta-strand-rich conformers was required for significant neurotoxicity. Our results additionally indicate that alpha- and beta-cleavage of PrPC generate biophysically and biologically non-equivalent C-terminal fragments and that C1 generated through alpha-cleavage appears to be pathogenesis-averse.

24439167|t|Increased CSF alpha-synuclein levels in Alzheimer's disease: correlation with tau levels.
24439167|a|BACKGROUND: Given the difficult clinical differential diagnosis between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), growing interest resulted in research on alpha-synuclein as a potential cerebrospinal fluid biomarker (CSF) for synucleinopathies. METHODS: CSF alpha-synuclein-140 concentrations were determined by a prototype xMAP  bead-based assay (Innogenetics NV, Belgium). In addition, CSF amyloid beta1-42 (Abeta1-42), total tau (T-tau), and phosphorylated tau (P-tau181P) levels were determined. RESULTS: CSF alpha-synuclein levels were higher in AD patients as compared with cognitively healthy controls (P=.019) and patients with synucleinopathies (P<.001). CSF alpha-synuclein levels were correlated with T-tau (P<.001) and P-tau181P (P<.001) levels in autopsy-confirmed AD patients. A diagnostic algorithm using alpha-synuclein and P-tau181P discriminated neuropathologically confirmed AD from DLB patients, resulting in sensitivity and specificity values of 85% and 81%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Because CSF alpha-synuclein levels were significantly higher in AD as compared with synucleinopathies, alpha-synuclein might have a value as a biomarker for differential dementia diagnosis.

24439169|t|Microvascular network alterations in the retina of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
24439169|a|BACKGROUND: Although cerebral small-vessel disease has been implicated in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the cerebral microcirculation is difficult to visualize directly in vivo. Because the retina provides a noninvasive window to assess the microcirculation, we determined whether quantitatively measured retinal microvascular parameters are associated with AD. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study (case:control matching   1:2). Retinal photographs were analyzed using a computer program, and a spectrum of quantitative retinal microvascular parameters (caliber, fractal dimension, tortuosity, and bifurcation) were measured. Logistic regression models were used to compute the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval for AD adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and history of myocardial infarction. RESULTS: We included 136 demented patients with AD and 290 age-gender-race-matched controls. Persons with narrower venular caliber (OR per standard deviation [SD] decrease, 2.01 [1.27-3.19]), decreased arteriolar and venular fractal dimension (OR per SD decrease 1.35 [1.08-1.68], 1.47 [1.17-1.84], respectively) and increased arteriolar and venular tortuosity (OR per SD increase, 1.84 [1.40-2.31], 1.94 [1.48-2.53], respectively) were more likely to have AD. These associations still persisted when only AD cases without a history of cerebrovascular disease were included. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AD have altered microvascular network in the retina (narrower retinal venules and a sparser and more tortuous retinal vessels) compared with matched nondemented controls. These changes in retinal microvasculature may reflect similar pathophysiological processes in cerebral microvasculature in the brains of patients with AD.

24439482|t|Novel vaccine peptide GV1001 effectively blocks beta-amyloid toxicity by mimicking the extra-telomeric functions of human telomerase reverse transcriptase.
24439482|a|GV1001 is a 16-amino-acid vaccine peptide derived from the human telomerase reverse transcriptase sequence. We investigated the effects of GV1001 against beta-amyloid (Abeta) oligomer-induced neurotoxicity in rat neural stem cells (NSCs). Primary culture NSCs were treated with several concentrations of GV1001 and/or Abeta25-35 oligomer for 48 hours. GV1001 protected NSCs against the Abeta25-35 oligomer in a concentration-dependent manner. Abeta25-35 concentration dependently decreased viability, proliferation, and mobilization of NSCs and GV1001 treatment restored the cells to wild-type levels. Abeta25-35 increased free radical levels in rat NSCs while combined treatment with GV1001 significantly reduced these levels. In addition, GV1001 treatment of Abeta25-35-injured NSCs increased the expression level of survival-related proteins, including mitochondria-associated survival proteins, and decreased the levels of death and inflammation-related proteins, including mitochondria-associated death proteins. Together, these results suggest that GV1001 possesses neuroprotective effects against Abeta25-35 oligomer in NSCs and that these effects are mediated through mimicking the extra-telomeric functions of human telomerase reverse transcriptase, including the induction of cellular proliferation, anti-apoptotic effects, mitochondrial stabilization, and anti-aging and anti-oxidant effects.

24439484|t|Missense variant in TREML2 protects against Alzheimer's disease.
24439484|a|TREM and TREM-like receptors are a structurally similar protein family encoded by genes clustered on chromosome 6p21.11. Recent studies have identified a rare coding variant (p.R47H) in TREM2 that confers a high risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition, common single nucleotide polymorphisms in this genomic region are associated with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for AD and a common intergenic variant found near the TREML2 gene has been identified to be protective for AD. However, little is known about the functional variant underlying the latter association or its relationship with the p.R47H. Here, we report comprehensive analyses using whole-exome sequencing data, cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analyses, meta-analyses (16,254 cases and 20,052 controls) and cell-based functional studies to support the role of the TREML2 coding missense variant p.S144G (rs3747742) as a potential driver of the meta-analysis AD-associated genome-wide association studies signal. Additionally, we demonstrate that the protective role of TREML2 in AD is independent of the role of TREM2 gene as a risk factor for AD.

24439957|t|Age-associated dysregulation of microglial activation is coupled with enhanced blood-brain barrier permeability and pathology in APP/PS1 mice.
24439957|a|Aging adversely affects inflammatory processes in the brain, which has important implications in the context of disease progression. It has been proposed that microglia become dysfunctional with age and may lose their neuroprotective properties leading to chronic neurodegeneration. Here, we sought to characterize inflammatory changes in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and to delineate differences between normal aging and those associated with disease pathology. A proinflammatory profile, characterized by the upregulation of markers of classical activation, was evident in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice, associated with increased interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) concentration and dysregulation of mechanisms designed to limit the proinflammatory response. The data indicate that microglia are not less active with age but alter their phenotype; indeed, changes observed in the deactivation state appear to relate to aging rather than disease pathology. We hypothesize that disruption of the blood-brain barrier, in tandem with an enhanced chemokine profile, permits the infiltration of immune cells serving to reinforce classical activation of microglia through their enhanced responsiveness to IFNgamma.

24441681|t|Epigenetic suppression of neuroligin 1 underlies amyloid-induced memory deficiency.
24441681|a|Amyloid-induced microglial activation and neuroinflammation impair central synapses and memory function, although the mechanism remains unclear. Neuroligin 1 (NLGN1), a postsynaptic protein found in central excitatory synapses, governs excitatory synaptic efficacy and plasticity in the brain. Here we found, in rodents, that amyloid fibril-induced neuroinflammation enhanced the interaction between histone deacetylase 2 and methyl-CpG-binding protein 2, leading to suppressed histone H3 acetylation and enhanced cytosine methylation in the Nlgn1 promoter region and decreased NLGN1 expression, underlying amyloid-induced memory deficiency. Manipulation of microglia-associated neuroinflammation modulated the epigenetic modification of the Nlgn1 promoter, hippocampal glutamatergic transmission and memory function. These findings link neuroinflammation, synaptic efficacy and memory, thus providing insight into the pathogenesis of amyloid-associated diseases.

24442916|t|Methanolic extract of Piper nigrum fruits improves memory impairment by decreasing brain oxidative stress in amyloid beta(1-42) rat model of Alzheimer's disease.
24442916|a|The present study analyzed the possible memory-enhancing and antioxidant proprieties of the methanolic extract of Piper nigrum L. fruits (50 and 100 mg/kg, orally, for 21 days) in amyloid beta(1-42) rat model of Alzheimer's disease. The memory-enhancing effects of the plant extract were studied by means of in vivo (Y-maze and radial arm-maze tasks) approaches. Also, the antioxidant activity in the hippocampus was assessed using superoxide dismutase-, catalase-, glutathione peroxidase-specific activities and the total content of reduced glutathione, malondialdehyde, and protein carbonyl levels. The amyloid beta(1-42)-treated rats exhibited the following: decrease of spontaneous alternations percentage within Y-maze task and increase of working memory and reference memory errors within radial arm-maze task. Administration of the plant extract significantly improved memory performance and exhibited antioxidant potential.

24446209|t|Influence of APOE genotype and the presence of Alzheimer's pathology on synaptic membrane lipids of human brains.
24446209|a|The APOE genotype is the major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, it remains unclarified how the epsilon4 allele accelerates whereas the epsilon2 allele suppresses AD development, compared with the more common epsilon3 allele. On the basis of the previous finding that the assembly of the amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) into fibrils in the brain, an early and invariable pathological feature of AD, depends on the lipid environment, we determined the levels of synaptic membrane lipids in aged individuals of different APOE genotypes. In the comparison between amyloid-free epsilon2/epsilon3 and epsilon3/epsilon3 brains, the presence of the epsilon2 allele significantly decreased the level of cholesterol. Alternatively, in the comparison among epsilon3/epsilon3 brains, the presence of AD pathology substantially decreased the levels of cholesterol. This study suggests that the epsilon2 allele suppresses the initiation of AD development by lowering the cholesterol levels in synaptic membranes.

24447637|t|Variation in performance of candidate surgical quality measures for muscle-invasive bladder cancer by hospital type.
24447637|a|OBJECTIVE: To test the association between hospital type and performance of candidate quality measures for treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) using a large national tumour registry. Proposed quality measures include receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, timely treatment, adequate lymph node dissection, and continent urinary diversion. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the National Cancer Database, patients with stage >=II urothelial carcinoma treated with radical cystectomy (RC) from 2003 to 2010 were identified. Hospitals were grouped by type and annual RC volume: community, comprehensive low volume (CLV), comprehensive high volume (CHV), academic low volume (ALV), and academic high volume (AHV) groups. Logistic regression models were used to test the association between hospital group and performance of quality measures, adjusting for year, demographic, and clinical/pathological characteristics; generalised estimating equations were fitted to the models to adjust for clustering at the hospital level. RESULTS: In all, 23 279 patients underwent RC at community (12.4%), comprehensive (CLV 38%, CHV 5%), and academic (ALV 17%, AHV 28%) hospitals. While only 0.8% (175) of patients met all four quality criteria, 61% of patients treated at AHV hospitals met two or more quality metric indicators compared with ALV (45%), CHV (44%), CLV (38%), and community (37%) hospitals (P < 0.001). After adjustment, patients were more likely to receive two or more quality measures when treated at AHV (odds ratio [OR] 2.4, confidence interval [CI] 2.0-2.9), ALV (OR 1.3, CI 1.1-1.6), and CHV (OR 1.3, CI 1.03-1.7) hospitals compared with community hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing RC at AHV hospitals were more likely to meet quality criteria. However, performance remains low across hospital types, highlighting the opportunity to improve quality of care for MIBC.

24448790|t|Caffeoylquinic acids in Centella asiatica protect against amyloid-beta toxicity.
24448790|a|The accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease and is known to result in neurotoxicity both in vivo and in vitro. We previously demonstrated that treatment with the water extract of Centella asiatica (CAW) improves learning and memory deficits in Tg2576 mice, an animal model of Abeta accumulation. However the active compounds in CAW remain unknown. Here we used two in vitro models of Abeta toxicity to confirm this neuroprotective effect and identify several active constituents of the CAW extract. CAW reduced Abeta-induced cell death and attenuated Abeta-induced changes in tau expression and phosphorylation in both the MC65 and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell lines. We confirmed and quantified the presence of several mono- and dicaffeoylquinic acids (CQAs) in CAW using chromatographic separation coupled to mass spectrometry and ultraviolet spectroscopy. Multiple dicaffeoylquinic acids showed efficacy in protecting MC65 cells against Abeta-induced cytotoxicity. Isochlorogenic acid A and 1,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid were found to be the most abundant CQAs in CAW, and the most active in protecting MC65 cells from Abeta-induced cell death. Both compounds showed neuroprotective activity in MC65 and SH-SY5Y cells at concentrations comparable to their levels in CAW. Each compound not only mitigated Abeta-induced cell death, but was able to attenuate Abeta-induced alterations in tau expression and phosphorylation in both cell lines, as seen with CAW. These data suggest that CQAs are active neuroprotective components in CAW, and therefore are important markers for future studies on CAW standardization, bioavailability, and dosing.

24450926|t|Neuropathologic assessment of dementia markers in identical and fraternal twins.
24450926|a|Twin studies are an incomparable source of investigation to shed light on genetic and non-genetic components of neurodegenerative diseases, as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Detailed clinicopathologic correlations using twin longitudinal data and post-mortem examinations are mostly missing. We describe clinical and pathologic findings of seven monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs. Our findings show good agreement between clinical and pathologic diagnoses in the majority of the twin pairs, with greater neuropathologic concordance in MZ than DZ twins. Greater neuropathologic concordance was found for beta-amyloid than tau pathology within the pairs. ApoE4 was associated with higher beta-amyloid and earlier dementia onset, and importantly, higher frequency of other co-occurring brain pathologies, regardless of the zygosity. Dementia onset, dementia duration, difference between twins in age at dementia onset and at death, did not correlate with AD pathology. These clinicopathologic correlations of older identical and fraternal twins support the relevance of genetic factors in AD, but not their sufficiency to determine the pathology, and consequently the disease, even in monozygotic twins. It is the interaction among genetic and non-genetic risks which plays a major role in influencing, or probably determining, the degeneration of those brain circuits associated with pathology and cognitive deficits in AD.

24456077|t|Potency prediction of beta-secretase (BACE-1) inhibitors using density functional methods.
24456077|a|Scoring potency is a main challenge for structure based drug design. Inductive effects of subtle variations in the ligand are not possible to accurately predict by classical computational chemistry methods. In this study, the problem of predicting potency of ligands with electronic variations participating in key interactions with the protein was addressed. The potency was predicted for a large set of cyclic amidine and guanidine cores extracted from beta-secretase (BACE-1) inhibitors. All cores were of similar size and had equal interaction motifs but were diverse with respect to electronic substitutions. A density functional theory approach, in combination with a representation of the active site of a protein using only key residues, was shown to be predictive. This computational approach was used to guide and support drug design, within the time frame of a normal drug discovery design cycle.

24456271|t|Metallothioneins and synthetic metal chelators as potential therapeutic agents for removal of aberrant metal ions from metal-Abeta species.
24456271|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide in the brains of AD patients. Such a process is linked to the binding of metal ions (e.g., Cu, Fe and Zn) with Abeta. As a result, metal chelation could be used as a rational therapeutic pathway for the treatment of AD. In this review, we address some noteworthy advances on the utilization of metal chelators, such as native metallothioneins and synthetic compounds, as potential therapeutic agents for AD. In addition, the future design and utility of metal chelating drugs as well as the strategy pursued to transport metal chelators into the brain are highlighted. We believe that this contribution will be valuable for the design of metal-chelating drugs for AD treatment.

24456637|t|Gamma-hydroxybutyrate, acting through an anti-apoptotic mechanism, protects native and amyloid-precursor-protein-transfected neuroblastoma cells against oxidative stress-induced death.
24456637|a|Clinical observations suggested that gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) protects nerve cells against death but the direct proofs are missing. Here, we combined several approaches to investigate GHB capacity to protect human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced death. To increase the patho-physiological relevancy of our study, we used native SH-SY5Y cells and SH-SY5Y cells stably transfected with the wild-type amyloid-precursor-protein (APPwt) or control-vector-pCEP4. Trypan Blue exclusion and MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium-bromide) assays combined with pharmacological analyses showed that H2O2 reduced native and genetically modified cell viability and APPwt-transfected cells were the most vulnerable. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and activated caspase-3 staining assessed by flow cytometry revealed a basally elevated apoptotic signal in APPwt-transfected cells. Reverse-transcription, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blotting showed that mRNA and protein basal ratios of apoptotic modulators Bax/Bcl-2 were also high in APPwt-transfected cells. GHB efficiently and dose-dependently rescued native and genetically modified cells from H2O2-induced death. Interestingly, GHB, which strongly decreased elevated basal levels of TUNEL-staining, activated caspase 3-labeling and Bax/Bcl-2 in APPwt-transfected cells, also counteracted H2O2-evoked increased apoptotic markers in native and genetically modified SH-SY5Y cells. Since GHB did not promote cell proliferation, anti-apoptotic action through the down-regulation of Bax/Bcl-2 ratios and/or caspase 3 activity appears as a critical mechanism involved in GHB-induced protection of SH-SY5Y cells against APPwt-overexpression- or H2O2-evoked death. Altogether, these results, providing multi-parametric evidence for the existence of neuroprotective action of GHB, also open interesting perspectives for the development of GHB analog-based strategies against neurodegeneration or nerve cell death.

24462250|a|Proteolysis of the beta C-terminal fragment (beta-CTF) of the amyloid precursor protein generates the Abeta peptides associated with Alzheimer's disease. Familial mutations in the beta-CTF, such as the A21G Flemish mutation, can increase Abeta secretion. We establish how the Flemish mutation alters the structure of C55, the first 55 residues of the beta-CTF, using FTIR and solid-state NMR spectroscopy. We show that the A21G mutation reduces beta sheet structure of C55 from Leu17 to Ala21, an inhibitory region near the site of the mutation, and increases alpha-helical structure from Gly25 to Gly29, in a region near the membrane surface and thought to interact with cholesterol. Cholesterol also increases Abeta peptide secretion, and we show that the incorporation of cholesterol into model membranes enhances the structural changes induced by the Flemish mutant, suggesting a common link between familial mutations and the cellular environment.

24462566|t|Polymorphisms in BACE2 may affect the age of onset Alzheimer's dementia in Down syndrome.
24462566|a|It is known that Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents at an early age in people with Down syndrome (DS). The trisomy 21 in DS provides an opportunity to study the effect of duplicated genes in AD. APP and BACE2 are 2 genes located in chromosome 21 and related to AD. We looked into our cohort of 67 DS cases with dementia for the effect of BACE2 variants in age of onset of dementia. Of the 83 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 6 were associated with age of onset and another 8 SNPs were borderline associated. Our finding also replicated a previous study showing association of rs2252576 with AD.

24464312|t|Differences between amyloid-beta aggregation in solution and on the membrane: insights into elucidation of the mechanistic details of Alzheimer's disease.
24464312|a|The association of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide with cellular membranes is hypothesized to be the underlying phenomenon of neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease. Misfolding of proteins and peptides, as is the case with Abeta, follows a progression from a monomeric state, through intermediates, ending at long, unbranched amyloid fibers. This tutorial review offers a perspective on the association of toxic Abeta structures with membranes as well as details of membrane-associated mechanisms of toxicity.

24471163|a|The aggregation of amyloid-beta protein (1-42) is studied at experimental concentrations using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations.

24473795|t|Elevated serum pesticide levels and risk for Alzheimer disease.
24473795|a|IMPORTANCE: The causes of late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD) are not yet understood but likely include a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Limited epidemiological studies suggest that occupational pesticide exposures are associated with AD. Previously, we reported that serum levels of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), the metabolite of the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), were elevated in a small number of patients with AD (n=20). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between serum levels of DDE and AD and whether the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype modifies the association. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A case-control study consisting of existing samples from patients with AD and control participants from the Emory University Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School's Alzheimer's Disease Center. Serum levels of DDE were measured in 79 control and 86 AD cases. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Serum DDE levels, AD diagnosis, severity of AD measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination score, and interaction with APOE4 status. RESULTS: Levels of DDE were 3.8-fold higher in the serum of those with AD (mean [SEM], 2.64 [0.35] ng/mg cholesterol) when compared with control participants (mean [SEM], 0.69 [0.1] ng/mg cholesterol; P < .001). The highest tertile of DDE levels was associated with an odds ratio of 4.18 for increased risk for AD (95% CI, 2.54-5.82; P < .001) and lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores (-1.605; range, -3.095 to -0.114; P < .0001). The Mini-Mental State Examination scores in the highest tertile of DDE were -1.753 points lower in the subpopulation carrying an APOE epsilon4 allele compared with those carrying an APOE epsilon3 allele (P interaction = .04). Serum levels of DDE were highly correlated with brain levels of DDE (rho = 0.95). Exposure of human neuroblastoma cells to DDT or DDE increased levels of amyloid precursor protein. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Elevated serum DDE levels are associated with an increased risk for AD and carriers of an APOE4 epsilon4 allele may be more susceptible to the effects of DDE. Both DDT and DDE increase amyloid precursor protein levels, providing mechanistic plausibility for the association of DDE exposure with AD. Identifying people who have elevated levels of DDE and carry an APOE epsilon4 allele may lead to early identification of some cases of AD.

24481173|t|A canine model of Alzheimer's disease generated by overexpressing a mutated human amyloid precursor protein.
24481173|a|Canines are considered the most authentic model for studying multifactorial human diseases, as these animals typically share a common environment with man. Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) technology along with genetic engineering of nuclear donor cells provides a unique opportunity for examining human diseases using transgenic canines. In the present study, we generated transgenic canines that overexpressed the human amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene containing well-characterized familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) mutations. We successfully obtained five out of six live puppies by SCNT. This was confirmed by observing the expression of green fluorescence protein in the body as a visual transgenic marker and the overexpression of the mutated APP gene in the brain. The transgenic canines developed AD-like symptoms, such as enlarged ventricles, an atrophied hippocampus, and beta-amyloid plaques in the brain. Thus, the transgenic canines we created can serve as a novel animal model for studying human AD.

24481566|t|Neuroprotection by the synthetic neurosteroid enantiomers ent-PREGS and ent-DHEAS against Abeta25-35 peptide-induced toxicity in vitro and in vivo in mice.
24481566|a|RATIONALE: Pregnenolone sulfate (PREGS) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) are pro-amnesic, anti-amnesic and neuroprotective steroids in rodents. In Alzheimer's disease (AD) patient's brains, their low concentrations are correlated with high levels of Abeta and tau proteins. The unnatural enantiomer ent-PREGS enhanced memory in rodents. We investigated here whether ent-PREGS and ent-DHEAS could be neuroprotective in AD models. OBJECTIVE: The effects of PREGS, ent-PREGS, DHEAS and ent-DHEAS against Abeta25-35 peptide-induced toxicity were examined in vitro on B104 neuroblastoma cells and in vivo in mice. METHODS: B104 cells pretreated with the steroids before Abeta25-35 were analysed by flow cytometry measuring cell viability and death processes. Mice injected intracerebroventricularly with Abeta25-35 and the steroids were analysed for their memory abilities. Additionally, lipid peroxidation levels in the hippocampus were measured. RESULTS: ent-PREGS and PREGS significantly attenuated the Abeta25-35-induced decrease in cell viability. Both steroids prevented the Abeta25-35-induced increase in late apoptotic cells. PREGS further attenuated the ratio of necrotic cells. ent-DHEAS and DHEAS significantly reduced the Abeta25-35-induced toxicity and prevented the cells from entering late apoptosis and necrosis. All steroids stimulated neurite outgrowth per se and prevented the Abeta25-35-induced decrease. In vivo, ent-PREGS and ent-DHEAS significantly attenuated the Abeta25-35-induced decrease in memory (spontaneous alternation and passive avoidance) and an increase in lipid peroxidation levels. In contrast to the natural steroids, both enantiomers prevented amnesia when injected 6 h before Abeta25-35 in contrast to the natural steroids. CONCLUSION: The unnatural steroids ent-PREGS and ent-DHEAS are potent neuroprotective agents and could be effective therapeutical tools in AD.

24482239|t|MLK3-MKK3/6-P38MAPK cascades following N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation contributes to amyloid-beta peptide-induced apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells.
24482239|a|Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) has been implicated in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. The present study explores the proapoptosis signaling evoked by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in Abeta neurotoxicity. Oligomeric Abeta25-35 incubation resulted in significant apoptosis of neuronal SH-SY5Y cells. Preadministration of the potent NMDA receptor antagonist MK801 promoted neuronal survival. Both NVP-AAM077 and Ro25-6981, GluN2A- and GluN2B-subunit-selective NMDA receptor antagonists, respectively, showed effects similar to those of MK801, supporting a critical role of GluN2A- or GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors in Abeta neurotoxicity. Exposure to oligomeric Abeta25-35 increased the phosphorylation (activation) of mixed-lineage kinase 3 (MLK3), dual-specific mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3/6 (MKK3/6), and P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (P38MAPK) in SH-SY5Y cells. Inhibition of P38MAPK activation by SB239063 had a neuroprotective effect. K252a attenuated the phosphorylation of MLK3, MKK3/6, and P38MAPK but also partially prevented SH-SY5Y cells apoptosis. MK801, NVP-AAM077, and Ro25-6981, abrogated the MLK3-MKK3/6-P38MAPK activation induced by oligomeric Abeta25-35. These results suggest that the activation of GluN2A- or GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors is responsible for the activation of MLK3-MKK3/6-P38MAPK cascades, which contributes to Abeta-mediated cell apoptosis.

24484607|t|Monomeric Abeta1-42 and RAGE: key players in neuronal differentiation.
24484607|a|The aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides plays a crucial role in the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease. Monomeric form of Abeta, indeed, could exert a physiological role. Considering the anti-oligomerization property of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), the involvement of monomeric Abeta1-42 in ATRA-induced neuronal differentiation has been investigated. Four-day ATRA treatment increases beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) level, Abeta1-42 production, and receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) expression. RAGE is a well-recognized receptor for Abeta, and the block of both RAGE and Abeta1-42 with specific antibodies strongly impairs neurite formation in ATRA-treated cells. The involvement of Abeta1-42 and RAGE in ATRA-induced morphologic changes has been confirmed treating undifferentiated cells with different molecular assemblies of peptide: 1 muM monomeric, but not oligomeric, Abeta1-42 increases RAGE expression and favors neurite elongation. The block of RAGE completely prevents this effect. Furthermore, our data underline the involvement of the RAGE-dependent adhesion molecule amphoterin-induced gene and open reading frame-1 as downstream effector of both ATRA and Abeta1-42. In conclusion, our findings identify a novel physiological role for monomeric Abeta1-42 and RAGE in neuronal differentiation.

24485508|a|Immune responses in the brain are thought to play a role in disorders of the central nervous system, but an understanding of the process underlying how immune cells get into the brain and their fate there remains unclear. In this study, we used a 2-photon microscopy to reveal that neutrophils infiltrate brain and migrate toward amyloid plaques in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. These findings suggest a new molecular process underlying the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease.

24491999|t|The dark sides of amyloid in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.
24491999|a|Although widely explored, the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has yet to be cleared. Over the past twenty years the so call amyloid cascade hypothesis represented the main research paradigm in AD pathogenesis. In spite of its large consensus, the proposed role of beta-amyloid (Abeta) remain to be elucidated. Many evidences are starting to cast doubt on Abeta as the primary causative factor in AD. For instance, Abeta is deposited in the brain following many different kinds of injury. Also, concentration of Abeta needed to induce toxicity in vitro are never reached in vivo. In this review we propose an amyloid-independent interpretation of several AD pathogenic features, such as synaptic plasticity, endo-lysosomal trafficking, cell cycle regulation and neuronal survival.

24492349|t|APOE2 enhances neuroprotection against Alzheimer's disease through multiple molecular mechanisms.
24492349|a|The common APOE2 gene variant is neuroprotective against Alzheimer's disease (AD) and reduces risk by nearly 50%. However, the mechanisms by which APOE2 confers neuroprotection are largely unknown. Here we showed that ApoE protein abundance in human postmortem cortex follows an isoform-dependent pattern (E2>E3>E4). We also identified a unique downstream transcriptional profile determined by microarray and characterized by downregulation of long-term potentiation (LTP) related transcripts and upregulation of extracellular matrix (ECM)/integrin-related transcripts in E2 cases and corroborated this finding at the protein level by demonstrating increases in ECM collagens and laminins. In vivo studies of healthy older individuals demonstrated a unique and advantageous biomarker signature in E2 carriers. APOE2 also reduced the risk of mild cognitive impairment to AD conversion by half. Our findings suggest that ApoE2 protein abundance, coupled with its inability to bind to LDLRs, may act to increase amyloid-beta (Ab) clearance. In addition, increased ECM and reduced LTP-related expression results in diminished activity-dependent Ab secretion and/or excitotoxicity, and thus also promotes neuroprotection.

24495404|t|Beta-amyloid associated differential effects of APOE epsilon4 on brain metabolism in cognitively normal elderly.
24495404|a|OBJECTIVE: Although apolipoprotein (APOE) epsilon4 allele is a well-established risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD), the mechanism of its effects on AD pathogenesis is not fully understood. We aimed to investigate the effects of APOE genotype on regional cerebral glucose metabolism in cognitively normal (CN) elderly. We further tried to elucidate whether or not such effects are associated with beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) deposition. METHODS: 31 CN elderly participants underwent clinical examination, a range of neuropsychological tests, APOE genotyping, and Pittsburgh compound-B- and fluorodeoxyglucose-PET scans. RESULTS: 17 APOE epsilon4 carriers and 15 non-carriers were included. Both hypometabolic and hypermetabolic regions were observed in epsilon4 carriers compared with noncarriers when age, education, and sex were controlled. When the degree of global cerebral Abeta deposition was adjusted, the hypometabolic regions in the temporo-parietal area (i.e., BA 22 and 39) largely disappeared, whereas the hypermetabolic regions persisted in medial frontal and anterior temporal areas (i.e., BA 38, 11, and 39). Behaviorally, verbal episodic memory scores of APOE epsilon4 carriers were slightly lower than those of noncarriers, though still within normal range. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that decreased cerebral glucose metabolism in the temporoparietal junction associated with APOE epsilon4 in CN elderly appears to be mediated by Abeta deposition, and the effect of APOE epsilon4 on hypermetabolism in the frontal and anterior temporal regions is independent of Abeta and may be associated with presence of compensatory mechanism in CN elderly with the epsilon4 allele.

24496070|t|Proteomic analysis of serum proteins in triple transgenic Alzheimer's disease mice: implications for identifying biomarkers for use to screen potential candidate therapeutic drugs for early Alzheimer's disease.
24496070|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common fatal neurodegenerative disease affecting the elderly worldwide. There is an urgent need to identify novel biomarkers of early AD. This study aims to search for potential early protein biomarkers in serum from a triple transgenic (PS1M146V/APPSwe/TauP301L) mouse model. Proteomic analysis via two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis was performed on serum samples from wild-type (WT) and triple transgenic mice that were treated with or without coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) (800 mg/kg body weight/day), a powerful endogenous antioxidant displaying therapeutic benefits against AD pathology and cognitive impairment in multiple AD mouse models, for a period of three months beginning at two months of age. A total of 15 differentially expressed serum proteins were identified between the WT and AD transgenic mice. The administration of CoQ10 was found to alter the changes in the differentially expressed serum proteins by upregulating 10 proteins and down-regulating 10 proteins. Among the proteins modulated by CoQ10, clusterin and alpha-2-macroglobulin were validated via ELISA assay. These findings revealed significant changes in serum proteins in the AD mouse model at an early pathological stage and demonstrated that administration of CoQ10 could modulate these changes in serum proteins. Our study suggested that these differentially expressed serum proteins could serve as potential protein biomarkers of early AD and that screening for potential candidate AD therapeutic drugs and monitoring of therapeutic effects could be performed via measurement of the changes in these differentially expressed serum proteins.

24496074|t|Altered expression of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor in the triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
24496074|a|The endocannabinoid system has gained much attention as a new potential pharmacotherapeutic target in various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the association between CB1 alterations and the development of AD neuropathology is unclear and often contradictory. In this study, brain CB1 mRNA and CB1 protein levels were analyzed in 3 x Tg-AD mice and compared to wild-type littermates at 2, 6 and 12 months of age, using in-situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Semiquantitative analysis of CB1 expression focused on the prefrontal cortex (PFC), prelimbic cortex, dorsal hippocampus (DH), basolateral amygdala complex (BLA), and ventral hippocampus (VH), all areas with high CB1 densities that are strongly affected by neuropathology in 3 x Tg-AD mice. At 2 months of age, there was no change in CB1 mRNA and protein levels in 3 x Tg-AD mice compared to Non-Tg mice in all brain areas analyzed. However, at 6 and 12 months of age, CB1 mRNA levels were significantly higher in PFC, DH, and BLA, and lower in VH in 3 x Tg-AD mice compared to wild-type littermates. CB1 immunohistochemistry revealed that CB1 protein expression was unchanged in 3 x Tg-AD at 2 and 6 months of age, while a significant decrease in CB1 receptor immunoreactivity was detected in the BLA and DH of 12-month-old 3 x Tg-AD mice, with no sign of alteration in other brain areas. The altered CB1 levels appear, rather, to be age-and/or pathology-dependent, indicating an involvement of the endocannabinoid system in AD pathology and supporting the ECS as a potential novel therapeutic target for treatment of AD.

24496075|t|Personal memory function in mild cognitive impairment and subjective memory complaints: results from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers, and Lifestyle (AIBL) Study of Ageing.
24496075|a|BACKGROUND: Autobiographical memory (ABM) refers to the recollection of individual experiences, while personal semantic memory (PSM) refers to personally relevant, but shared, facts. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is routinely diagnosed with the aid of neuropsychological tests, which do not tap the ABM and PSM domains. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to characterize the nature of ABM and PSM retrieval in cognitively healthy (HC) memory complainers, non-memory complainers, and MCI participants, and to investigate the relationship between neuropsychological tests and personal memory. METHODS: Gender- and education-matched participants (HC = 80 and MCI = 43) completed the Episodic ABM Interview (EAMI) and a battery of neuropsychological tests. RESULTS: ABM and PSM did not differ between complainers and non-complainers, but were poorer in MCI participants, after accounting for age and depressive symptomatology. There were significant associations between personal memory and objective memory measures were found in MCI participants, but standard cognitive measures were more sensitive to MCI. CONCLUSION: Personal memory was compromised in MCI, reflected by lower scores on the EAMI. Memory complaining, assessed by current approaches, did not have an impact on personal memory. Standard subjective questionnaires might not reflect the sorts of concerns that bring individuals to clinical attention. Understanding personal memory function in the elderly may aid in the development of a more sensitive measure of subjective memory concerns.

24497505|t|Transcriptome analysis of distinct mouse strains reveals kinesin light chain-1 splicing as an amyloid-beta accumulation modifier.
24497505|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta). The genes that govern this process, however, have remained elusive. To this end, we combined distinct mouse strains with transcriptomics to directly identify disease-relevant genes. We show that AD model mice (APP-Tg) with DBA/2 genetic backgrounds have significantly lower levels of Abeta accumulation compared with SJL and C57BL/6 mice. We then applied brain transcriptomics to reveal the genes in DBA/2 that suppress Abeta accumulation. To avoid detecting secondarily affected genes by Abeta, we used non-Tg mice in the absence of Abeta pathology and selected candidate genes differently expressed in DBA/2 mice. Additional transcriptome analysis of APP-Tg mice with mixed genetic backgrounds revealed kinesin light chain-1 (Klc1) as an Abeta modifier, indicating a role for intracellular trafficking in Abeta accumulation. Abeta levels correlated with the expression levels of Klc1 splice variant E and the genotype of Klc1 in these APP-Tg mice. In humans, the expression levels of KLC1 variant E in brain and lymphocyte were significantly higher in AD patients compared with unaffected individuals. Finally, functional analysis using neuroblastoma cells showed that overexpression or knockdown of KLC1 variant E increases or decreases the production of Abeta, respectively. The identification of KLC1 variant E suggests that the dysfunction of intracellular trafficking is a causative factor of Abeta pathology. This unique combination of distinct mouse strains and model mice with transcriptomics is expected to be useful for the study of genetic mechanisms of other complex diseases.

24499793|t|FKBP12 regulates the localization and processing of amyloid precursor protein in human cell lines.
24499793|a|One of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease is the presence of insoluble extracellular amyloid plaques. These plaques are mainly constituted of amyloid beta peptide (A beta), a proteolytic product of amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP processing also generates the APP intracellular domain (AICD). We have previously demonstrated that AICD interacts with FKBP12, a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) ubiquitous in nerve systems. This interaction was interfered by FK506, a clinically used immunosuppressant that has recently been reported to be neuroprotective. To elucidate the roles of FKBP12 in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, the effect of FKBP12 overexpression on APP processing was evaluated. Our results revealed that APP processing was shifted towards the amyloidogenic pathway, accompanied by a change in the subcellular localization of APP, upon FKBP12 overexpression. This FKBP12-overexpression-induced effect was reverted by FK506. These findings support our hypothesis that FKBP12 may participate in the regulation of APP processing. FKBP12 overexpression may lead to the stabilization of a certain isomer (presumably the cis form) of the Thr668-Pro669 peptide bond in AICD, therefore change its affinity to flotillin-1 or other raft-associated proteins, and eventually change the localization pattern and cause a shift in the proteolytic processing of APP.

24499794|t|Three-dimensional analysis of abnormal ultrastructural alteration in mitochondria of hippocampus of APP/PSEN1 transgenic mouse.
24499794|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. The deterioration of subcellular organelles, including the mitochondria, is another major ultrastructural characteristic of AD pathogenesis, in addition to amyloid plaque deposition. However, the three-dimensional (3-D) study of mitochondrial structural alteration in AD remains poorly understood. Therefore, ultrastructural analysis, 3-D electron tomography, and immunogold electron microscopy were performed in the present study to clarify the abnormal structural alterations in mitochondria caused by the progression of AD in APP/PSEN1 transgenic mice, expressing human amyloid precursor protein, as a model for AD. Amyloid beta (A beta) plaques accumulated and dystrophic neurites (DN) developed in the hippocampus of transgenic AD mouse brains. We also identified the loss of peroxiredoxin 3, an endogenous cytoprotective antioxidant enzyme and the accumulation of A beta in the hippocampal mitochondria of transgenic mice, which differs from those in age-matched wild-type mice. The mitochondria in A beta plaque-detected regions were severely disrupted, and the patterns of ultrastructural abnormalities were classified into three groups: disappearance of cristae, swelling of cristae, and bulging of the outer membrane. These results demonstrated that morpho-functional alterations of mitochondria and AD progression are closely associated and may be beneficial in investigating the function of mitochondria in AD pathogenesis.

24502657|t|Two-photon and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy as probes for structural determination in amyloid-beta peptides and aggregates.
24502657|a|The development of new sensitive methods for the detailed collection of conformational and morphological information about amyloids is crucial for the elucidation of critical questions regarding aggregation processes in neurodegenerative diseases. The combined approach of two-photon and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy described in this report interrogates the early conformational dynamics seen in soluble oligomers of amyloid-beta(1-42). Concentration-dependent aggregation studies using two-photon absorption show enhanced sensitivity toward conformational changes taking place in the secondary structure of the amyloid peptide as aggregation proceeds. Fluorescence lifetimes and changes in anisotropy values indicate Forster-type energy transfer occurring as a function of aggregation state. The sensitivity of our two-photon methodology is compared to that of circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, and the results indicate that the two-photon absorption cross-section method exhibits superior sensitivity. A theoretical model is developed that, together with electronic structure calculations, explains the change in cross section as a function of aggregation in terms of interacting transition dipoles for aggregates showing stacked or parallel structures. This suggests that the two-photon method provides a sensitive alternative to CD spectroscopy while avoiding many of the inherent challenges particular to CD data collection. The implication of this finding is significant, as it indicates that a two-photon-based technique used in conjunction with time-resolved fluorescence might be able to reveal answers to conformational questions about amyloid-beta(1-42) that are presently inaccessible with other techniques.

24503167|t|Ginsenoside Rg5 improves cognitive dysfunction and beta-amyloid deposition in STZ-induced memory impaired rats via attenuating neuroinflammatory responses.
24503167|a|Neuroinflammatory responses play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Ginsenoside Rg5 (Rg5), an abundant natural compound in Panax ginseng, has been found to be beneficial in treating AD. In the present study, we demonstrated that Rg5 improved cognitive dysfunction and attenuated neuroinflammatory responses in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced memory impaired rats. Cognitive deficits were ameliorated with Rg5 (5, 10 and 20mg/kg) treatment in a dose-dependent manner together with decreased levels of inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1beta (P<0.05) in brains of STZ rats. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was also significantly reduced by Rg5 whereas choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity was remarkably increased in the cortex and hippocampus of STZ-induced AD rats (P<0.05). In addition, Congo red and immunohistochemistry staining results showed that Rg5 alleviated Abeta deposition but enhanced the expressions of insulin-like growth factors 1 (IGF-1) and brain derived neurophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex (P<0.05). Western blot analysis also demonstrated that Rg5 increased remarkably BDNF and IGF-1 expressions whereas decreased significantly Abeta deposits (P<0.05). Furthermore, it was observed that the expressions of COX-2 and iNOS were significantly up-regulated in STZ-induced AD rats and down-regulated strongly (P<0.05) by Rg5 compared with control rats. These data demonstrated that STZ-induced learning and memory impairments in rats could be improved by Rg5, which was associated with attenuating neuroinflammatory responses. Our findings suggested that Rg5 could be a beneficial agent for the treatment of AD.

24503618|t|Differential changes in Abeta42 and Abeta40 with age.
24503618|a|Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), the cerebral accumulation of which is thought to cause Alzheimer's disease (AD), is produced throughout life. The level of insoluble Abeta rises with age and is further increased in AD. In contrast, we showed previously that in mid-frontal cortex in a cohort without neurological disease, soluble Abeta declined progressively between 16 and 95 y. We speculated that the divergent changes in the levels of soluble and insoluble Abeta with age might reflect an increasing tendency to favor the production or retention within the brain of Abeta42 over Abeta40, leading to elevation of Abeta(42:40) even as total soluble Abeta decreased. We have now measured Abeta40 and Abeta42 in soluble and insoluble (guanidine-extractable) fractions of human postmortem brain tissue from the same cohort studied previously. Although in normal brains the absolute level of Abeta40 in both soluble and insoluble fractions and that of Abeta42 in the soluble fraction declined with age, those declines were predominantly before about 50 y, after which Abeta(42:40) tended to increase in both the soluble and insoluble fractions. Insoluble Abeta42 increased progressively with age. Differential production or retention of Abeta40 and Abeta42 in the over-50 s is likely to contribute to the influence of age on the risk of sporadic AD.

24503620|t|Posttranslational nitro-glycative modifications of albumin in Alzheimer's disease: implications in cytotoxicity and amyloid-beta peptide aggregation.
24503620|a|Glycation and nitrotyrosination are pathological posttranslational modifications that make proteins prone to losing their physiological properties. Since both modifications are increased in Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) accumulation, we have studied their effect on albumin, the most abundant protein in cerebrospinal fluid and blood. Brain and plasmatic levels of glycated and nitrated albumin were significantly higher in AD patients than in controls. In vitro turbidometry and electron microscopy analyses demonstrated that glycation and nitrotyrosination promote changes in albumin structure and biochemical properties. Glycated albumin was more resistant to proteolysis and less uptake by hepatoma cells occurred. Glycated albumin also reduced the osmolarity expected for a solution containing native albumin. Both glycation and nitrotyrosination turned albumin cytotoxic in a cell type-dependent manner for cerebral and vascular cells. Finally, of particular relevance to AD, these modified albumins were significantly less effective in avoiding Abeta aggregation than native albumin. In summary, nitrotyrosination and especially glycation alter albumin structural and biochemical properties, and these modifications might contribute for the progression of AD.

24508314|t|Alzheimer's disease susceptibility genes APOE and TOMM40, and brain white matter integrity in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936.
24508314|a|Apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon genotype has previously been significantly associated with cognitive, brain imaging, and Alzheimer's disease-related phenotypes (e.g., age of onset). In the TOMM40 gene, the rs10524523 ("523") variable length poly-T repeat polymorphism has more recently been associated with similar ph/enotypes, although the allelic directions of these associations have varied between initial reports. Using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging tractography, the present study aimed to investigate whether there are independent effects of apolipoprotein E (APOE) and TOMM40 genotypes on human brain white matter integrity in a community-dwelling sample of older adults, the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (mean age = 72.70 years, standard deviation = 0.74, N approximately = 640-650; for most analyses). Some nominally significant effects were observed (i.e., covariate-adjusted differences between genotype groups at p < 0.05). For APOE, deleterious effects of epsilon4 "risk" allele presence (vs. absence) were found in the right ventral cingulum and left inferior longitudinal fasciculus. To test for biologically independent effects of the TOMM40 523 repeat, participants were stratified into APOE genotype subgroups, so that any significant effects could not be attributed to APOE variation. In participants with the APOE epsilon3/epsilon4 genotype, effects of TOMM40 523 status were found in the left uncinate fasciculus, left rostral cingulum, left ventral cingulum, and a general factor of white matter integrity. In all 4 of these tractography measures, carriers of the TOMM40 523 "short" allele showed lower white matter integrity when compared with carriers of the "long" and "very-long" alleles. Most of these effects survived correction for childhood intelligence test scores and vascular disease history, though only the effect of TOMM40 523 on the left ventral cingulum integrity survived correction for false discovery rate. The effects of APOE in this older population are more specific and restricted compared with those reported in previous studies, and the effects of TOMM40 on white matter integrity appear to be novel, although replication is required in large independent samples.

24508800|t|Leptin inhibits amyloid beta-protein degradation through decrease of neprilysin expression in primary cultured astrocytes.
24508800|a|Pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by accumulation of extracellular deposits of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) in the brain. The steady state level of Abeta in the brain is determined by the balance between its production and removal; the latter occurring through egress across blood and CSF barriers as well as Abeta degradation. The major Abeta-degrading enzymes in the brain are neprilysin (NEP) and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), which may promote Abeta deposition in patients with sporadic late-onset AD. Epidemiological studies have suggested an inverse relationship between the adipocytokine leptin levels and the onset of AD. However, the mechanisms underlying the relationship remain uncertain. We investigated whether leptin is associated with Abeta degradation by inducing NEP and IDE expression within primary cultured astrocytes. Leptin significantly decreased the expression of NEP but not IDE in a concentration- and time-dependent manner through the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in cultured rat astrocytes. Furthermore, leptin inhibited the degradation of exogenous Abeta in primary cultured astrocytes. These results suggest that leptin suppresses Abeta degradation by NEP through activation of ERK.

24509156|t|Ceruloplasmin and beta-amyloid precursor protein confer neuroprotection in traumatic brain injury and lower neuronal iron.
24509156|a|Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is in part complicated by pro-oxidant iron elevation independent of brain hemorrhage. Ceruloplasmin (CP) and beta-amyloid protein precursor (APP) are known neuroprotective proteins that reduce oxidative damage through iron regulation. We surveyed iron, CP, and APP in brain tissue from control and TBI-affected patients who were stratified according to time of death following injury. We observed CP and APP induction after TBI accompanying iron accumulation. Elevated APP and CP expression was also observed in a mouse model of focal cortical contusion injury concomitant with iron elevation. To determine if changes in APP or CP were neuroprotective we employed the same TBI model on APP(-/-) and CP(-/-) mice and found that both exhibited exaggerated infarct volume and iron accumulation postinjury. Evidence supports a regulatory role of both proteins in defence against iron-induced oxidative damage after TBI, which presents as a tractable therapeutic target.

24514874|t|In vivo evaluation of a novel tau imaging tracer for Alzheimer's disease.
24514874|a|PURPOSE: Diagnosis of tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) still relies on post-mortem examination of the human brain. A non-invasive method of determining brain tau burden in vivo would allow a better understanding of the pathophysiology of tauopathies. The purpose of the study was to evaluate (18)F-THK523 as a potential tau imaging tracer. METHODS: Ten healthy elderly controls, three semantic dementia (SD) and ten AD patients underwent neuropsychological examination, MRI as well as (18)F-THK523 and (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Composite memory and non-memory scores, global and hippocampal brain volume, and partial volume-corrected tissue ratios for (18)F-THK523 and (11)C-PIB were estimated for all participants. Correlational analyses were performed between global and regional (18)F-THK523, (11)C-PIB, cognition and brain volumetrics. RESULTS: (18)F-THK523 presented with fast reversible kinetics. Significantly higher (18)F-THK523 retention was observed in the temporal, parietal, orbitofrontal and hippocampi of AD patients when compared to healthy controls and SD patients. White matter retention was significantly higher than grey matter retention in all participants. The pattern of cortical (18)F-THK523 retention did not correlate with Abeta distribution as assessed by (11)C-PIB and followed the known distribution of tau in the AD brain, being higher in temporal and parietal areas than in the frontal region. Unlike (11)C-PIB, hippocampal (18)F-THK523 retention was correlated with several cognitive parameters and with hippocampal atrophy. CONCLUSION: (18)F-THK523 does not bind to Abeta in vivo, while following the known distribution of paired helical filaments (PHF)-tau in the brain. Significantly higher cortical (18)F-THK523 retention in AD patients as well as the association of hippocampal (18)F-THK523 retention with cognitive parameters and hippocampal volume suggests (18)F-THK523 selectively binds to tau in AD patients. Unfortunately, the very high (18)F-THK523 retention in white matter precludes simple visual inspection of the images, preventing its use in research or clinical settings.

24517534|t|Amyloid-beta concentration and structure influences the transport and immunomodulatory effects of IVIG.
24517534|a|Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) contains anti-amyloid-beta antibodies as well as antibodies providing immunomodulatory effects that may modify chronic inflammation in Alzheimer's disease. Answers to important questions about IVIG transport into the central nervous system and assessments of any impact amyloid-beta has on this transport can be provided by in vitro models of the blood-brain barrier. In this study, amyloid-beta[1-42] was pre-aggregated into fibrillar or oligomeric structures, and various concentrations were incubated in the brain side of the blood-brain barrier model, followed by IVIG administration in the blood side at the therapeutically relevant concentrations of 5 and 20 mg/mL. IVIG accumulated in the brain side at physiologically relevant levels, with amyloid-beta pre-incubation increasing IVIG accumulation. The increased transport effect was dependent on amyloid-beta structural form, amyloid-beta concentration, and IVIG dose. IVIG was found to decrease monocyte chemotactic protein-1 levels 6.5-18% when low amyloid-beta levels were present and increase levels 4.2-23% when high amyloid-beta levels were present. Therefore, the presence, concentration, and structure of amyloid-beta plays an important role in the effect of IVIG therapy in the brain. The mechanisms of action and transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) for an Alzheimer's disease therapeutic, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), remain unknown. We investigated the transport of IVIG across endothelial cell BBB monolayers pre-incubated with amyloid-beta peptides. We found that the concentration and structure of amyloid-beta plays an important role in the effect of IVIG on BBB tightening and cytokine neutralization. (Note: Figure not drawn to scale.).

24519981|t|High molecular mass assemblies of amyloid-beta oligomers bind prion protein in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
24519981|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia and the generation of oligomeric species of amyloid-beta is causal to the initiation and progression of it. Amyloid-beta oligomers bind to the N-terminus of plasma membrane-bound cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) initiating a series of events leading to synaptic degeneration. Composition of bound amyloid-beta oligomers, binding regions within PrP(C), binding affinities and modifiers of this interaction have been almost exclusively studied in cell culture or murine models of Alzheimer's disease and our knowledge on PrP(C)-amyloid-beta interaction in patients with Alzheimer's disease is limited regarding occurrence, binding regions in PrP(C), and size of bound amyloid-beta oligomers. Here we employed a PrP(C)-amyloid-beta binding assay and size exclusion chromatography on neuropathologically characterized Alzheimer's disease and non-demented control brains (n = 15, seven female, eight male, average age: 79.2 years for Alzheimer's disease and n = 10, three female, seven male, average age: 66.4 years for controls) to investigate amyloid-beta-PrP(C) interaction. PrP(C)-amyloid-beta binding always occurred in Alzheimer's disease brains and was never detected in non-demented controls. Neither expression level of PrP(C) nor known genetic modifiers of Alzheimer's disease, such as the PrP(C) codon 129 polymorphism, influenced this interaction. In Alzheimer's disease brains, binding of amyloid-beta to PrP(C) occurred via the PrP(C) N-terminus. For synthetic amyloid-beta42, small oligomeric species showed prominent binding to PrP(C), whereas in Alzheimer's disease brains larger protein assemblies containing amyloid-beta42 bound efficiently to PrP(C). These data confirm Alzheimer's disease specificity of binding of amyloid-beta to PrP(C) via its N-terminus in a large cohort of Alzheimer's disease/control brains. Differences in sizes of separated protein fractions between synthetic and brain-derived amyloid-beta binding to PrP(C) suggest that larger assemblies of amyloid-beta or additional non-amyloid-beta components may play a role in binding of amyloid-beta42 to PrP(C) in Alzheimer's disease.

24519982|t|Biochemical stages of amyloid-beta peptide aggregation and accumulation in the human brain and their association with symptomatic and pathologically preclinical Alzheimer's disease.
24519982|a|Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the deposition of amyloid-beta peptide in the brain. N-terminal truncation resulting in the formation of AbetaN3pE and phosphorylation at serine 8 have been reported to modify aggregation properties of amyloid-beta. Biochemically, soluble, dispersible, membrane-associated, and insoluble, plaque-associated amyloid-beta aggregates have been distinguished. Soluble and dispersible amyloid-beta aggregates are both in mixture with the extracellular or intracellular fluid but dispersible aggregates can be cleared from proteins in solution by ultracentrifugation. To clarify the role of phosphorylated amyloid-beta and AbetaN3pE in soluble, dispersible, membrane-associated, and plaque-associated amyloid-beta aggregates in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease we studied brains from 21 cases with symptomatic Alzheimer's disease, 33 pathologically preclinical Alzheimer's disease cases, and 20 control cases. Western blot analysis showed that soluble, dispersible, membrane-associated and plaque-associated amyloid-beta aggregates in the earliest preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease did not exhibit detectable amounts of AbetaN3pE and phosphorylated amyloid-beta. This stage was referred to as biochemical stage 1 of amyloid-beta aggregation and accumulation. In biochemical amyloid-beta stage 2, AbetaN3pE was additionally found whereas phosphorylated amyloid-beta was restricted to biochemical amyloid-beta stage 3, the last stage of amyloid-beta aggregation. Phosphorylated amyloid-beta was seen in the dispersible, membrane-associated, and plaque-associated fraction. All cases with symptomatic Alzheimer's disease in our sample fulfilled biochemical amyloid-beta stage 3 criteria, i.e. detection of phosphorylated amyloid-beta. Most, but not all, cases with pathologically preclinical Alzheimer's disease had biochemical amyloid-beta stages 1 or 2. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the hierarchical occurrence of amyloid-beta, AbetaN3pE, and phosphorylated amyloid-beta in amyloid plaques. Phosphorylated amyloid-beta containing plaques were, thereby, seen in all symptomatic cases with Alzheimer's disease but only in a few non-demented control subjects. The biochemical amyloid-beta stages correlated with the expansion of amyloid-beta plaque deposition and with that of neurofibrillary tangle pathology. Taken together, we demonstrate that AbetaN3pE and phosphorylated amyloid-beta are not only detectable in plaques, but also in soluble and dispersible amyloid-beta aggregates outside of plaques. They occur in a hierarchical sequence that allows the distinction of three stages. In light of our findings, it is tempting to speculate that this hierarchical, biochemical sequence of amyloid-beta aggregation and accumulation is related to disease progression and may be relevant for an increasing toxicity of amyloid-beta aggregates.

24523320|t|Lysosomal sorting of amyloid-beta by the SORLA receptor is impaired by a familial Alzheimer's disease mutation.
24523320|a|SORLA/SORL1 is a unique neuronal sorting receptor for the amyloid precursor protein that has been causally implicated in both sporadic and autosomal dominant familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Brain concentrations of SORLA are inversely correlated with amyloid-beta (Abeta) in mouse models and AD patients, suggesting that increasing expression of this receptor could be a therapeutic option for decreasing the amount of amyloidogenic products in affected individuals. We characterize a new mouse model in which SORLA is overexpressed, and show a decrease in Abeta concentrations in mouse brain. We trace the underlying molecular mechanism to the ability of this receptor to direct lysosomal targeting of nascent Abeta peptides. Abeta binds to the amino-terminal VPS10P domain of SORLA, and this binding is impaired by a familial AD mutation in SORL1. Thus, loss of SORLA's Abeta sorting function is a potential cause of AD in patients, and SORLA may be a new therapeutic target for AD drug development.

24524897|t|The familial Alzheimer's disease APPV717I mutation alters APP processing and Tau expression in iPSC-derived neurons.
24524897|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by extracellular plaques containing amyloid beta (Abeta)-protein and intracellular tangles containing hyperphosphorylated Tau protein. Here, we describe the generation of inducible pluripotent stem cell lines from patients harboring the London familial AD (fAD) amyloid precursor protein (APP) mutation (V717I). We examine AD-relevant phenotypes following directed differentiation to forebrain neuronal fates vulnerable in AD. We observe that over differentiation time to mature neuronal fates, APP expression and levels of Abeta increase dramatically. In both immature and mature neuronal fates, the APPV717I mutation affects both beta- and gamma-secretase cleavage of APP. Although the mutation lies near the gamma-secretase cleavage site in the transmembrane domain of APP, we find that beta-secretase cleavage of APP is elevated leading to generation of increased levels of both APPsbeta and Abeta. Furthermore, we find that this mutation alters the initial cleavage site of gamma-secretase, resulting in an increased generation of both Abeta42 and Abeta38. In addition to altered APP processing, an increase in levels of total and phosphorylated Tau is observed in neurons with the APPV717I mutation. We show that treatment with Abeta-specific antibodies early in culture reverses the phenotype of increased total Tau levels, implicating altered Abeta production in fAD neurons in this phenotype. These studies use human neurons to reveal previously unrecognized effects of the most common fAD APP mutation and provide a model system for testing therapeutic strategies in the cell types most relevant to disease processes.

24526746|t|Anxiety symptoms, cerebral amyloid burden and memory decline in healthy older adults without dementia: 3-year prospective cohort study.
24526746|a|Although beta-amyloid, anxiety and depression have linked cross-sectionally to reduced memory function in healthy older adults without dementia, prospective data evaluating these associations are lacking. Using data an observational cohort study of 178 healthy older adults without dementia followed for 3 years, we found that anxiety symptoms significantly moderated the relationship between beta-amyloid level and decline in verbal (Cohen's d = 0.65) and episodic (Cohen's d = 0.38) memory. Anxiety symptoms were additionally linked to greater decline in executive function, irrespective of beta-amyloid and other risk factors. These findings suggest that interventions to mitigate anxiety symptoms may help delay memory decline in otherwise healthy older adults with elevated beta-amyloid.

24528201|t|The Abeta-clearance protein transthyretin, like neprilysin, is epigenetically regulated by the amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain.
24528201|a|Proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the successive actions of beta- and gamma-secretases generates several biologically active metabolites including the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) and the APP intracellular domain (AICD). By analogy with the Notch signalling pathway, AICD has been proposed to play a role in transcriptional regulation. Among the cohort of genes regulated by AICD is the Abeta-degrading enzyme neprilysin (NEP). AICD binds to the NEP promoter causing transcriptional activation by competitive replacement with histone deacetylases (HDACs) leading to increased levels of NEP activity and hence increased Abeta clearance. We now show that the Abeta-clearance protein transthyretin (TTR) is also epigenetically up-regulated by AICD. Like NEP regulation, AICD derived specifically from the neuronal APP isoform, APP695 , binds directly to the TTR promoter displacing HDAC1 and HDAC3. Cell treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor Gleevec (imatinib) or with the alkalizing agent NH4 Cl causes an accumulation of 'functional' AICD capable of up-regulating both TTR and NEP, leading to a reduction in total cellular Abeta levels. Pharmacological regulation of both NEP and TTR might represent a viable therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease.

24529152|t|Serum vaspin levels are positively associated with carotid atherosclerosis in a general population.
24529152|a|OBJECTIVES: Vaspin is a novel adipocytokine with potential insulin-sensitizing properties. Insulin resistance (IR) plays a role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. However, the relationship between serum vaspin levels and atherosclerosis remains unknown. Therefore, we investigated whether vaspin was correlated with carotid intima-media thickness (c-IMT). METHODS: Data for fasting vaspin levels of 201 subjects (78 men and 123 women aged over 40 years) were obtained from a general population in Japan. We obtained anthropometric parameters and blood chemistries, and calculated homeostasis model assessment-IR (HOMA-IR) index. C-IMT was measured by B-mode ultrasonography. The mean values of each parameter by tertiles of vaspin were compared with analysis of variance, and the associations of vaspin with IR and c-IMT were evaluated by multiple stepwise regression analysis. RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed that vaspin levels were positively correlated with BMI, insulin, HOMA-IR index, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), c-IMT and hypertensive medication. Multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed that HOMA-IR index, c-IMT and eGFR were significantly and independently associated with vaspin. We performed multivariate analyses with c-IMT as the dependent variable. Age, hypertensive medication and vaspin were significant for c-IMT. Moreover, a mediation analysis demonstrated that vaspin was significantly related to c-IMT, independently of IR. CONCLUSIONS: The present study not only confirmed the previous finding of the positive association of vaspin with IR but also demonstrated that serum vaspin level was positively associated with c-IMT, independently of IR in a general population. Our results may suggest a role of vaspin in atherosclerosis in humans.

24529499|t|Investigation of an amyloid precursor protein protective mutation (A673T) in a North American case-control sample of late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
24529499|a|A rare amyloid precursor protein gene variant, A673T (rs63750847) was recently reported to protect against Alzheimer's disease and age-related cognitive decline among Icelanders and the same rare variant was observed also in Finnish, Norwegian, and Swedish populations. We investigated this variant in 1674 late-onset Alzheimer's disease cases and 2644 elderly control subjects, all North American Whites (US Whites). We did not observe any example of the A673T variant in our large sample. Our findings suggest that this rare variant could be specific to the individuals of the origin from the Nordic countries.

24530026|t|Lessons from a BACE1 inhibitor trial: off-site but not off base.
24530026|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by formation of neuritic plaque primarily composed of a small filamentous protein called amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta). The rate-limiting step in the production of Abeta is the processing of Abeta precursor protein (APP) by beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE1). Hence, BACE1 activity plausibly plays a rate-limiting role in the generation of potentially toxic Abeta within brain and the development of AD, thereby making it an interesting drug target. A phase II trial of the promising LY2886721 inhibitor of BACE1 was suspended in June 2013 by Eli Lilly and Co., due to possible liver toxicity. This outcome was apparently a surprise to the study's team, particularly since BACE1 knockout mice and mice treated with the drug did not show such liver toxicity. Lilly proposed that the problem was not due to LY2886721 anti-BACE1 activity. We offer an alternative hypothesis, whereby anti-BACE1 activity may induce apparent hepatotoxicity through inhibiting BACE1's processing of beta-galactoside alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase I (STGal6 I). In knockout mice, paralogues, such as BACE2 or cathepsin D, could partially compensate. Furthermore, the short duration of animal studies and short lifespan of study animals could mask effects that would require several decades to accumulate in humans. Inhibition of hepatic BACE1 activity in middle-aged humans would produce effects not detectable in mice. We present a testable model to explain the off-target effects of LY2886721 and highlight more broadly that so-called off-target drug effects might actually represent off-site effects that are not necessarily off-target. Consideration of this concept in forthcoming drug design, screening, and testing programs may prevent such failures in the future.

24531159|t|Stimulation of autophagy prevents amyloid-beta peptide-induced neuritic degeneration in PC12 cells.
24531159|a|Autophagy is a lysosomal degradative process essential for neuronal homeostasis, whereas autophagic failure has been linked to accumulating neurodegenerative disorders. However, the precise role of autophagy in axonal and dendritic degeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear. In this study, we aim to investigate the precise effect of autophagy in amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta)25-35-mediated neurite degeneration. Abeta35-25, the non-neurotoxic reverse sequence analogue of Abeta25-35, was used as a negative control. Our results showed that Abeta25-35 dose-dependently suppressed PC12 proliferation and induced autophagy induction in neurites (axons and dendrites). A high proportion of autophagic structures in PC12 neurites were autolysosomes after 24 h of Abeta25-35 treatment. Autophagy inhibition by 3-methyladenine (3MA), LY294002, and chloroquine (CQ) could not relieve the Abeta25-35-induced neurite degeneration, while administration of autophagy stimulator rapamycin or AR-12 efficiently suppressed neurite degeneration. Autophagosomes colocalized with fragmented mitochondria after Abeta25-35 treatment. Similar results were obtained using in vitro cultured superior cervical ganglion neurons. These findings demonstrate that autophagy stimulation may prevent neuritic degeneration following Abeta25-35 treatment. Upregulation of autophagic activity may provide a valuable approach for the treatment of axonal and dendritic dystrophy in AD patients.

24531160|t|Synaptic and sub-synaptic localization of amyloid-beta protein precursor in the rat hippocampus.
24531160|a|Amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) is a large transmembrane protein highly expressed in the central nervous system and cleavage of it can produce amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) involved in synaptic dysfunction and loss associated with cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Surprisingly, little is known about the synaptic and sub-synaptic distribution of AbetaPP in different types of nerve terminals. We used total, synaptic, sub-synaptic, and astrocytic membrane preparations obtained from the hippocampus of adult rats to define the localization of AbetaPP, using two different antibodies against different AbetaPP epitopes. Western blot analysis revealed that AbetaPP was not significantly enriched in synaptosomal as compared to total membranes. Within synapses, AbetaPP immunoreactivity was more abundant in pre- (60 +- 4%) than post- (30 +- 5%) or extra-synaptic fractions (10 +- 2%). Immunocytochemical analysis of purified nerve terminals indicated that AbetaPP was more frequently associated with glutamatergic (present in 31 +- 4% of glutamatergic terminals) rather than with GABAergic (16 +- 3%) or cholinergic terminals (4 +- 1%, n = 4). We also observed a general lack of co-localization of AbetaPP and GFAP immunoreactivities in the hippocampus of sections of adult rat brain, albeit we could detect the presence of AbetaPP in gliosomes (vesicular specializations of astrocytic membranes), suggesting that AbetaPP has a heterogeneous localization restricted to certain regions of astrocytes. These results provide the first direct demonstration that AbetaPP is mostly distributed among glutamatergic rather than GABAergic or cholinergic terminals of the adult rat hippocampus, in remarkable agreement with the particular susceptibility to dysfunction and degeneration of glutamatergic synapses in early AD.

24531886|t|Neurofibrillary tangle formation by introducing wild-type human tau into APP transgenic mice.
24531886|a|Senile plaques comprised of Abeta aggregates and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau filaments are the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A number of amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic (Tg) mice harboring APP mutations have been generated as animal models of AD. These mice successfully display amyloid plaque formation and subsequent tau hyperphosphorylation, but seldom induce NFT formations. We have demonstrated that the APPOSK-Tg mice, which possess the E693Delta (Osaka) mutation in APP and thereby accumulate Abeta oligomers without plaques, exhibit tau hyperphosphorylation at 8 months, but not NFT formation even at 24 months. We assumed that APP-Tg mice, including ours, failed to form NFTs because NFT formation requires human tau. To test this hypothesis, we crossbred APPOSK-Tg mice with tau-Tg mice (tau264), which express low levels of 3-repeat and 4-repeat wild-type human tau without any pathology. The resultant double Tg mice displayed tau hyperphosphorylation at 6 months and NFT formation at 18 months in the absence of tau mutations. Importantly, these NFTs contained both 3-repeat and 4-repeat human tau, similar to those in AD. Furthermore, the double Tg mice exhibited Abeta oligomer accumulation, synapse loss, and memory impairment at 6 months and neuronal loss at 18 months, all of which appeared earlier than in the parent APPOSK-Tg mice. These results suggest that Abeta and human tau synergistically interact to accelerate each other's pathology, that the presence of human tau is critical for NFT formation, and that Abeta oligomers can induce NFTs in the absence of amyloid plaques.

24535457|t|A genome-wide association meta-analysis of plasma Abeta peptides concentrations in the elderly.
24535457|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides are the major components of senile plaques, one of the main pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease (AD). However, Abeta peptides' functions are not fully understood and seem to be highly pleiotropic. We hypothesized that plasma Abeta peptides concentrations could be a suitable endophenotype for a genome-wide association study (GWAS) designed to (i) identify novel genetic factors involved in amyloid precursor protein metabolism and (ii) highlight relevant Abeta-related physiological and pathophysiological processes. Hence, we performed a genome-wide association meta-analysis of four studies totaling 3 528 healthy individuals of European descent and for whom plasma Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 peptides levels had been quantified. Although we did not observe any genome-wide significant locus, we identified 18 suggestive loci (P<1 x 10(-)(5)). Enrichment-pathway analyses revealed canonical pathways mainly involved in neuronal functions, for example, axonal guidance signaling. We also assessed the biological impact of the gene most strongly associated with plasma Abeta1-42 levels (cortexin 3, CTXN3) on APP metabolism in vitro and found that the gene protein was able to modulate Abeta1-42 secretion. In conclusion, our study results suggest that plasma Abeta peptides levels are valid endophenotypes in GWASs and can be used to characterize the metabolism and functions of APP and its metabolites.

24535580|t|Vaccination against Alzheimer disease: an update on future strategies.
24535580|a|Alzheimer disease is a devastating chronic disease without adequate therapy. More than 10 years ago, it was demonstrated in transgenic mouse models that vaccination may be a novel, disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer. Subsequent clinical development has been a roller-coaster with some positive and many negative news. Here, we would like to summarize evidence that next generation vaccines optimized for old people and focusing on patients with mild disease stand a good chance to proof efficacious for the treatment of Alzheimer.

24547901|t|Alzheimer's Abeta10-40 peptide binds and penetrates DMPC bilayer: an isobaric-isothermal replica exchange molecular dynamics study.
24547901|a|Using all-atom explicit solvent model and isobaric-isothermal replica exchange molecular dynamics, we studied binding of Abeta10-40 monomers to zwitterionic DMPC bilayer. Our simulations suggest three main conclusions. First, binding of Abeta10-40 monomer to the DMPC bilayer causes dramatic structural transition in the peptide resulting in the formation of stable helical structure in the C-terminal. In addition, binding to the lipid bilayer induces the formation of intrapeptide Asp23-Lys28 salt bridge. We argue that the emergence of helix is the consequence of hidden helix propensity harbored in the Abeta10-40 C-terminal. This propensity is revealed by the lipids cross-bridging amino acids in helical conformations and by significant hydrophobic moment of the C-terminal. Second, the central hydrophobic cluster and, particularly, the C-terminal of Abeta10-40 not only govern binding to the bilayer but also penetrate into bilayer core. In contrast, the polar N-terminal and turn region form interactions mainly with the bilayer surface. Third, our simulations suggest that upon Abeta10-40 binding to the bilayer a highly heterogeneous local environment emerges along Abeta10-40 chain. The N-terminal is exposed to polar well-hydrated medium, whereas the C-terminal is largely shielded from water residing in mostly hydrophobic environment. The implication of our results is that Abeta aggregation mediated by zwitterionic lipid bilayer is likely to be different from that in bulk water.

24549099|t|Plasma prion protein concentration and progression of Alzheimer disease.
24549099|a|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Recently, PrP(c) has been linked to AD pathogenesis. Second, a relation of PrP(c) plasma levels with cognitive status and decline of healthy elderly subjects has been reported. Therefore, we hypothesized baseline plasma levels of PrP(c) to be associated with AD progression in cognitive and functional domains. MATERIALS AND METHODS: AD patients (n = 84) were included into an observational study at time of diagnosis. Baseline plasma PrP(c) levels were determined. Decline was assessed annually (mean follow-up time 3 years) with the aid of different standardized tests (MMSE, iADL, bADL, GDS, UPDRSIII). Multiple regression analyses were used to uncover potential associations between decline and PrP(c) levels. RESULTS: No association of PrP(c) and decline could be established. Presence of diabetes mellitus was linked to slower deterioration. Intake of neuroleptic drugs or memantine was associated with faster progression. CONCLUSION: Plasma PrP(c) at baseline could not be shown to be related to AD progression in this study. An interesting association of diabetes mellitus and decline warrants further investigation.

24549986|t|Betaine suppressed Abeta generation by altering amyloid precursor protein processing.
24549986|a|Betaine was an endogenous catabolite of choline, which could be isolated from vegetables and marine products. Betaine could promote the metabolism of homocysteine in healthy subjects and was used for hyperlipidemia, coronary atherosclerosis, and fatty liver in clinic. Recent findings shown that Betaine rescued neuronal damage due to homocysteine induced Alzheimer's disease (AD) like pathological cascade, including tau hyperphosphorylation and amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition. Abeta was derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, and was a triggering factor for AD pathological onset. Here, we demonstrated that Betaine reduced Abeta levels by altering APP processing in N2a cells stably expressing Swedish mutant of APP. Betaine increased alpha-secretase activity, but decreased beta-secretase activity. Our data indicate that Betaine might play a protective role in Abeta production.

24553856|t|Cellular membrane fluidity in amyloid precursor protein processing.
24553856|a|The senile plaque is a pathologic hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), the main constituent of senile plaques, is neurotoxic especially in its oligomeric form. Abeta is derived from the sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretases in the amyloidogenic pathway. Alternatively, APP can be cleaved by alpha-secretases within the Abeta domain to produce neurotrophic and neuroprotective alpha-secretase-cleaved soluble APP (sAPPalpha) in the nonamyloidogenic pathway. Since APP and alpha-, beta-, and gamma-secretases are membrane proteins, APP processing should be highly dependent on the membrane composition and the biophysical properties of cellular membrane. In this review, we discuss the role of the biophysical properties of cellular membrane in APP processing, especially the effects of phospholipases A(2) (PLA(2)s), fatty acids, cholesterol, and Abeta on membrane fluidity in relation to their effects on APP processing.

24553930|t|A sensitive abeta oligomer assay discriminates Alzheimer's and aged control cerebrospinal fluid.
24553930|a|A hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain is the amyloid beta (Abeta) plaque, which is comprised of Abeta peptides. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that Abeta oligomers are more toxic than other peptide forms. We sought to develop a robust assay to quantify oligomers from CSF. Antibody 19.3 was compared in one-site and competitive ELISAs for oligomer binding specificity. A two-site ELISA for oligomers was developed using 19.3 coupled to a sensitive, bead-based fluorescent platform able to detect single photons of emitted light. The two-site ELISA was >2500x selective for Abeta oligomers over Abeta monomers with a limit of detection ~ 0.09 pg/ml in human CSF. The lower limit of reliable quantification of the assay was 0.18 pg/ml and the antibody pairs recognized Abeta multimers comprised of either synthetic standards, or endogenous oligomers isolated from confirmed human AD and healthy control brain. Using the assay, a significant 3- to 5-fold increase in Abeta oligomers in human AD CSF compared with comparably aged controls was demonstrated. The increase was seen in three separate human cohorts, totaling 63 AD and 54 controls. CSF oligomers ranged between 0.1 and 10 pg/ml. Abeta oligomer levels did not strongly associate with age or gender, but had an inverse correlation with MMSE score. The C statistic for the Abeta oligomer ROC curve was 0.86, with 80% sensitivity and 88% specificity to detect AD, suggesting reasonable discriminatory power for the AD state and the potential for utility as a diagnostic marker.

24555862|t|Smart near-infrared fluorescence probes with donor-acceptor structure for in vivo detection of beta-amyloid deposits.
24555862|a|The deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques in the parenchymal and cortical brain is accepted as the main pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, early detection of AD still presents a challenge. With the assistance of molecular imaging techniques, imaging agents specifically targeting Abeta plaques in the brain may lead to the early diagnosis of AD. Herein, we report the design, synthesis, and evaluation of a series of smart near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging probes with donor-acceptor architecture bridged by a conjugated pi-electron chain for Abeta plaques. The chemical structure of these NIRF probes is completely different from Congo Red and Thioflavin-T. Probes with a longer conjugated pi system (carbon-carbon double bond) displayed maximum emission in PBS (>650 nm), which falls in the best range for NIRF probes. These probes were proved to have affinity to Abeta plaques in fluorescent staining of brain sections from an AD patient and double transgenic mice, as well as in an in vitro binding assay using Abeta(1-42) aggregates. One probe with high affinity (K(i) = 37 nM, K(d) = 27 nM) was selected for in vivo imaging. It can penetrate the blood-brain barrier of nude mice efficiently and is quickly washed out of the normal brain. Moreover, after intravenous injection of this probe, 22-month-old APPswe/PSEN1 mice exhibited a higher relative signal than control mice over the same period of time, and ex vivo fluorescent observations confirmed the existence of Abeta plaques. In summary, this probe meets most of the requirements for a NIRF contrast agent for the detection of Abeta plaques both in vitro and in vivo.

24556805|t|DNA methylation of the TNF-alpha promoter region in peripheral blood monocytes and the cortex of human Alzheimer's disease patients.
24556805|a|BACKGROUND: The cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is elevated in the blood of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Epigenetic DNA modifications of the TNF-alpha promoter may account for the observed upregulation. METHODS: We analyzed blood samples of 50 AD patients and 55 controls plus 4 AD and 4 control cortex samples using bisulfite sequencing PCR. RESULTS: A significant hypomethylation of the TNF-alpha promoter was found in AD patients' brains but not in their blood. Cortical TNF-alpha promoter DNA was higher methylated than blood-derived DNA, both in AD patients and controls. CONCLUSION: In AD patients, epigenetic mechanisms of TNF-alpha gene regulation, like aberrant DNA methylation, are not relevant in blood.

24556945|t|Dynein dysfunction disrupts beta-amyloid clearance in astrocytes through endocytic disturbances.
24556945|a|We showed previously that aging attenuates the interaction between dynein-dynactin complexes in cynomolgus monkey brain and that dynein dysfunction reproduces age-dependent endocytic disturbances, resulting in intracellular beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation, synaptic vesicle transport deficits, and neuritic swelling. It remains unclear whether such endocytic disturbances also occur in glial cells. Here, we show that endocytic pathology, such as intracellular accumulation of enlarged endosomes, occurs in astrocytes of aged monkey brains. Also, Abeta accumulates in these enlarged endosomes. RNA interference studies have shown that dynein dysfunction reproduces astroglial endocytic pathology and disrupts Abeta clearance in astrocytes through endocytic disturbances. These findings suggest that endocytic disturbances can alter astroglial functions and may also be involved in age-dependent Abeta pathology.

Other proteases such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase were not inhibited by concentrations up to 1.0 mM, indicating that inhibition of beta-secretase was specific. 1 was noncompetitive in Dixon plot, and Ki value was 3.79 muM.

24560029|t|The MultiTEP platform-based Alzheimer's disease epitope vaccine activates a broad repertoire of T helper cells in nonhuman primates.
24560029|a|BACKGROUND: As a prelude to clinical trials we have characterized B- and T-cell immune responses in macaques to AD vaccine candidates: AV-1955 and its slightly modified version, AV-1959 (with 3 additional promiscuous Th epitopes). METHODS: T- and B-cell epitope mapping was performed using the ELISPOT assay and competition ELISA, respectively. RESULTS: AV-1955 and AV-1959 did not stimulate potentially harmful autoreactive T cells, but instead activated a broad but individualized repertoire of Th cells specific to the MultiTEP platform in macaques. Although both vaccines induced robust anti-Abeta antibody responses without producing antibodies specific to Th epitopes of MultiTEP platforms, analyses of cellular immune responses in macaques demonstrated that the addition of Th epitopes in the case of AV-1959 created a more potent, superior vaccine. CONCLUSION: AV-1959 is a promising vaccine candidate capable of producing therapeutically potent anti-amyloid antibody in a broader population of vaccinated subjects with high MHC class II gene polymorphisms.

24561065|t|Endothelin receptor type B agonist, IRL-1620, prevents beta amyloid (Abeta) induced oxidative stress and cognitive impairment in normal and diabetic rats.
24561065|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive brain disorder leading to impairment of learning and memory. Amyloid beta (Abeta) induced oxidative stress has been implicated in the initiation and progression of AD. Endothelin (ET) and its receptors have been considered as therapeutic targets for AD. Recent studies indicate that stimulation of ETB receptors may provide neuroprotection. The purpose of this study was to determine the preventative effect of selectively stimulating ETB receptors on cognitive impairment and oxidative stress in Abeta treated non-diabetic and diabetic (induced by streptozotocin) rats. Rats were concurrently treated with Abeta1-40 (day 1, 7 and 14) and either saline, IRL-1620 (an ETB agonist), and/or BQ788 (an ETB antagonist) daily for 14 days in the lateral cerebral ventricles using sterotaxically implanted cannula; experiments were performed on day 15. Abeta treatment produced a significant (p<0.0001) increase of 360% and 365% in malondialdehyde levels (a marker of lipid peroxidation) in non-diabetic and diabetic rats, respectively, compared to sham group. Antioxidants (superoxide dismutase and reduced glutathione) decreased following Abeta treatment compared to sham group. Treatment with IRL-1620 reversed these effects, indicating that ETB receptor stimulation reduces oxidative stress injury following Abeta treatment. In Morris swim task, Abeta treated rats showed impairment in spatial memory. Rats treated with IRL-1620 significantly reduced the cognitive impairment induced by Abeta. BQ788 treatment completely blocked IRL-1620 induced reduction in oxidative stress and cognitive impairment. Results of the present study demonstrate that IRL-1620 improved both acquisition (learning) and retention (memory) on water maze task and reduced oxidative stress parameters. It can be speculated that ETB receptor stimulation prevents cognitive impairment and may be useful in neurodegenerative diseases.

24561226|t|Mitochondrial import and degradation of amyloid-beta peptide.
24561226|a|Mitochondrial dysfunctions associated with amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) accumulation in mitochondria have been observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients' brains and in AD mice models. Abeta is produced by sequential action of beta- and gamma-secretases cleaving the amyloid precursor protein (APP). The gamma-secretase complex was found in mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAM) suggesting that this could be a potential site of Abeta production, from which Abeta is further transported into the mitochondria. In vitro, Abeta was shown to be imported into the mitochondria through the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) complex. The mitochondrial presequence protease (PreP) is responsible for Abeta degradation reducing toxic effects of Abeta on mitochondrial functions. The proteolytic activity of PreP is, however, lower in AD brain temporal lobe mitochondria and in AD transgenic mice models, possibly due to an increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Here, we review the intracellular mechanisms of Abeta production, its mitochondrial import and the intra-mitochondrial degradation. We also discuss the implications of a reduced efficiency of mitochondrial Abeta clearance for AD. Understanding the underlying mechanisms may provide new insights into mitochondria related pathogenesis of AD and development of drug therapy against AD. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: 18th European Bioenergetic Conference.

24564538|t|Impact of bilayer lipid composition on the structure and topology of the transmembrane amyloid precursor C99 protein.
24564538|a|C99 (also known as beta-CTF) is the 99 residue transmembrane C-terminal domain (residues 672-770) of the amyloid precursor protein and is the immediate precursor of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) polypeptides. To test the dependence of the C99 structure on the composition of the host model membranes, NMR studies of C99 were conducted both in anionic lyso-myristoylphosphatidylglycerol (LMPG) micelles and in a series of five zwitterionic bicelle compositions involving phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin in which the acyl chain lengths of these lipid components varied from 14 to 24 carbons. Some of these mixtures are reported for the first time in this work and should be of broad utility in membrane protein research. The site-specific backbone (15)N and (1)H chemical shifts for C99 in LMPG and in all five bicelle mixtures were seen to be remarkably similar, indicating little dependence of the backbone structure of C99 on the composition of the host model membrane. However, the length of the transmembrane span was seen to vary in a manner that alters the positioning of the gamma-secretase cleavage sites with respect to the center of the bilayer. This observation may contribute to the known dependency of the Abeta42-to-Abeta40 production ratio on both membrane thickness and the length of the C99 transmembrane domain.

24566672|t|Disordered amyloidogenic peptides may insert into the membrane and assemble into common cyclic structural motifs.
24566672|a|Aggregation of disordered amyloidogenic peptides into oligomers is the causative agent of amyloid-related diseases. In solution, disordered protein states are characterized by heterogeneous ensembles. Among these, beta-rich conformers self-assemble via a conformational selection mechanism to form energetically-favored cross-beta structures, regardless of their precise sequences. These disordered peptides can also penetrate the membrane, and electrophysiological data indicate that they form ion-conducting channels. Based on these and additional data, including imaging and molecular dynamics simulations of a range of amyloid peptides, Alzheimer's amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide, its disease-related variants with point mutations and N-terminal truncated species, other amyloidogenic peptides, as well as a cytolytic peptide and a synthetic gel-forming peptide, we suggest that disordered amyloidogenic peptides can also present a common motif in the membrane. The motif consists of curved, moon-like beta-rich oligomers associated into annular organizations. The motif is favored in the lipid bilayer since it permits hydrophobic side chains to face and interact with the membrane and the charged/polar residues to face the solvated channel pores. Such channels are toxic since their pores allow uncontrolled leakage of ions into/out of the cell, destabilizing cellular ionic homeostasis. Here we detail Abeta, whose aggregation is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and for which there are the most abundant data. AD is a protein misfolding disease characterized by a build-up of Abeta peptide as senile plaques, neurodegeneration, and memory loss. Excessively produced Abeta peptides may directly induce cellular toxicity, even without the involvement of membrane receptors through Abeta peptide-plasma membrane interactions.

24567151|t|Targeted studies on the interaction of nicotine and morin molecules with amyloid beta-protein.
24567151|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that occurs due to progressive deposition of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) in the brain. Stable conformations of solvated Abeta1-42 protein were predicted by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation using the OPLSAA force field. The seven residue peptide (Lys-Leu-Val-Phe-Phe-Ala-Glu) Abeta16-22 associated with AD was studied and reported in this paper. Since effective therapeutic agents have not yet been studied in detail, attention has focused on the use of natural products as effective anti-aggregation compounds, targeting the Abeta1-42 protein directly. Experimental and theoretical investigation suggests that some compounds extracted from natural products might be useful, but detailed insights into the mechanism by which they might act remains elusive. The molecules nicotine and morin are found in cigarettes and beverages. Here, we report the results of interaction studies of these compounds at each hydrophobic residue of Abeta16-22 peptide using the hybrid ONIOM (B3LYP/6-31G**:UFF) method. It was found that interaction with nicotine produced higher deformation in the Abeta16-22 peptide than interaction with morin. MD simulation studies revealed that interaction of the nicotine molecule with the beta-sheet of Abeta16-22 peptide transforms the beta-sheet to an alpha-helical structure, which helps prohibit the aggregation of Abeta-protein.

24569075|t|Evidence that a synthetic amyloid-ss oligomer-binding peptide (ABP) targets amyloid-ss deposits in transgenic mouse brain and human Alzheimer's disease brain.
24569075|a|The synthetic ~5 kDa ABP (amyloid-ss binding peptide) consists of a region of the 228 kDa human pericentrioloar material-1 (PCM-1) protein that selectively and avidly binds in vitro Abeta1-42 oligomers, believed to be key co-drivers of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but not monomers (Chakravarthy et al., (2013) [3]). ABP also prevents Ass1-42 from triggering the apoptotic death of cultured human SHSY5Y neuroblasts, likely by sequestering Ass oligomers, suggesting that it might be a potential AD therapeutic. Here we support this possibility by showing that ABP also recognizes and binds Abeta1-42 aggregates in sections of cortices and hippocampi from brains of AD transgenic mice and human AD patients. More importantly, ABP targets Abeta1-42 aggregates when microinjected into the hippocampi of the brains of live AD transgenic mice.

24573290|t|UV irradiation accelerates amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and disrupts APP axonal transport.
24573290|a|Overexpression and/or abnormal cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) are linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) development and progression. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating cellular levels of APP or its processing, and the physiological and pathological consequences of altered processing are not well understood. Here, using mouse and human cells, we found that neuronal damage induced by UV irradiation leads to specific APP, APLP1, and APLP2 decline by accelerating their secretase-dependent processing. Pharmacological inhibition of endosomal/lysosomal activity partially protects UV-induced APP processing implying contribution of the endosomal and/or lysosomal compartments in this process. We found that a biological consequence of UV-induced gamma-secretase processing of APP is impairment of APP axonal transport. To probe the functional consequences of impaired APP axonal transport, we isolated and analyzed presumptive APP-containing axonal transport vesicles from mouse cortical synaptosomes using electron microscopy, biochemical, and mass spectrometry analyses. We identified a population of morphologically heterogeneous organelles that contains APP, the secretase machinery, molecular motors, and previously proposed and new residents of APP vesicles. These possible cargoes are enriched in proteins whose dysfunction could contribute to neuronal malfunction and diseases of the nervous system including AD. Together, these results suggest that damage-induced APP processing might impair APP axonal transport, which could result in failure of synaptic maintenance and neuronal dysfunction.

24574275|a|Nanosized metallo-supramolecular compounds, [Ni2 L3 ](4+) and [Fe2 L3 ](4+) , can not only strongly inhibit Abeta aggregation but also reduce the peroxidase activity of Abeta-heme. Further studies demonstrate that through blocking the heme-binding site, these two compounds can suppress Abeta-induced biosynthesis of heme and iron uptake in PC12 cells. This work provides new insights into molecular mechanisms of Abeta inhibitors on Abeta-mediated neurotoxicity.

24575974|t|Amyloid beta peptide conformational changes in the presence of a lipid membrane system.
24575974|a|Here we are presenting a comparative analysis of conformational changes of two amyloid beta peptides, Abeta(25-35) and Abeta(1-42), in the presence and absence of a phospholipid system, namely, POPC/POPS (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphospatidylcholine/palmitoyl-2-oleoylphospatidylserine), through Raman spectroscopy, synchrotron radiation micro Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and micro X-ray diffraction. Ringlike samples were obtained from the evaporation of pure and mixed solutions of the proteins together with the POPC/POPS system on highly hydrophilic substrates. The results confirm the presence of a alpha-helical to beta-sheet transition from the internal rim of the ringlike samples to the external one in the pure Abeta(25-35) residual, probably due to the convective flow inside the droplets sitting on highly hydrophilic substrates enhancing the local concentration of the peptide at the external edge of the dried drop. In contrast, the presence of POPC/POPS lipids in the peptide does not result in alpha-helical structures and introduces the presence of antiparallel beta-sheet material together with parallel beta-sheet structures and possible beta-turns. As a control, Abeta(1-42) peptide was also tested and shows beta-sheet conformations independently from the presence of the lipid system. The muXRD analysis further confirmed these conclusions, showing how the absence of the phospholipid system induces in the Abeta(25-35) a probable composite alpha/beta material while its coexistence with the peptide leads to a not oriented beta-sheet conformation. These results open interesting scenarios on the study of conformational changes of Abeta peptides and could help, with further investigations, to better clarify the role of enzymes and alternative lipid systems involved in the amyloidosis process of Abeta fragments.

24576002|t|Crystal structure and interaction of phycocyanin with beta-secretase: A putative therapy for Alzheimer's disease.
24576002|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a neurological disorder, which is caused by enzymatic degradation of an amyloid precursor protein into short peptide fragments that undergo association to form insoluble plaques. Preliminary studies suggest that cyanobacterial extracts, especially the light-harvesting protein phycocyanin, may provide a means to control the progression of the disease. However, the molecular mechanism of disease control remains elusive. In the present study, intact hexameric phycocyanin was isolated and crystallized from the cyanobacterium Leptolyngbya sp. N62DM, and the structure was solved to a resolution of 2.6 A. Molecular docking studies show that the phycocyanin alphabeta-dimer interacts with the enzyme beta-secretase, which catalyzes the proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein to form plaques. The molecular docking studies suggest that the interaction between phycocyanin and beta-secretase is energetically more favorable than previously reported inhibitor-beta-secretase interactions. Transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans worms, with a genotype to serve as an AD-model, were significantly protected by phycocyanin. Therefore, the present study provides a novel structure-based molecular mechanism of phycocyanin-mediated therapy against AD.

24576490|t|Amyloid beta peptide (25-35) in picomolar concentrations modulates the function of glycine receptors in rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons through interaction with extracellular site(s).
24576490|a|beta-Amyloid peptide (Abeta) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer s disease, but in lower amounts it is found in normal brains where it participates in physiological processes and probably regulates synaptic plasticity. This study investigated the effects of physiologically relevant concentrations of Abeta (1 pM-100 nM), fragment 25-35, on glycine-mediated membrane current in acutely isolated rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons using whole-cell patch-clamp technique. We have found that short (600 ms) co-application of glycine with Abeta caused reversible dose-dependent and voltage-independent acceleration of desensitization of glycine current. The peak amplitude of the current remained unchanged. The effect of picomolar Abeta concentrations persisted in the presence of 1 microM Abeta in the pipette solution, implying that Abeta bounds to extracellular site(s). Concentration-dependence curve was N-shaped with maximums at 100 pM and 100 nM, suggesting the existence of two binding sites, which may interact with each other. Glycine current resistant to 100 microM picrotoxin, was insensitive to Abeta, which suggests that Abeta affected mainly homomeric glycine receptors. When Abeta was added to bath solution, besides acceleration of desensitization, it caused reversible dose-dependent reduction of glycine current peak amplitude. These results demonstrate that physiological (picomolar) concentrations of Abeta reversibly augment the desensitization of glycine current, probably by binding to external sites on homomeric glycine receptors. Furthermore, Abeta can suppress the peak amplitude of glycine current, but this effect develops slowly and may be mediated through some intracellular machinery.

24576746|t|Increased plasma levels of BDNF and inflammatory markers in Alzheimer's disease.
24576746|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. Neurotrophic factors and inflammatory markers may play considerable roles in AD. In this study we measured, through Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, the plasma levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and neuronal growth factor (NGF), as well as tumor necrosis factor-alpha soluble receptors, sTNFR1 and sTNFR2, and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1), in 50 AD patients, 37 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 56 healthy elderly controls. BDNF levels, expressed as median and interquartile range, were higher for AD patients (2545.3, 1497.4-4153.4 pg/ml) compared to controls (1503.8, 802.3-2378.4 pg/ml), P < 0.001. sICAM-1 was also higher in AD patients. sTNFR1 levels were increased in AD when compared to controls and also to MCI. GDNF, NGF and sTNFR2 levels showed no significant differences among the studied groups. The increase in BDNF might reflect a compensatory mechanism against early neurodegeneration and seems to be related to inflammation. sTNFR1 appears to mark not only the inflammatory state but also differentiates between MCI and AD, which may be an additional tool for differentiating degrees of cognitive impairment.

24577081|t|High-dose of vitamin C supplementation reduces amyloid plaque burden and ameliorates pathological changes in the brain of 5XFAD mice.
24577081|a|Blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown and mitochondrial dysfunction have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease characterized by cognitive deficits and neuronal loss. Besides vitamin C being as one of the important antioxidants, recently, it has also been reported as a modulator of BBB integrity and mitochondria morphology. Plasma levels of vitamin C are decreased in AD patients, which can affect disease progression. However, investigation using animal models on the role of vitamin C in the AD pathogenesis has been hampered because rodents produce with no dependence on external supply. Therefore, to identify the pathogenic importance of vitamin C in an AD mouse model, we cross-bred 5 familial Alzheimer's disease mutation (5XFAD) mice (AD mouse model) with iota-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase (Gulo) knockout (KO) mice, which are unable to synthesize their own vitamin C, and produced Gulo KO mice with 5XFAD mice background (KO-Tg). These mice were maintained on either low (0.66 g/l) or high (3.3 g/l) supplementation of vitamin C. We found that the higher supplementation of vitamin C had reduced amyloid plaque burden in the cortex and hippocampus in KO-Tg mice, resulting in amelioration of BBB disruption and mitochondrial alteration. These results suggest that intake of a larger amount of vitamin C could be protective against AD-like pathologies.

24577197|t|The importance of amyloid beta protein in cerebrospinal fluid when you recognize convexal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
24577197|a|BACKGROUND: Convexal subarachnoid hemorrhage (cSAH) is sometimes experienced in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), but ones that are repeated within a brief time period are not common. Also, it is often difficult to diagnose CAA when you experience a case of cSAH. METHODS: We examined the clinical course of 2 cases that showed cSAH repeatedly. We examined cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) 40 and 42 and tau protein as additional evidence for a diagnosis of CAA. RESULTS: Case 1 presented with transient motor paresis of the left hand and case 2 with transient sensory disturbance of the left hand. CT scans showed cSAH on the right central sulcus in both patients. Case 1 showed development of intracerebral hemorrhage on the frontal lobe near the right central sulcus. Case 2 showed relapse of cSAH with recurrence of the same symptoms. These cases could not be diagnosed by image analysis, but were considered CAA by Abeta40, Abeta42 and tau protein in CSF. CONCLUSION: Abeta in CSF can be presented here as support for the diagnosis of CAA that is difficult to diagnose by Boston criteria.

24577457|t|White matter hyperintensities are associated with amyloid burden in APOE4 non-carriers.
24577457|a|Previous preclinical studies have suggested a close relationship between cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer's disease. However, a direct correlation between CVD and amyloid burden has not yet been shown in humans. If there is a relationship between CVD and amyloid burden, it is possible that the apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) genotype may have an effect on this relationship because APOE4 is a risk factor for the development of AD. We therefore evaluated the effects of APOE4 on the relationship between white matter hyperintensities (WMH), a marker of CVD, and amyloid burden, measured by 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET. We recruited 53 patients with subcortical vascular cognitive impairments, who had both WMH on MRI and amyloid deposition assessed by PiB PET. Twenty-two of these patients were APOE4 carriers (41.5%). In the APOE4 non-carriers, a significant positive correlation was shown between the volume of WMH and PiB retention (beta = 7.0 x 10-3, p = 0.034) while no significant correlation was found in APOE4 carriers (beta = -9.0 x 10-3, p = 0.085). Statistical parametric mapping analyses in APOE4 non-carriers showed that WMH were associated with PiB retention in the bilateral medial occipitotemporal gyrus, cuneus, and superior cerebellum. Our results suggested that WMH are correlated with amyloid burden especially in the posterior brain regions in APOE4 non-carriers. However, this correlation was not observed in APOE4 carriers, perhaps because in these subjects the influence of APOE4 overrides the effect of CVD.

24577464|t|Central and peripheral administration of antisense oligonucleotide targeting amyloid-beta protein precursor improves learning and memory and reduces neuroinflammatory cytokines in Tg2576 (AbetaPPswe) mice.
24577464|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. Currently, there are no therapies to stop or reverse the symptoms of AD. We have developed an antisense oligonucleotide (OL-1) against the amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) that can decrease AbetaPP expression and amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) production. This antisense rapidly crosses the blood-brain barrier, reverses learning and memory impairments, reduces oxidative stress, and restores brain-to-blood efflux of Abeta in SAMP8 mice. Here, we examined the effects of this AbetaPP antisense in the Tg2576 mouse model of AD. We administered the OL-1 antisense into the lateral ventricle 3 times at 2week intervals. Seventy-two hours after the third injection, we tested learning and memory in T-maze foot shock avoidance. In the second study, we injected the mice with OL-1 antisense 3 times at 2-week intervals via the tail vein. Seventy-two hours later, we tested learning and memory T-maze, novel object recognition, and elevated plus maze. At the end of behavioral testing, brain tissue was collected. OL-1 antisense administered centrally improved acquisition and retention of T-maze foot shock avoidance. OL-1 antisense administered via tail vein improved learning and memory in both T-maze foot shock avoidance and novel object-place recognition. In the elevated plus maze, the mice which received OL-1 antisense spent less time in the open arms and had fewer entries into the open arms indicating reduced disinhibitation. Biochemical analyses reveal significant reduction of AbetaPP signal and a reduction of measures of neuroinflammation. The current findings support the therapeutic potential of OL-1 AbetaPP antisense.

24577473|t|Plasma concentrations of the amyloid-beta peptides in young volunteers: the influence of the APOE genotype.
24577473|a|Changes in the concentrations of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the body fluids are the earliest alterations observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD), however, there is a lack of data about how early these alterations occur, before the onset of the clinical symptoms. APOE genotype is the most recognized genetic risk/protective factor of AD, meaning that a group of non-demented persons carrying epsilon4 allele is enriched in the subjects who will develop AD, compared to the group of non-carriers. Therefore, we studied the plasma concentrations of Abeta peptides (Abeta1-42, Abeta1-40, Abetax-42, and Abetax-40), and the APOE genotype in 173 young volunteers (average age, 28 +- 7.6 years) without memory deficits, in order to see whether the non-demented group of subjects at risk already characterize with Abeta changes three-to-four decades before the age at which dementia usually occurs. We did not find statistically significant differences among the groups of epsilon4 carriers, epsilon3 homozygotes, and epsilon2 carriers. We conclude that the APOE genotype does not influence the metabolism of the Abeta peptides in young persons without memory deficits.

24577479|t|Selenomethionine ameliorates cognitive decline, reduces tau hyperphosphorylation, and reverses synaptic deficit in the triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
24577479|a|Disruption of the intracellular balance between free radicals and the antioxidant system is a prominent and early feature in the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Selenium, a vital trace element with known antioxidant potential, has been reported to provide neuroprotection through resisting oxidative damage but its therapeutic effect on AD remains to be investigated. The objective of our study was to investigate the potential of selenomethionine (Se-Met), an organic form of selenium, in the treatment of cognitive dysfunction and neuropathology of triple transgenic AD (3 x Tg-AD) mice. 3 x Tg-AD mice, which were four months old, were treated with Se-Met for 3 months and demonstrated significant improvements in cognitive deficit along with an increased selenium level compared with the untreated control mice. Se-Met treatment significantly reduced the level of total tau and phosphorylated tau, mitigated the decrease of synaptic proteins including synaptophysin and postsynaptic density protein 95 in the hippocampus and cortex of the 3 x Tg-AD mice. Meanwhile, glial activation in AD mice was inhibited and the level of reduced glutathione was increased in the treated mice compared with control mice. Additionally, the expression and activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta and protein phosphatase 2A, two important enzymes involved in tau phosphorylation, were markedly decreased and increased respectively by Se-Met treatment. Thus Se-Met improves cognitive deficit in a murine model of AD, which is associated with reduction in tau expression and hyperphosphorylation, amelioration of inflammation, and restoration of synaptic proteins and antioxidants. This study provides a novel therapeutic approach for the prevention of AD.

24577515|t|Chronic cannabidiol treatment improves social and object recognition in double transgenic APPswe/PS1 E9 mice.
24577515|a|RATIONALE: Patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibit a decline in cognitive abilities including an inability to recognise familiar faces. Hallmark pathological changes in AD include the aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta), tau protein hyperphosphorylation as well as pronounced neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, neurotoxicity and oxidative damage. OBJECTIVES: The non-psychoactive phytocannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD) exerts neuroprotective, anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects and promotes neurogenesis. CBD also reverses Abeta-induced spatial memory deficits in rodents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thus we determined the therapeutic-like effects of chronic CBD treatment (20 mg/kg, daily intraperitoneal injections for 3 weeks) on the APPswe/PS1 E9 (APPxPS1) transgenic mouse model for AD in a number of cognitive tests, including the social preference test, the novel object recognition task and the fear conditioning paradigm. We also analysed the impact of CBD on anxiety behaviours in the elevated plus maze. RESULTS: Vehicle-treated APPxPS1 mice demonstrated impairments in social recognition and novel object recognition compared to wild type-like mice. Chronic CBD treatment reversed these cognitive deficits in APPxPS1 mice without affecting anxiety-related behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to investigate the effect of chronic CBD treatment on cognition in an AD transgenic mouse model. Our findings suggest that CBD may have therapeutic potential for specific cognitive impairments associated with AD.

24578023|t|Business continuity management in international organisations.
24578023|a|In the area of business continuity management, a preliminary review of the literature reveals extensive knowledge, expertise and experience concerning organisations in the private and public sectors. It is interesting to note, however, that there is little literature about business continuity management in international organisations, although these entities are complex and particularly prone to threats. This apparent absence of literature suggests that business continuity management has not yet hit the agenda of international organisations. In recent years, member states have encouraged senior management to design and implement business continuity strategies to minimise the mishandling of an internal crisis and build organisational resilience, but very few of them have actually been able to design and implement comprehensive business continuity programmes. Based on actual experience working in international organisations, this paper outlines some of the challenges faced by international organisations in developing and implementing business continuity activities and attempts to make suggestions for further improvement. 

24583037|t|Lixisenatide rescues spatial memory and synaptic plasticity from amyloid beta protein-induced impairments in rats.
24583037|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and degenerative disorder accompanied by cognitive impairment, but effective strategies against AD are currently not available. Interestingly, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) used in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has shown neuroprotective effects in preclinical studies of AD. Lixisenatide, an effective GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist with much longer half life than GLP-1, has been licensed in the EU as a treatment for T2DM. However, the neuroprotective effects of lixisenatide in the brain remain to be clarified. In the present study, we report for the first time the effects of lixisenatide on the amyloid beta (Abeta) protein-induced impairments in spatial learning and memory of rats, and investigated its electrophysiological and molecular mechanisms. We found that: (1) bilateral intrahippocampal injection of Abeta25-35 resulted in a significant decline in spatial learning and memory of rats, as well as a suppression of in vivo hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP); (2) lixisenatide treatment effectively prevented the Abeta25-35-induced impairments; (3) lixisenatide inhibited the Abeta25-35 injection-induced activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta), with a significant increase in the phosphorylation of ser9 and a significant decrease in the phosphorylation of Y216. These results indicate that lixisenatide, by affecting the PI3K-Akt-GSK3beta pathway, can prevent Abeta-related impairments in synaptic plasticity and spatial memory of rats, suggesting that lixisenatide may be a novel and effective treatment for AD.

24583405|t|Impaired hippocampal neurogenesis and its enhancement with ghrelin in 5XFAD mice.
24583405|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurological disorder characterized by the deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta), cognitive deficits, and neuronal loss. The decline in neurogenic capacity could participate in neuronal vulnerability and contribute to memory impairment in AD. In our longitudinal study with AD model mice (5XFAD mice), we found that the number of doublecortin (neurogenesis marker)-positive cells in 5XFAD mice was significantly decreased compared to wild-type littermate mice. Using Abeta immunostaining with 4G8 antibody, we observed that impairment in neurogenesis might be associated with the deposits of amyloid plaques. To investigate the effect of the neurogenic hormone ghrelin on defective neurogenesis in the AD brain, 5XFAD mice were administered peripherally with ghrelin. We found that treatment with ghrelin increased the number of doublecortin, HH3, and calretinin-stained cells in the hippocampus of 5XFAD mice. In 5XFAD mice treated with ghrelin, the 4G8-positive area was not significantly different from the saline-treated 5XFAD mice. Together, these findings suggest that hippocampal neurogenesis is impaired in 5XFAD mice and that treatment with ghrelin successfully rescued the abnormality of neurogenesis in 5XFAD mice without affecting Abeta pathology.

24585367|t|Mild to moderate Alzheimer dementia with insufficient neuropathological changes.
24585367|a|Recently, ~16% of participants in an anti-Abeta passive immunotherapy trial for mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease (AD) had a negative baseline amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) scan. Whether they have AD or are AD clinical phenocopies remains unknown. We examined the 2005-2013 National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center autopsy database and found that ~14% of autopsied subjects clinically diagnosed with mild-to-moderate probable AD have no or sparse neuritic plaques, which would expectedly yield a negative amyloid PET scan. More than half of these "Abeta-negative" subjects have low neurofibrillary tangle Braak stages. These findings support the implementation of a positive amyloid biomarker as an inclusion criterion in future anti-Abeta drug trials.

24588450|t|Investigation of the aggregation process of amyloid-beta-(16-22) peptides and the dissolution of intermediate aggregates.
24588450|a|The aggregation processes of amyloid-beta-(16-22) peptides (Abeta16-22) are investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). It is found that Abeta16-22 peptides quickly aggregate from monomers to oligomers and flakelike structures and finally to fibrils. In particular, unusual morphology change is observed in an early stage of aggregation; that is, the originally formed flakelike structures would disappear in the following aggregation processes. To determine the evolution of the flakelike structures, in situ AFM imaging is carried out in liquid to reveal the real-time morphology change of Abeta16-22. The results provide clear evidence that the flakelike structures are in an unstable intermediate state, which would be dissolved into oligomers or short protofibrils for reorganization. Further fluorescence and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) experiments on thioflavin T(ThT) suggest that those flakelike structures contain beta-sheet components.

24588580|t|The role of screening audiometry in the management of otitis media with effusion in children with cleft palate in northern ireland.
24588580|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine uptake and outcome of hearing screening in the cleft palate population in Northern Ireland (NI) and the rate of ventilation tube (VT) insertion over a 3-year period. DESIGN: In NI, hearing screening is offered in the neonatal period, at 9 months in the community, and at 2.5 years in the joint cleft clinic. Patients : Eighty-five children with cleft palate born between 2006 and 2008 in NI were eligible for all three screenings. METHODS: A retrospective case note review was performed of tympanograms, audiometry, and VT insertion rates at each of the three time points. Results : In the neonatal period, all patients eligible were screened; 66 (77.6%) patients passed the screening, with 19 patients (22.4%) failing, resulting in direct referral to ENT for consideration of VT. Results of the 9-month community screening were not made routinely available to the regional cleft service. At the 2.5-year clinic screening, all attending patients (n = 80) had documented screening. Fifty-two (65%) patients passed screening, with 28 patients (35%) failing screening. Forty-six patients (57.5%) had documented VT, and 9 (11.25%) were awaiting ENT review for consideration of VT. CONCLUSION: Ventilation tubes are not routinely inserted at the time of cleft repair in the NI population, and 57.5% of our cleft population has ventilation tubes inserted by 2.5 years. Cleft patients in NI have regular routine hearing assessments, and our current practice avoids universal ventilation tube insertion while identifying those who need further hearing management. Further research is needed to reach an international consensus on the insertion of VT in cleft patients.

24589433|t|The amyloid hypothesis, time to move on: Amyloid is the downstream result, not cause, of Alzheimer's disease.
24589433|a|The "amyloid hypothesis" has dominated Alzheimer research for more than 20 years, and proposes that amyloid is the toxic cause of neural/synaptic damage and dementia. If correct, decreasing the formation or removing amyloid should be therapeutic. Despite discrepancies in the proposed mechanism, and failed clinical trials, amyloid continues to be considered the cause of a degenerative cascade. Alternative hypotheses must explain three features: (i) why amyloid toxicity is not the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), (ii) what alternative mechanisms cause the degeneration and dementia of AD, and (iii) why increased amyloid accumulates in the brain in AD. We propose that AD, which occurs in elderly, already vulnerable brains, with multiple age-related changes, is precipitated by impaired microvascular function, resulting primarily from decreased Notch-related angiogenesis. With impaired microvasculature, a lack of vascular endothelial-derived trophic factors and decreased cerebral blood flow cause the atrophy of neural structures. Therapeutic strategies should focus on supporting normal angiogenesis.

24589617|t|Loss of proteostasis induced by amyloid beta peptide in brain endothelial cells.
24589617|a|Abnormal accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide in the brain is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition to neurotoxic effects, Abeta also damages brain endothelial cells (ECs) and may thus contribute to the degeneration of cerebral vasculature, which has been proposed as an early pathogenic event in the course of AD and is able to trigger and/or potentiate the neurodegenerative process and cognitive decline. However, the mechanisms underlying Abeta-induced endothelial dysfunction are not completely understood. Here we hypothesized that Abeta impairs protein quality control mechanisms both in the secretory pathway and in the cytosol in brain ECs, leading cells to death. In rat brain RBE4 cells, we demonstrated that Abeta1-40 induces the failure of the ER stress-adaptive unfolded protein response (UPR), deregulates the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) decreasing overall proteasome activity with accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and impairs the autophagic protein degradation pathway due to failure in the autophagic flux, which culminates in cell demise. In conclusion, Abeta deregulates proteostasis in brain ECs and, as a consequence, these cells die by apoptosis.

24591104|t|A novel mechanism for cyclic adenosine monophosphate-mediated memory formation: Role of amyloid beta.
24591104|a|Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) regulates long-term potentiation (LTP) and ameliorates memory in healthy and diseased brain. Increasing evidence shows that, under physiological conditions, low concentrations of amyloid beta (Abeta) are necessary for LTP expression and memory formation. Here, we report that cAMP controls amyloid precursor protein (APP) translation and Abeta levels, and that the modulatory effects of cAMP on LTP occur through the stimulation of APP synthesis and Abeta production.

24591589|t|Clioquinol promotes the degradation of metal-dependent amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers to restore endocytosis and ameliorate Abeta toxicity.
24591589|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common, progressive neurodegenerative disorder without effective disease-modifying therapies. The accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is associated with AD. However, identifying new compounds that antagonize the underlying cellular pathologies caused by Abeta has been hindered by a lack of cellular models amenable to high-throughput chemical screening. To address this gap, we use a robust and scalable yeast model of Abeta toxicity where the Abeta peptide transits through the secretory and endocytic compartments as it does in neurons. The pathogenic Abeta 1-42 peptide forms more oligomers and is more toxic than Abeta 1-40 and genome-wide genetic screens identified genes that are known risk factors for AD. Here, we report an unbiased screen of ~140,000 compounds for rescue of Abeta toxicity. Of ~30 hits, several were 8-hydroxyquinolines (8-OHQs). Clioquinol (CQ), an 8-OHQ previously reported to reduce Abeta burden, restore metal homeostasis, and improve cognition in mouse AD models, was also effective and rescued the toxicity of Abeta secreted from glutamatergic neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans. In yeast, CQ dramatically reduced Abeta peptide levels in a copper-dependent manner by increasing degradation, ultimately restoring endocytic function. This mirrored its effects on copper-dependent oligomer formation in vitro, which was also reversed by CQ. This unbiased screen indicates that copper-dependent Abeta oligomer formation contributes to Abeta toxicity within the secretory/endosomal pathways where it can be targeted with selective metal binding compounds. Establishing the ability of the Abeta yeast model to identify disease-relevant compounds supports its further exploitation as a validated early discovery platform.

24594196|t|Familial Alzheimer's disease sustained by presenilin 2 mutations: systematic review of literature and genotype-phenotype correlation.
24594196|a|Familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD), despite representing a rare condition, is attracting a growing interest in the scientific community. Improved phenotyping of FAD cases may have a relevant impact both in clinical and research contexts. We performed a systematic review of studies describing the phenotypic features of FAD cases sustained by PSEN2 mutations, the less common cause of monogenic AD. Special attention was given to the clinical manifestations as well as to the main findings coming from the most commonly and widely adopted diagnostic procedures. Basing on the collected data, we also attempted to conduct a genotype-phenotype correlation analysis. Overall, the mutations involving the PSEN2 gene represent an extremely rare cause of FAD, having been reported to date in less than 200 cases. They are mainly associated, despite some peculiar and heterogeneous features, to a typical AD phenotype. Nevertheless, the frequent occurrence of psychotic symptoms may represent a potential distinctive element. The scarcity of available phenotypic descriptions strongly limits the implementation of genotype-phenotype correlations.

24594908|t|mGlu5 receptors and cellular prion protein mediate amyloid-beta-facilitated synaptic long-term depression in vivo.
24594908|a|NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) are currently regarded as paramount in the potent and selective disruption of synaptic plasticity by Alzheimer's disease amyloid beta-protein (Abeta). Non-NMDAR mechanisms remain relatively unexplored. Here we describe how Abeta facilitates NMDAR-independent long-term depression of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus in vivo. Synthetic Abeta and Abeta in soluble extracts of Alzheimer's disease brain usurp endogenous acetylcholine muscarinic receptor-dependent long-term depression, to enable long-term depression that required metabotropic glutamate-5 receptors (mGlu5Rs). We also find that mGlu5Rs are essential for Abeta-mediated inhibition of NMDAR-dependent long-term potentiation in vivo. Blocking Abeta binding to cellular prion protein with antibodies prevents the facilitation of long-term depression. Our findings uncover an overarching role for Abeta-PrP(C)-mGlu5R interplay in mediating both LTD facilitation and LTP inhibition, encompassing NMDAR-mediated processes that were previously considered primary.

24595193|t|Oral zinc reduces amyloid burden in Tg2576 mice.
24595193|a|The aggregation of amyloid-beta in Alzheimer's disease can be affected by free transition metals such as copper and zinc in the brain. Addition of copper and zinc with amyloid acts to increase aggregation and copper additionally promotes the formation of reactive oxygen species. We propose that reduction of brain copper by blocking uptake of copper from the diet is a viable strategy to regulate the formation of insoluble amyloid-beta in the brain of Tg2576 mice. Mice were treated with regimens of zinc acetate, which acts with metallothionein to block copper uptake in the gut, at various times along their lifespan to model prevention and treatment paradigms. We found that the mice tolerated zinc acetate well over the six month course of study. While we did not observe significant changes in cognition and behavior, there was a reduction in insoluble amyloid-beta in the brain. This observation coincided with a reduction in brain copper and interestingly no change in brain zinc. Our findings show that blocking copper uptake from the diet can redistribute copper from the brain and reduce amyloid-beta aggregation.

24595198|t|Brain pyroglutamate amyloid-beta is produced by cathepsin B and is reduced by the cysteine protease inhibitor E64d, representing a potential Alzheimer's disease therapeutic.
24595198|a|Pyroglutamate amyloid-beta peptides (pGlu-Abeta) are particularly pernicious forms of amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) present in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. pGlu-Abeta peptides are N-terminally truncated forms of full-length Abeta peptides (flAbeta(1-40/42)) in which the N-terminal glutamate is cyclized to pyroglutamate to generate pGlu-Abeta(3-40/42). beta-secretase cleavage of amyloid-beta precursor protein (AbetaPP) produces flAbeta(1-40/42), but it is not yet known whether the beta-secretase BACE1 or the alternative beta-secretase cathepsin B (CatB) participate in the production of pGlu-Abeta. Therefore, this study examined the effects of gene knockout of these proteases on brain pGlu-Abeta levels in transgenic AbetaPPLon mice, which express AbetaPP isoform 695 and have the wild-type (wt) beta-secretase activity found in most AD patients. Knockout or overexpression of the CatB gene reduced or increased, respectively, pGlu-Abeta(3-40/42), flAbeta(1-40/42), and pGlu-Abeta plaque load, but knockout of the BACE1 gene had no effect on those parameters in the transgenic mice. Treatment of AbetaPPLon mice with E64d, a cysteine protease inhibitor of CatB, also reduced brain pGlu-Abeta(3-42), flAbeta(1-40/42), and pGlu-Abeta plaque load. Treatment of neuronal-like chromaffin cells with CA074Me, an inhibitor of CatB, resulted in reduced levels of pGlu-Abeta(3-40) released from the activity-dependent, regulated secretory pathway. Moreover, CatB knockout and E64d treatment has been previously shown to improve memory deficits in the AbetaPPLon mice. These data illustrate the role of CatB in producing pGlu-Abeta and flAbeta that participate as key factors in the development of AD. The advantages of CatB inhibitors, especially E64d and its derivatives, as alternatives to BACE1 inhibitors in treating AD patients are discussed.

24595206|t|Transition-metal-substituted polyoxometalate derivatives as functional anti-amyloid agents for Alzheimer's disease.
24595206|a|Inhibitions of amyloid beta (Abeta) aggregation and Abeta-haem peroxidase-like activity have received much attention because these two symptoms can be the primary targets of therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, our group found that polyoxometalate (POM) with a Wells-Dawson structure can efficiently inhibit Abeta aggregation. However, the interaction between POMs and Abeta is robust, but still needs to improve Abeta binding affinity. More importantly, it is unclear whether POMs can cross the blood-brain barrier and decrease Abeta-haem peroxidase-like activity. Here we show that our designed series of transition metal-functionalized POM derivatives with a defined histidine-chelated binding site have much better Abeta inhibition and peroxidase-like activity inhibition effects than the parent POM. More intriguingly, we show that these compounds can cross the blood-brain barrier and are metabolized after 48 h. Our work provides insights into the design, synthesis and screening of inorganic metal compounds as multifunctional therapeutic agents against AD.

24595988|t|Dynamics in the solid-state: perspectives for the investigation of amyloid aggregates, membrane proteins and soluble protein complexes.
24595988|a|Aggregates formed by amyloidogenic peptides and proteins and reconstituted membrane protein preparations differ significantly in terms of the spectral quality that they display in solid-state NMR experiments. Structural heterogeneity and dynamics can both in principle account for that observation. This perspectives article aims to point out challenges and limitations, but also potential opportunities in the investigation of these systems. 

24596678|t|LRP-1 polymorphism is associated with global and regional amyloid load in Alzheimer's Disease in humans in-vivo.
24596678|a|OBJECTIVE: Impaired amyloid clearance has been proposed to contribute to beta-amyloid deposition in sporadic late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP-1) is involved in the active outward transport of beta-amyloid across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The C667T polymorphism (rs1799986) of the LRP-1 gene has been inconsistently associated with AD in genetic studies. We aimed to elucidate the association of this polymorphism with in-vivo brain amyloid load of AD patients using amyloid PET with [(11)C]PiB. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 72 patients with very mild to moderate AD were examined with amyloid PET and C667T polymorphism was obtained using TaqMan PCR assays. The association of C667T polymorphism with global and regional amyloid load was calculated using linear regression and voxel based analysis, respectively. The effect of the previously identified modulator of amyloid uptake, the apolipoprotein E genotype, on this association was also determined. RESULTS: The regression analysis between amyloid load and C667T polymorphism was statistically significant (p = 0.046, beta = 0.236). In an additional analysis ApoE genotype and gender were identified to explain further variability of amyloid load. Voxel based analysis revealed a significant (p < 0.05) association between C667T polymorphism and amyloid uptake in the temporo-parietal cortex bilaterally. ApoE did not interact significantly with the LRP-1 polymorphism. DISCUSSION: In conclusion, C667T polymorphism of LRP-1 is moderately but significantly associated with global and regional amyloid deposition in AD. The relationship appears to be independent of the ApoE genotype. This finding is compatible with the hypothesis that impaired amyloid clearance contributes to amyloid deposition in late-onset sporadic AD.

24597504|t|Accumulation of intraneuronal amyloid-beta is common in normal brain.
24597504|a|Intraneuronal amyloid-beta (iAbeta) accumulation has been demonstrated in Alzheimer disease (AD). Although extracellular amyloid plaques composed primarily of aggregated amyloid-beta are one of the main pathological features of AD, functional characterization of iAbeta is still lacking. In this study, we identified the normal distribution of iAbeta through an analysis of hippocampal sections from a series of over 90 subjects with diverse antemortem clinical findings. In addition to AD cases, iAbeta in pyramidal neurons was readily and reproducibly demonstrated in the majority of control cases. Similar findings for controls were made across all ages, spanning from infants to the elderly. There was no correlation of iAbeta between gender, postmortem interval, or age. While the possible pathophysiological significance of iAbeta accumulation in AD remains to be elucidated, careful examination of iAbeta found in the normal brain may be informative for determining the biological role of iAbeta and how this function changes during disease. Current findings support a physiological role for iAbeta in neuronal function over the entire lifespan.

24597613|t|JAK2/STAT5/Bcl-xL signalling is essential for erythropoietin-mediated protection against apoptosis induced in PC12 cells by the amyloid beta-peptide Abeta25-35.
24597613|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Erythropoietin (EPO) exerts neuroprotective actions in the CNS, including protection against apoptosis induced by the amyloid beta-peptide Abeta25-35 . However, it remains unclear which signalling pathway activated by EPO is involved in this neuroprotection. Here, we have investigated whether JAK2/STAT5/Bcl-xL and ERK1/2 signalling pathways are essential for EPO-mediated protection against apoptosis induced by Abeta25-35 . EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: EPO was added to cultures of PC12 cells, 1 h before Abeta25-35 . For kinase inhibitor studies, AG490 and PD98059 were added to PC12 cells, 0.5 h before the addition of EPO. Transfection with siRNA was used to knockdown STAT5. Activation of JAK2/STAT5/Bcl-xL and ERK1/2 signalling pathways were investigated by Western blotting. Cell viability was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) 2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay and apoptosis was detected by TUNEL and acridine orange-ethidium bromide double staining. KEY RESULTS: EPO increased phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT5 in PC12 cells treated with Abeta25-35 . Furthermore, EPO modulated the nuclear translocation of phospho-STAT5, which increased expression of Bcl-xL and decreased levels of caspase-3. These beneficial effects were blocked by the JAK2 inhibitor, AG490 or STAT5 knockdown. However, the ERK1/2 pathway did not play a crucial role in our model. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: EPO protected PC12 cells against Abeta25-35 -induced neurotoxicity. Activation of JAK2/STAT5/Bcl-xL pathway was important in EPO-mediated neuroprotection. EPO may serve as a novel protective agent against Abeta25-35 -induced cytotoxicity in, for instance, Alzheimer's disease.

24597727|t|Free energy of lipid bilayer defects affected by Alzheimer's disease-associated amyloid-beta42 monomers.
24597727|a|Experimental evidence suggests that the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) associated with Alzheimer's disease strongly disturbs the integrity of lipid bilayers and cell membranes, as a possible origin of the toxicity of this peptide. Here, we have used molecular dynamics simulations to compute the free energy of membrane pores in the presence and absence of Abeta. The validation of our approach included the calculation of lipid flip-flop waiting times, which were found to agree well with recent experiments, in contrast with an earlier simulation study that apparently overestimated these waiting times. We find that, compared with peptide-free lipid bilayers, attached Abeta42 peptides (i) increase the order parameters of the lipid tails but (ii) decrease the effective width of the hydrophobic region, (iii) reduce the free energy and thus enlarge the density of membrane pores, and (iv) increase the lifetime of pores. A detailed understanding of the interaction of Abeta42 with lipid bilayer membranes may assist in the design of therapeutical strategies against Alzheimer's disease.

24598588|t|Longitudinal change in CSF biomarkers in autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease.
24598588|a|Clinicopathological evidence suggests that the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) begins many years before the appearance of cognitive symptoms. Biomarkers are required to identify affected individuals during this asymptomatic ("preclinical") stage to permit intervention with potential disease-modifying therapies designed to preserve normal brain function. Studies of families with autosomal-dominant AD (ADAD) mutations provide a unique and powerful means to investigate AD biomarker changes during the asymptomatic period. In this biomarker study, we collected cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), plasma, and in vivo amyloid imaging cross-sectional data at baseline in individuals from ADAD families enrolled in the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network. Our study revealed reduced concentrations of CSF amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta1-42) associated with the presence of Abeta plaques, and elevated concentrations of CSF tau, ptau181 (phosphorylated tau181), and VILIP-1 (visinin-like protein-1), markers of neurofibrillary tangles and neuronal injury/death, in asymptomatic mutation carriers 10 to 20 years before their estimated age at symptom onset (EAO) and before the detection of cognitive deficits. When compared longitudinally, however, the concentrations of CSF biomarkers of neuronal injury/death within individuals decreased after their EAO, suggesting a slowing of acute neurodegenerative processes with symptomatic disease progression. These results emphasize the importance of longitudinal, within-person assessment when modeling biomarker trajectories across the course of the disease. If corroborated, this pattern may influence the definition of a positive neurodegenerative biomarker outcome in clinical trials.

24598771|t|GRK5 dysfunction accelerates tau hyperphosphorylation in APP (swe) mice through impaired cholinergic activity.
24598771|a|Recent studies have suggested that G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 5 (GRK5) deficiency plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of early Alzheimer's disease. Mild soluble beta-amyloid accumulation can result in reduced membrane (functional) and elevated cytosolic levels of GRK5. Dysfunction of GRK5 impairs the desensitization of presynaptic muscarinic 2 (M2) autoreceptors, which results in presynaptic M2 hyperactivity and inhibits acetylcholine (ACh) release. GRK dysfunction also promotes a deleterious cycle that further increases beta-amyloid accumulation and exaggerates tau hyperphosphorylation in the hippocampus. However, the pathogenic effect of GRK5 dysfunction through targeting tau hyperphosphorylation remains unclear. Here we examined not only the reduced membrane (functional) and elevated cytosolic levels of GRK5 but also the increased levels of hyperphosphorylated tau in the hippocampi of aged APP(swe) mice (11 months of age). Moreover, western blotting analyses revealed the changes in the location of activity of both protein kinase C (PKC) and glycogen synthase kinase3beta (GSK3beta) in the hippocampus of aged APP(swe) mice in which GRK5 translocation occurred. Moreover, treatment with methoctramine, a selective M2 antagonist, partially corrected the difference between wild-type control mice and GRK5-dysfunctional APP (swe) mice in hippocampal ACh release, PKC and GSK3beta activities, as well as tau hyperphosphorylation. In contrast, the GSK3beta inhibitor lithium chloride significantly reduced tau hyperphosphorylation in GRK5-defective APP (swe) mice, but failed to enhance PKC activity and ACh release in the hippocampi of GRK5-defective APP (swe) mice. Taken together, these findings indicate that GRK5 dysfunction accelerated tau hyperphosphorylation in APP(swe) mice by activating GSK3beta through impaired cholinergic activity.

24599158|t|Unlike twins: an NMR comparison of two alpha-synuclein polymorphs featuring different toxicity.
24599158|a|We structurally compare, using solid-state NMR, two different polymorphs of alpha-synuclein which, as established recently, display contrasting biochemical properties, toxicity, and tropism for cells. We show that both forms, which can each be produced as a pure polymorph, are greatly different in secondary structure. While beta-sheets are the dominating secondary structure elements for both polymorphs, they are markedly divergent in terms of number of elements, as well as their distribution. We demonstrate that all identified beta-sheets feature an in-register parallel stacking for both polymorphs. The two forms show a different molecular arrangement in the unit cell and distinct dynamic features, while sharing a highly flexible C-terminal domain. The use of reproducible, well-identified conditions for sample preparation and the recording of identical NMR experiments allows for a direct comparison of the results.

24599465|t|Age-dependent, non-cell-autonomous deposition of amyloid from synthesis of beta-amyloid by cells other than excitatory neurons.
24599465|a|Rare, familial, early-onset autosomal dominant forms of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) are caused by mutations in genes encoding beta-amyloid (Abeta) precursor protein (APP), presenilin-1 (PS1), and presenilin-2. Each of these genes is expressed ubiquitously throughout the CNS, but a widely held view is that excitatory neurons are the primary (or sole) source of the Abeta peptides that promote synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. These efforts notwithstanding, APP and the enzymes required for Abeta production are synthesized by many additional cell types, and the degree to which those cells contribute to the production of Abeta that drives deposition in the CNS has not been tested. We generated transgenic mice in which expression of an ubiquitously expressed, FAD-linked mutant PSEN1 gene was selectively inactivated within postnatal forebrain excitatory neurons, with continued synthesis in all other cells in the CNS. When combined with an additional transgene encoding an FAD-linked APP "Swedish" variant that is synthesized broadly within the CNS, cerebral Abeta deposition during aging was found to be unaffected relative to mice with continued mutant PS1 synthesis in excitatory neurons. Thus, Abeta accumulation is non-cell autonomous, with the primary age-dependent contribution to cerebral Abeta deposition arising from mutant PS1-dependent cleavage of APP within cells other than excitatory neurons.

24599756|t|Complexing Abeta prevents the cellular anomalies induced by the Peptide alone.
24599756|a|Retention of intracellular secreted APP (isAPP) can be provoked by the neurotoxic peptide Abeta. The latter decreases in the cerebrospinal fluid of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, as a consequence of its cerebral accumulation and deposition into senile plaques. Of similar relevance, secreted APP (sAPP) levels can be associated with AD. The studies here presented, reinforce the link between sAPP and Abeta and address putative therapeutic strategies. Laminin and gelsolin are potential candidates; both prevent Abeta fibril formation by complexing with Abeta, thus attenuating its neurotoxicity. We show that preincubation of Abeta with laminin and gelsolin has the effect of rendering it less potent to isAPP accumulation in cortical neurons. This appears to be related to a decrease in F-actin polymerization, whereas Abeta alone induces the polymerization. Further, Abeta decreases gelsolin levels, and the latter is involved in Abeta removal. Our data indicates that Abeta-laminin and Abeta-gelsolin complexes are less neurotoxic and also less potent than fibrillar Abeta at inducing isAPP retention. These results validate the potential of these proteins as therapeutic strategies that prevent the Abeta-induced effects. In hence, given that Abeta decreases the levels of proteins involved in its own clearance, this may contribute to the mechanisms underlying AD pathology.

24601543|t|Retro-inversal of intracellular selected beta-amyloid-interacting peptides: implications for a novel Alzheimer's disease treatment.
24601543|a|The aggregation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) into toxic oligomers is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease pathology. Here we present a novel approach for the development of peptides capable of preventing amyloid aggregation based upon the previous selection of natural all-l peptides that bind Abeta1-42. Using an intracellular selection system, successful library members were further screened via competition selection to identify the most effective peptides capable of reducing amyloid levels. To circumvent potential issues arising from stability and protease action for these structures, we have replaced all l residues with d residues and inverted the sequence. These retro-inverso (RI) peptide analogues therefore encompass reversed sequences that maintain the overall topological order of the native peptides. Our results demonstrate that efficacy in blocking and reversing amyloid formation is maintained while introducing desirable properties to the peptides. Thioflavin-T assays, circular dichroism, and oblique angle fluorescence microscopy collectively indicate that RI peptides can reduce amyloid load, while 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays demonstrate modest reductions in cell toxicity. These conclusions are reinforced using Drosophila melanogaster studies to monitor pupal hatching rates and fly locomotor activity in the presence of RI peptides delivered via RI-trans-activating transcriptional activator peptide fusions. We demonstrate that the RI-protein fragment complementation assay approach can be used as a generalized method for deriving Abeta-interacting peptides. This approach has subsequently led to several peptide candidates being further explored as potential treatments for Alzheimer's disease.

24601594|a|We present ONIOM calculations using density functional theory (DFT) as the high and AM1 as the medium level that explore the abilities of different hexapeptide sequences to terminate the growth of a model for the tau-amyloid implicated in Alzheimer's disease. We delineate and explore several design principles (H-bonding in the side chains, using antiparallel interactions on the growing edge of a parallel sheet, using all-d residues to form rippled interactions at the edge of the sheet, and replacing the H-bond donor N-H's that inhibit further growth) that can be used individually and in combination to design such peptides that will have a greater affinity for binding to the parallel beta-sheet of acetyl-VQIVYK-NHCH3 than the natural sequence and will prevent another strand from binding to the sheet, thus providing a cap to the growing sheet that arrests further growth. We found peptides in which the Q is replaced by an acetyllysine (aK) residue to be particularly promising candidates, particularly if the reverse sequence (KYVIaKV) is used to form an antiparallel interaction with the sheet.

24602800|t|Temsirolimus promotes autophagic clearance of amyloid-beta and provides protective effects in cellular and animal models of Alzheimer's disease.
24602800|a|Accumulation of amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) within brain is a major pathogenic hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Emerging evidence suggests that autophagy, an important intracellular catabolic process, is involved in Abeta clearance. Here, we investigated whether temsirolimus, a newly developed compound approved by Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency for renal cell carcinoma treatment, would promote autophagic clearance of Abeta and thus provide protective effects in cellular and animal models of AD. HEK293 cells expressing the Swedish mutant of APP695 (HEK293-APP695) were treated with vehicle or 100nM temsirolimus for 24h in the presence or absence of 3-methyladenine (5mM) or Atg5-siRNA, and intracellular Abeta levels as well as autophagy biomarkers were measured. Meanwhile, APP/PS1 mice received intraperitoneal injection of temsirolimus (20mg/kg) every 2 days for 60 days, and brain Abeta burden, autophagy biomarkers, cellular apoptosis in hippocampus, and spatial cognitive functions were assessed. Our results showed that temsirolimus enhanced Abeta clearance in HEK293-APP695 cells and in brain of APP/PS1 mice in an autophagy-dependent manner. Meanwhile, temsirolimus attenuated cellular apoptosis in hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice, which was accompanied by an improvement in spatial learning and memory abilities. In conclusion, our study provides the first evidence that temsirolimus promotes autophagic Abeta clearance and exerts protective effects in cellular and animal models of AD, suggesting that temsirolimus administration may represent a new therapeutic strategy for AD treatment. Meanwhile, these findings emphasize the notion that many therapeutic agents possess pleiotropic actions aside from their main applications.

24603946|t|Specific targeting of tau oligomers in Htau mice prevents cognitive impairment and tau toxicity following injection with brain-derived tau oligomeric seeds.
24603946|a|Neurodegenerative disease is one of the greatest health crises in the world and as life expectancy rises, the number of people affected will continue to increase. The most common neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer's disease, is a tauopathy, characterized by the presence of aggregated tau, namely in the form of neurofibrillary tangles. Historically, neurofibrillary tangles have been considered the main tau species of interest in Alzheimer's disease; however, we and others have shown that tau oligomers may be the most toxic form and the species responsible for the spread of pathology. We developed a novel anti-tau oligomer-specific mouse monoclonal antibody (TOMA) and investigated the potential of anti-tau oligomer passive immunization in preventing the toxicity of tau pathology in Htau mice. We injected pure brain-derived tau oligomers intracerebrally in 3-month-old wild-type and Htau mice and investigated the protective effects of a single 60 mug TOMA injection when compared to the same dose of non-specific IgG and found that TOMA conferred protection against the accumulation of tau oligomers and cognitive deficits for up to 1 month after treatment. Additionally, we injected pure brain-derived tau oligomers intracerebrally in 3-month-old wild-type and Htau mice and treated animals with biweekly injections of 60 mug TOMA or non-specific IgG. We found that long-term administration of TOMA was effective as a preventative therapy, inhibiting oligomeric tau and preserving memory function. These results support the critical role of oligomeric tau in disease progression and validate tau oligomers as a potential drug target.

24605449|t|Seasonal variation in spatial distributions of Anopheles gambiae in a Sahelian village: evidence for aestivation.
24605449|a|Changes in spatial distribution of mosquitoes over time in a Sahelian village were studied to understand the sources of the mosquitoes during the dry season when no larval sites are found. At that time, the sources of Anopheles gambiae Giles may be local shelters used by aestivating mosquitoes or migrants from distant populations. The mosquito distribution was more aggregated during the dry season, when few houses had densities 7- to 24-fold higher than expected. The high-density houses during the dry season differed from those of the wet season. Most high-density houses during the dry season changed between years, yet their vicinity was rather stable. Scan statistics confirmed the presence of one or two adjacent hotspots in the dry season, usually found on one edge of the village. These hotspots shifted between the early and late dry season. During the wet season, the hotspots were relatively stable near the main larval site. The locations of the hotspots in the wet season and early and late dry season were similar between years. Season-specific, stable, and focal hotspots are inconsistent with the predictions based on the arrival of migrants from distant localities during the dry season, but are consistent with the predictions based on local shelters used by aestivating mosquitoes. Targeting hotspots in Sahelian villages for vector control may not be effective because the degree of aggregation is moderate, the hotspots are not easily predicted, and they are not the sources of the population. However, targeting the dry-season shelters may be highly cost-effective, once they can be identified and predicted.

24606351|t|Amyloid oligomer structure characterization from simulations: a general method.
24606351|a|Amyloid oligomers and plaques are composed of multiple chemically identical proteins. Therefore, one of the first fundamental problems in the characterization of structures from simulations is the treatment of the degeneracy, i.e., the permutation of the molecules. Second, the intramolecular and intermolecular degrees of freedom of the various molecules must be taken into account. Currently, the well-known dihedral principal component analysis method only considers the intramolecular degrees of freedom, and other methods employing collective variables can only describe intermolecular degrees of freedom at the global level. With this in mind, we propose a general method that identifies all the structures accurately. The basis idea is that the intramolecular and intermolecular states are described in terms of combinations of single-molecule and double-molecule states, respectively, and the overall structures of oligomers are the product basis of the intramolecular and intermolecular states. This way, the degeneracy is automatically avoided. The method is illustrated on the conformational ensemble of the tetramer of the Alzheimer's peptide Abeta9-40, resulting from two atomistic molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent, each of 200 ns, starting from two distinct structures.

24607832|t|Variance in the identification of microRNAs deregulated in Alzheimer's disease and possible role of lincRNAs in the pathology: the need of larger datasets.
24607832|a|Non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs, represent the next major step in understanding the complexity of gene regulation and expression. In the past decade, tremendous efforts have been put mainly into identifying microRNAs that are changed in Alzheimer's disease, with the goal to provide biomarkers of the disease and to better characterize molecular pathways that are deregulated concomitantly to the formation of Tau and amyloid aggregates. This review underlines the importance of correctly defining, in a deluge of high-throughput data, which microRNAs are abnormally expressed in Alzheimer's disease patients. Despite a clear lack of consensus on the topic, miR-132 is emerging as a neuronal microRNA being gradually down-regulated during disease and showing important roles in the maintenance of brain integrity. Insight into the biological importance of other classes of non-coding RNAs also rapidly increased over the last years and therefore we discuss the possible implication of long non-coding RNAs in Alzheimer's disease.

24607960|t|Mild cognitive impairment and asymptomatic Alzheimer disease subjects: equivalent beta-amyloid and tau loads with divergent cognitive outcomes.
24607960|a|Older adults with intact cognition before death and substantial Alzheimer disease (AD) lesions at autopsy have been termed "asymptomatic AD subjects" (ASYMAD). We previously reported hypertrophy of neuronal cell bodies, nuclei, and nucleoli in the CA1 of the hippocampus (CA1), anterior cingulate gyrus, posterior cingulate gyrus, and primary visual cortex of ASYMAD versus age-matched Control and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects. However, it was unclear whether the neuronal hypertrophy could be attributed to differences in the severity of AD pathology. Here, we performed quantitative analyses of the severity of beta-amyloid (Abeta) and phosphorylated tau (tau) loads in the brains of ASYMAD, Control, MCI, and AD subjects (n = 15 per group) from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Tissue sections from CA1, anterior cingulate gyrus, posterior cingulate gyrus, and primary visual cortex were immunostained for Abeta and tau; the respective loads were assessed using unbiased stereology by measuring the fractional areas of immunoreactivity for each protein in each region. The ASYMAD and MCI groups did not differ in Abeta and tau loads. These data confirm that ASYMAD and MCI subjects have comparable loads of insoluble Abeta and tau in regions vulnerable to AD pathology despite divergent cognitive outcomes. These findings imply that cognitive impairment in AD may be caused or modulated by factors other than insoluble forms of Abeta and tau.

24607962|t|Age-related brain expression and regulation of the chemokine CCL4/MIP-1beta in APP/PS1 double-transgenic mice.
24607962|a|The detrimental effect of activation of the chemokine CCL4/MIP-1beta on neuronal integrity in patients with HIV-associated dementia has directed attention to the potential role of CCL4 expression and regulation in Alzheimer disease. Here, we show that CCL4 mRNA and protein are overexpressed in the brains of APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 (APP/PS1) double-transgenic mice, a model of cerebral amyloid deposition; expression was minimal in brains from nontransgenic littermates or single-mutant controls. Increased levels of CCL4 mRNA and protein directly correlated with the age-related progression of cerebral amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels in APP/PS1 mice. We also found significantly increased expression of activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), which was positively correlated with age-related Abeta deposition and CCL4 in the brains of APP/PS1 mice. Results from chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative polymerase chain reaction confirmed that ATF3 binds to the promoter region of the CCL4 gene, consistent with a potential role in regulating CCL4 transcription. Finally, elevated ATF3 mRNA expression in APP/PS1 brains was associated with hypomethylation of the ATF3 gene promoter region. These observations prompt the testable hypothesis for future study that CCL4 overexpression, regulated in part by hypomethylation of the ATF3 gene, may contribute to neuropathologic progression associated with amyloid deposition in Alzheimer disease.

24612036|t|Up-regulation of beta-amyloidogenesis in neuron-like human cells by both 24- and 27-hydroxycholesterol: protective effect of N-acetyl-cysteine.
24612036|a|An abnormal accumulation of cholesterol oxidation products in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) would further link an impaired cholesterol metabolism in the pathogenesis of the disease. The first evidence stemming from the content of oxysterols in autopsy samples from AD and normal brains points to an increase in both 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OH) and 24-hydroxycholesterol (24-OH) in the frontal cortex of AD brains, with a trend that appears related to the disease severity. The challenge of differentiated SK-N-BE human neuroblastoma cells with patho-physiologically relevant amounts of 27-OH and 24-OH showed that both oxysterols induce a net synthesis of Abeta1-42 by up-regulating expression levels of amyloid precursor protein and beta-secretase, as well as the beta-secretase activity. Interestingly, cell pretreatment with N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) fully prevented the enhancement of beta-amyloidogenesis induced by the two oxysterols. The reported findings link an impaired cholesterol oxidative metabolism to an excessive beta-amyloidogenesis and point to NAC as an efficient inhibitor of oxysterols-induced Abeta toxic peptide accumulation in the brain.

24613195|t|Small vessel disease, but neither amyloid load nor metabolic deficit, is dependent on age at onset in Alzheimer's disease.
24613195|a|BACKGROUND: There is controversy concerning whether Alzheimer's disease (AD) with early onset is distinct from AD with late onset with regard to amyloid pathology and neuronal metabolic deficit. We hypothesized that compared with patients with early-onset AD, patients with late-onset AD have more comorbid small vessel disease (SVD) contributing to clinical severity, whereas there are no differences in amyloid pathology and neuronal metabolic deficit. METHODS: The study included two groups of patients with probable AD dementia with evidence of the AD pathophysiologic process: 24 patients with age at onset <60 years old and 36 patients with age at onset >70 years old. Amyloid deposition was assessed using carbon-11-labeled Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography, comorbid SVD was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging, and neuronal metabolic deficit was assessed using fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. Group differences of global and regional distribution of pathology were explored using region of interest and voxel-based analyses, respectively, carefully controlling for the influence of dementia severity, apolipoprotein E genotype, and in particular SVD. The pattern of cognitive impairment was determined using z scores of the subtests of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Neuropsychological Assessment Battery. RESULTS: Patients with late-onset AD showed a significantly greater amount of SVD. No statistically significant differences in global or regional amyloid deposition or neuronal metabolic deficit between the two groups were revealed. However, when not controlling for SVD, subtle differences in fluorodeoxyglucose uptake between early-onset AD and late-onset AD groups were detectable. There were no significant differences regarding cognitive functioning. CONCLUSIONS: Age at onset does not influence amyloid deposition or neuronal metabolic deficit in AD. The greater extent of SVD in late-onset AD influences the association between neuronal metabolic deficit and clinical symptoms.

24613704|t|Genetic interaction of PICALM and APOE is associated with brain atrophy and cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease.
24613704|a|BACKGROUND: Evidence has emerged indicating that the epsilon4 allele of APOE and PICALM interact in conferring risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The biologic basis of this interaction is unclear, but it is likely to have phenotypic relevance and contribute to the structural and clinical heterogeneity of AD. METHODS: The aim of this study was to investigate interaction effects of the APOE epsilon4 allele and the alleles at the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs3851179 located in the PICALM locus. We analyzed brain volumes and cognitive phenotypes of 165 patients with early AD dementia. RESULTS: There was a synergistic adverse effect of homozygosity for the PICALM risk allele G in rs3851179 and APOE epsilon4 on volume in prefrontal and performance on the Trail Making Test A, which is sensitive to processing speed and working memory function. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest a neural mechanism for APOE-PICALM interactions in patients with manifest AD and indicate that the PICALM genotype modulates both brain atrophy and cognitive performance in APOE epsilon4 carriers.

24614265|t|Practice effects and amyloid deposition: preliminary data on a method for enriching samples in clinical trials.
24614265|a|Clinical trials in Alzheimer disease are moving toward prevention studies in prodromal individuals with amyloid burden. However, methods are needed to identify individuals expected to be amyloid positive for these studies to be feasible and cost-effective. The current study sought to determine whether short-term practice effects on cognitive tests can identify those with notable uptake on amyloid imaging. Twenty-five, nondemented older adults (15 cognitively intact, 10 with mild cognitive impairment) underwent amyloid imaging through F-flutemetamol and 2 cognitive testing sessions across 1 week to determine practice effects on a visual memory test. Results indicated that, whereas F-flutemetamol uptake showed little association with baseline performance on a visual memory test (r=-0.04, P=0.85), it was significantly correlated with practice effects across 1 week on that same memory measure (r=-0.45, P=0.02), with greater uptake being associated with lower practice effects. The odds ratio of notable F-flutemetamol uptake was 5 times higher in individuals with low practice effects compared with high practice effects. Although these preliminary results need to be replicated in larger samples, short-term practice effects on cognitive tests may provide an affordable screening method to identify individuals who are amyloid positive, which could enrich samples for preventative clinical trials in Alzheimer disease.

24614494|t|Florbetapir F 18 amyloid PET and 36-month cognitive decline: a prospective multicenter study.
24614494|a|This study was designed to evaluate whether subjects with amyloid beta (Abeta) pathology, detected using florbetapir positron emission tomorgraphy (PET), demonstrated greater cognitive decline than subjects without Abeta pathology. Sixty-nine cognitively normal (CN) controls, 52 with recently diagnosed mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 31 with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia were included in the study. PET images obtained in these subjects were visually rated as positive (Abeta+) or negative (Abeta-), blind to diagnosis. Fourteen percent (10/69) of CN, 37% (19/52) of MCI and 68% (21/31) of AD were Abeta+. The primary outcome was change in ADAS-Cog score in MCI subjects after 36 months; however, additional outcomes included change on measures of cognition, function and diagnostic status. Abeta+ MCI subjects demonstrated greater worsening compared with Abeta- subjects on the ADAS-Cog over 36 months (5.66 +- 1.47 vs -0.71 +- 1.09, P = 0.0014) as well as on the mini-mental state exam (MMSE), digit symbol substitution (DSS) test, and a verbal fluency test (P < 0.05). Similar to MCI subjects, Abeta+ CN subjects showed greater decline on the ADAS-Cog, digit-symbol-substitution test and verbal fluency (P<0.05), whereas Abeta+ AD patients showed greater declines in verbal fluency and the MMSE (P < 0.05). Abeta+ subjects in all diagnostic groups also showed greater decline on the CDR-SB (P<0.04), a global clinical assessment. Abeta+ subjects did not show significantly greater declines on the ADCS-ADL or Wechsler Memory Scale. Overall, these findings suggest that in CN, MCI and AD subjects, florbetapir PET Abeta+ subjects show greater cognitive and global deterioration over a 3-year follow-up than Abeta- subjects do.

24614496|t|Intraperitoneal injection of the pancreatic peptide amylin potently reduces behavioral impairment and brain amyloid pathology in murine models of Alzheimer's disease.
24614496|a|Amylin, a pancreatic peptide, and amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta), a major component of Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, share similar beta-sheet secondary structures, but it is not known whether pancreatic amylin affects amyloid pathogenesis in the AD brain. Using AD mouse models, we investigated the effects of amylin and its clinical analog, pramlintide, on AD pathogenesis. Surprisingly, chronic intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of AD animals with either amylin or pramlintide reduces the amyloid burden as well as lowers the concentrations of Abeta in the brain. These treatments significantly improve their learning and memory assessed by two behavioral tests, Y maze and Morris water maze. Both amylin and pramlintide treatments increase the concentrations of Abeta1-42 in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). A single i.p. injection of either peptide also induces a surge of Abeta in the serum, the magnitude of which is proportionate to the amount of Abeta in brain tissue. One intracerebroventricular injection of amylin induces a more significant surge in serum Abeta than one i.p. injection of the peptide. In 330 human plasma samples, a positive association between amylin and Abeta1-42 as well as Abeta1-40 is found only in patients with AD or amnestic mild cognitive impairment. As amylin readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, our study demonstrates that peripheral amylin's action on the central nervous system results in translocation of Abeta from the brain into the CSF and blood that could be an explanation for a positive relationship between amylin and Abeta in blood. As naturally occurring amylin may play a role in regulating Abeta in brain, amylin class peptides may provide a new avenue for both treatment and diagnosis of AD.

24614897|t|Methylglyoxal produced by amyloid-beta peptide-induced nitrotyrosination of triosephosphate isomerase triggers neuronal death in Alzheimer's disease.
24614897|a|Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) aggregates induce nitro-oxidative stress, contributing to the characteristic neurodegeneration found in Alzheimer's disease (AD). One of the most strongly nitrotyrosinated proteins in AD is the triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) enzyme which regulates glycolytic flow, and its efficiency decreased when it is nitrotyrosinated. The main aims of this study were to analyze the impact of TPI nitrotyrosination on cell viability and to identify the mechanism behind this effect. In human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y), we evaluated the effects of Abeta42 oligomers on TPI nitrotyrosination. We found an increased production of methylglyoxal (MG), a toxic byproduct of the inefficient nitro-TPI function. The proapoptotic effects of Abeta42 oligomers, such as decreasing the protective Bcl2 and increasing the proapoptotic caspase-3 and Bax, were prevented with a MG chelator. Moreover, we used a double mutant TPI (Y165F and Y209F) to mimic nitrosative modifications due to Abeta action. Neuroblastoma cells transfected with the double mutant TPI consistently triggered MG production and a decrease in cell viability due to apoptotic mechanisms. Our data show for the first time that MG is playing a key role in the neuronal death induced by Abeta oligomers. This occurs because of TPI nitrotyrosination, which affects both tyrosines associated with the catalytic center.

24614899|t|Vaccination with Sarkosyl insoluble PHF-tau decrease neurofibrillary tangles formation in aged tau transgenic mouse model: a pilot study.
24614899|a|Active immunization using tau phospho-peptides in tauopathy mouse models has been observed to reduce tau pathology, especially when given prior to the onset of pathology. Since tau aggregates in these models and in human tauopathies are composed of full-length tau with many post-translational modifications, and are composed of several tau isoforms in many of them, pathological tau proteins bearing all these post-translational modifications might prove to be optimal tau conformers to use as immunogens, especially in models with advanced tau pathology. To this aim, we immunized aged wild-type and mutant tau mice with preparations containing human paired helical filaments (PHF) emulsified in Alum-adjuvant. This immunization protocol with fibrillar PHF-tau was well tolerated and did not induce an inflammatory reaction in the brain or adverse effect in these aged mice. Mice immunized with four repeated injections developed anti-PHF-tau antibodies with rising titers that labeled human neurofibrillary tangles in situ. Immunized mutant tau mice had a lower density of hippocampal Gallyas-positive neurons. Brain levels of Sarkosyl-insoluble tau were also reduced in immunized mice. These results indicate that an immunization protocol using fibrillar PHF-tau proteins is an efficient and tolerated approach to reduce tau pathology in an aged tauopathy animal model.

24614900|t|Plasma membrane injury depends on bilayer lipid composition in Alzheimer's disease.
24614900|a|Increasing evidence indicates that interaction of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) with the cell membrane is a primary step in Alzheimer's disease (AD) neurotoxicity. In particular, it has been demonstrated that lipid rafts are key sites of Abeta production, aggregation, and interaction with the cell membrane. In this study we show that Abeta42 oligomers are recruited to lipid rafts, leading to plasma membrane perturbation and Ca2+ dyshomeostasis in primary fibroblasts from familial AD patients bearing APPVal717Ile, PS-1Leu392Val, or PS-1Met146Leu gene mutations. In contrast, a moderate increase in membrane cholesterol content precluded the interaction of Abeta42 oligomers with the plasma membrane and resulting cell damage. Moreover, the recruitment of amyloid assemblies to lipid raft domains of cholesterol-depleted fibroblasts was significantly increased, thus triggering an earlier and sharper increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels and plasma membrane permeabilization. Our findings suggest a protective role for raft cholesterol against amyloid toxicity in AD.

24619277|t|Diagnostic utility of amyloid PET in cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage.
24619277|a|By detecting beta-amyloid (Abeta) in the wall of cortical arterioles, amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) imaging might help diagnose cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) in patients with lobar intracerebral hemorrhage (l-ICH). No previous study has directly assessed the diagnostic value of (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET in probable CAA-related l-ICH against healthy controls (HCs). (11)C-PiB-PET and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including T2* were obtained in 11 nondemented patients fulfilling the Boston criteria for probable CAA-related symptomatic l-ICH (sl-ICH) and 20 HCs without cognitive complaints or impairment. After optimal spatial normalization, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF)-corrected PiB distribution volume ratios (DVRs) were obtained. There was no significant difference in whole cortex or regional DVRs between CAA patients and age-matched HCs. The whole cortex DVR was above the 95% confidence limit in 4/9 HCs and 10/11 CAA patients (sensitivity=91%, specificity=55%). Region/frontal or occipital ratios did not have better discriminative value. Similar but less accurate results were found using visual analysis. In patients with sl-ICH, (11)C-PiB-PET has low specificity for CAA due to the frequent occurrence of high (11)C-PiB uptake in the healthy elderly reflecting incipient Alzheimer's disease (AD), which might also be present in suspected CAA. However, a negative PiB scan rules out CAA with excellent sensitivity, which has clinical implications for prognostication and selection of candidates for drug trials.

24620716|t|Complex relationships between substrate sequence and sensitivity to alterations in gamma-secretase processivity induced by gamma-secretase modulators.
24620716|a|gamma-Secretase catalyzes the final cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), resulting in the production of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides with different carboxyl termini. Presenilin (PSEN) and amyloid precursor protein (APP) mutations linked to early onset familial Alzheimer's disease modify the profile of Abeta isoforms generated, by altering both the initial gamma-secretase cleavage site and subsequent processivity in a manner that leads to increased levels of the more amyloidogenic Abeta42 and in some circumstances Abeta43. Compounds termed gamma-secretase modulators (GSMs) and inverse GSMs (iGSMs) can decrease and increase levels of Abeta42, respectively. As GSMs lower the level of production of pathogenic forms of long Abeta isoforms, they are of great interest as potential Alzheimer's disease therapeutics. The factors that regulate GSM modulation are not fully understood; however, there is a growing body of evidence that supports the hypothesis that GSM activity is influenced by the amino acid sequence of the gamma-secretase substrate. We have evaluated whether mutations near the luminal border of the transmembrane domain (TMD) of APP alter the ability of both acidic, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-derived carboxylate and nonacidic, phenylimidazole-derived classes of GSMs and iGSMs to modulate gamma-secretase cleavage. Our data show that point mutations can dramatically reduce the sensitivity to modulation of cleavage by GSMs but have weaker effects on iGSM activity. These studies support the concept that the effect of GSMs may be substrate selective; for APP, it is dependent on the amino acid sequence of the substrate near the junction of the extracellular domain and luminal segment of the TMD.

24621265|t|Aggravation of Alzheimer's disease due to the COX-2-mediated reciprocal regulation of IL-1beta and Abeta between glial and neuron cells.
24621265|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and displays the characteristics of chronic neurodegenerative disorders; amyloid plaques (AP) that contain amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) accumulate in AD, which is also characterized by tau phosphorylation. Epidemiological evidence has demonstrated that long-term treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) markedly reduces the risk of AD by inhibiting the expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2). Although the levels of COX-2 and its metabolic product prostaglandin (PG)E2 are elevated in the brain of AD patients, the mechanisms for the development of AD remain unknown. Using human- or mouse-derived glioblastoma and neuroblastoma cell lines as model systems, we delineated the signaling pathways by which COX-2 mediates the reciprocal regulation of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and Abeta between glial and neuron cells. In glioblastoma cells, COX-2 regulates the synthesis of IL-1beta in a PGE2 -dependent manner. Moreover, COX-2-derived PGE2 signals the activation of the PI3-K/AKT and PKA/CREB pathways via cyclic AMP; these pathways transactivate the NF-kappaB p65 subunit via phosphorylation at Ser 536 and Ser 276, leading to IL-1beta synthesis. The secretion of IL-1beta from glioblastoma cells in turn stimulates the expression of COX-2 in human or mouse neuroblastoma cells. Similar regulatory mechanisms were found for the COX-2 regulation of BACE-1 expression in neuroblastoma cells. More importantly, Abeta deposition mediated the inflammatory response of glial cells via inducing the expression of COX-2 in glioblastoma cells. These findings not only provide new insights into the mechanisms of COX-2-induced AD but also initially define the therapeutic targets of AD.

24621957|t|Identification and quantification of amyloid beta-related peptides in human plasma using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
24621957|a|Proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-secretase and gamma-secretase leads to the generation and deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). N-terminally or C-terminally truncated Abeta variants have been found in human cerebrospinal fluid and cultured cell media using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. Unfortunately, the profile of plasma Abeta variants has not been revealed due to the difficulty of isolating Abeta from plasma. We present here for the first time studies of Abeta and related peptides in human plasma. Twenty-two Abeta-related peptides including novel peptides truncated before the beta-secretase site were detected in human plasma and 20 of the peptides were identified by tandem mass spectrometry. Using an internal standard, we developed a quantitative assay for the Abeta-related peptides and demonstrated plasma dilution linearity and the precision required for their quantitation. The present method should enhance the understanding of APP processing and clearance in AD progression.

24623176|t|Sex modifies the APOE-related risk of developing Alzheimer disease.
24623176|a|OBJECTIVE: The APOE4 allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD). Case-control studies suggest the APOE4 link to AD is stronger in women. We examined the APOE4-by-sex interaction in conversion risk (from healthy aging to mild cognitive impairment (MCI)/AD or from MCI to AD) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker levels. METHODS: Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) for an APOE-by-sex interaction on conversion in controls (n = 5,496) and MCI patients (n = 2,588). The interaction was also tested in CSF biomarker levels of 980 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. RESULTS: Among controls, male and female carriers were more likely to convert to MCI/AD, but the effect was stronger in women (HR = 1.81 for women; HR = 1.27 for men; interaction: p = 0.011). The interaction remained significant in a predefined subanalysis restricted to APOE3/3 and APOE3/4 genotypes. Among MCI patients, both male and female APOE4 carriers were more likely to convert to AD (HR = 2.16 for women; HR = 1.64 for men); the interaction was not significant (p = 0.14). In the subanalysis restricted to APOE3/3 and APOE3/4 genotypes, the interaction was significant (p = 0.02; HR = 2.17 for women; HR = 1.51 for men). The APOE4-by-sex interaction on biomarker levels was significant for MCI patients for total tau and the tau-to-Abeta ratio (p = 0.009 and p = 0.02, respectively; more AD-like in women). INTERPRETATION: APOE4 confers greater AD risk in women. Biomarker results suggest that increased APOE-related risk in women may be associated with tau pathology. These findings have important clinical implications and suggest novel research approaches into AD pathogenesis.

24623782|t|PPARgamma recruitment to active ERK during memory consolidation is required for Alzheimer's disease-related cognitive enhancement.
24623782|a|Cognitive impairment is a quintessential feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD mouse models. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) agonist rosiglitazone improves hippocampus-dependent cognitive deficits in some AD patients and ameliorates deficits in the Tg2576 mouse model for AD amyloidosis. Tg2576 cognitive enhancement occurs through the induction of a gene and protein expression profile reflecting convergence of the PPARgamma signaling axis and the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) cascade, a critical mediator of memory consolidation. We therefore tested whether PPARgamma and ERK associated in protein complexes that subserve cognitive enhancement through PPARgamma agonism. Coimmunoprecipitation of hippocampal extracts revealed that PPARgamma and activated, phosphorylated ERK (pERK) associated in Tg2576 in vivo, and that PPARgamma agonism facilitated recruitment of PPARgamma to pERK during memory consolidation. Furthermore, the amount of PPARgamma recruited to pERK correlated with the cognitive reserve in humans with AD and in Tg2576. Our findings implicate a previously unidentified PPARgamma-pERK complex that provides a molecular mechanism for the convergence of these pathways during cognitive enhancement, thereby offering new targets for therapeutic development in AD.

24623839|t|Incidence of cerebral microbleeds in preclinical Alzheimer disease.
24623839|a|OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the incidence and associations of lobar microbleeds (LMBs) in a longitudinal cohort with (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET imaging. METHODS: One hundred seventy-four participants from the observational Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Study of Ageing (97 with normal cognition [NC], 37 with mild cognitive impairment [MCI], and 40 with Alzheimer disease [AD] dementia) were assessed at 3 time points over 3 years with 3-tesla susceptibility-weighted MRI and (11)C-PiB PET. MRIs were inspected for microbleeds, siderosis, infarction, and white matter hyperintensity severity, blind to clinical and PiB findings. Neocortical PiB standardized uptake value ratio, normalized to cerebellar cortex, was dichotomized as positive or negative (PiB+/-, standardized uptake value ratio >1.5). Annualized LMB incidence was calculated, and logistic regression was used to determine the association of incident LMBs with PiB, APOE epsilon4+ status, and cerebrovascular disease. RESULTS: LMBs were present in 18.6% of NC, 24.3% of MCI, and 40% of AD participants (p < 0.05 vs NC). LMB incidence was 0.2 +- 0.6 per year in NC participants, 0.2 +- 0.5 in MCI, and 0.7 +- 1.4 in AD (p < 0.03 vs NC) and was 6-fold higher in PiB+ than PiB-NC. Incident LMBs were associated with age, APOE epsilon4+, PiB+, and baseline LMBs. Incidence of multiple LMBs was also associated with lacunar infarction and white matter hyperintensity severity. CONCLUSIONS: Older age, baseline LMBs, higher beta-amyloid burden, and concomitant cerebrovascular disease may all confer higher risk of incident LMBs. This should be considered when designing protocols for amyloid-modifying clinical trials.

24625793|t|Pyruvate carboxylase and pentose phosphate fluxes are reduced in AbetaPP-PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease: a 13C NMR study.
24625793|a|Although pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is the major pathway of glucose metabolism and source for energy production, pyruvate carboxylase (PC) and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) account for a significant fraction of glucose oxidation in the mature central nervous system. Flux through the PDH pathway has been reported to be reduced in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients as well as in animal models of AD. However, fluxes through the PPP and PC pathways have not been explored under conditions of AD. The present study investigates the fluxes of PC and PPP in a 20-month-old AbetaPP-PS1 mouse model of AD using 13C NMR spectroscopy together with an infusion of [2-13C]glucose. Mice were also administered [1,6-13C2]glucose or [1-13C]glucose for 10 or 90 min, respectively, to investigate PDH flux. AbetaPP-PS1 mice exhibit a significant reduction in the level of NAA and increase in level of myo-inositol. The flux through PDH was found to be significantly lower in the cerebral cortex (AbetaPP-PS1 0.39 +- 0.08; control 0.77 +- 0.08 mumol/g/min), hippocampus (AbetaPP-PS1 0.31 +- 0.04; control 0.64 +- 0.12 mumol/g/min), and striatum (AbetaPP-PS1 0.34 +- 0.06; control 0.56 +- 0.03 mumol/g/min) of AbetaPP-PS1 as compared with control mice. The fluxes through PC (AbetaPP-PS1 0.037 +- 0.006, control 0.079 +- 0.013 mumol/g/min) and PPP (AbetaPP-PS1 0.024 +- 0.005; control 0.062 +- 0.022 mumol/g/min) were found to be significantly reduced in AbetaPP-PS1 mice when compared with age-matched controls. The reduction in the fluxes of PC and PPP may lead to a weakened neural defense system of ammonia detoxification and antioxidant reserve in AbetaPP-PS1 mice, which may be responsible for the compromised neuronal viability and functions in AD.

24625798|t|Synergistic inhibition of synaptic signaling in cortical cultures by subcytotoxic levels of oligomerized amyloid-beta and iron: alleviation by zinc.
24625798|a|Iron exacerbates amyloid-beta (Abeta) toxicity, while zinc alleviates it. We examined the impact of these metals on Abeta-induced signaling inhibition. Murine embryonic cortical neurons on multi-electrode arrays received 0.1 muM FeCl2 0.1 muM zinc acetate and/or 10 nM oligomerized Abeta(1-42). No toxicity was observed. Spontaneous signaling was not altered by iron or Abeta individually, but was inhibited by both. Zinc did not impact signaling alone, but prevented inhibition by iron plus Abeta. Abeta can be detected years before cognitive decline. Subcytotoxic iron levels may potentiate Abeta-induced impairment of synaptic activity during these early stages; zinc supplementation may alleviate this potentiation.

24625800|t|Strikingly reduced amyloid burden and improved behavioral performance in Alzheimer's disease mice immunized with recombinant chimeric vaccines by hexavalent foldable Abeta1-15 fused to toxin-derived carrier proteins.
24625800|a|Targeting on the amyloid-beta (Abeta) is a promising immunotherapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, Abeta(1-15) sequence alone induces low antibody response and poor protection against AD. We describe here the immunological characterization and protective efficacy of several recombinant chimeric vaccines with hexavalent foldable Abeta(1-15) (6Abeta15) fused to PADRE or toxin-derived carrier proteins. Immunization with these chimeric antigens generated robust Th2 immune responses with high anti-Abeta42 antibody titers in different mice, which recognized neurotoxic Abeta42 oligomers, but did not stimulate Abeta42-specific T cell responses. These 6Abeta15 chimeric vaccines markedly reduced Abeta pathology and prevented development of behavioral deficits in immunized older AD mice. Importantly, toxin-derived carrier proteins as molecular adjuvants of chimeric vaccines could substantially boost immune responses and overcome Abeta- and old age-associated hypo-responsiveness, and elicit long-term Abeta-specific antibody response, which in turn inhibited Abeta-mediated pathology and improved acquisition and retention of spatial memory in immunized AD mice. These data indicate that toxin fragments as molecular adjuvants are promising new tools for the rational design and development of prototype chimeric vaccines for AD and this type of chimeric vaccine design has the added advantage of overcoming hypo-responsiveness in elderly AD patients with pre-existing memory Th cells from tetanus toxin.

24625803|t|Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) reduces amyloid-beta protein misfolding in vitro.
24625803|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating disease of aging that initiates decades prior to clinical manifestation and represents an impending epidemic. Two early features of AD are metabolic dysfunction and changes in amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) levels. Since levels of ATP decrease over the course of the disease and Abeta is an early biomarker of AD, we sought to uncover novel linkages between the two. First and remarkably, a GxxxG motif is common between both Abeta (oligomerization motif) and nucleotide binding proteins (Rossmann fold). Second, ATP was demonstrated to protect against Abeta mediated cytotoxicity. Last, there is structural similarity between ATP and amyloid binding/inhibitory compounds such as ThioT, melatonin, and indoles. Thus, we investigated whether ATP alters misfolding of the pathologically relevant Abeta42. To test this hypothesis, we performed computational and biochemical studies. Our computational studies demonstrate that ATP interacts strongly with Tyr10 and Ser26 of Abeta fibrils in solution. Experimentally, both ATP and ADP reduced Abeta misfolding at physiological intracellular concentrations, with thresholds at ~500 muM and 1 mM respectively. This inhibition of Abeta misfolding is specific; requiring Tyr10 of Abeta and is enhanced by magnesium. Last, cerebrospinal fluid ATP levels are in the nanomolar range and decreased with AD pathology. This initial and novel finding regarding the ATP interaction with Abeta and reduction of Abeta misfolding has potential significance to the AD field. It provides an underlying mechanism for published links between metabolic dysfunction and AD. It also suggests a potential role of ATP in AD pathology, as the occurrence of misfolded extracellular Abeta mirrors lowered extracellular ATP levels. Last, the findings suggest that Abeta conformation change may be a sensor of metabolic dysfunction.

24628027|t|Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with photoswitchable inhibition of beta-amyloid aggregation.
24628027|a|Photochromic cholinesterase inhibitors were obtained from cis-1,2-alpha-dithienylethene-based compounds by incorporating one or two aminopolymethylene tacrine groups. All target compounds are potent acetyl- (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitors in the nanomolar concentration range. Compound 11b bearing an octylene linker exhibited interactions with both the catalytic active site (CAS) and the peripheral anionic site (PAS) of AChE. Yet upon irradiation with light, the mechanism of interaction varied from one photochromic form to another, which was investigated by kinetic studies and proved "photoswitchable". The AChE-induced beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregation assay gave further experimental support to this finding: Abeta1-40 aggregation catalyzed by the PAS of AChE might be inhibited by compound 11b in a concentration-dependent manner and seems to occur only with one photochromic form. Computational docking studies provided potential binding modes of the compound. Docking studies and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for the ring-open and -closed form indicate a difference in binding. Although both forms can interact with the PAS, more stable interactions are observed for the ring-open form based upon stabilization of a water molecule network within the enzyme, whereas the ring-closed form lacks the required conformational flexibility for an analogous binding mode. The photoswitchable inhibitor identified might serve as valuable molecular tool to investigate the different biological properties of AChE as well as its role in pathogenesis of AD in in vitro assays.

24632309|t|Beyond pathology: APP, brain development and Alzheimer's disease.
24632309|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia among the elderly. Research in the AD field has been mostly focused on the biology of the Abeta peptide but increasing evidence is shifting attention toward the physiological role of APP as key to understanding AD pathology. It is becoming apparent that APP plays a central role in the mechanisms that guarantee the accuracy and the robustness of brain wiring. In the present review we explore APP functions with focus on some of the underlying molecular mechanisms.

24632990|t|Diagnostic criteria for vascular cognitive disorders: a VASCOG statement.
24632990|a|BACKGROUND: Several sets of diagnostic criteria have been published for vascular dementia since the 1960s. The continuing ambiguity in vascular dementia definition warrants a critical reexamination. METHODS: Participants at a special symposium of the International Society for Vascular Behavioral and Cognitive Disorders (VASCOG) in 2009 critiqued the current criteria. They drafted a proposal for a new set of criteria, later reviewed through multiple drafts by the group, including additional experts and the members of the Neurocognitive Disorders Work Group of the fifth revision of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5) Task Force. RESULTS: Cognitive disorders of vascular etiology are a heterogeneous group of disorders with diverse pathologies and clinical manifestations, discussed broadly under the rubric of vascular cognitive disorders (VCD). The continuum of vascular cognitive impairment is recognized by the categories of Mild Vascular Cognitive Disorder, and Vascular Dementia or Major Vascular Cognitive Disorder. Diagnostic thresholds are defined. Clinical and neuroimaging criteria are proposed for establishing vascular etiology. Subtypes of VCD are described, and the frequent cooccurrence of Alzheimer disease pathology emphasized. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed criteria for VCD provide a coherent approach to the diagnosis of this diverse group of disorders, with a view to stimulating clinical and pathologic validation studies. These criteria can be harmonized with the DSM-5 criteria such that an international consensus on the criteria for VCD may be achieved.

24633805|t|Total apolipoprotein E levels and specific isoform composition in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma from Alzheimer's disease patients and controls.
24633805|a|The apolipoprotein E (ApoE) epsilon4 allele is the strongest risk factor of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), however, the fluid concentrations of ApoE and its different isoforms (ApoE2, ApoE3 and ApoE4) in AD patients and among APOE genotypes (APOE epsilon2, epsilon3, epsilon4) remain controversial. Using a novel mass spectrometry-based method, we quantified total ApoE and specific ApoE isoform concentrations and potential associations with age, cognitive status, cholesterol levels and established AD biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from AD patients versus non-AD individuals with different APOE genotypes. We also investigated plasma total ApoE and ApoE isoform composition in a subset of these individuals. In total n = 43 AD and n = 43 non-AD subjects were included. We found that CSF and plasma total ApoE levels did not correlate with age or cognitive status and did not differ between AD and non-AD subjects deeming ApoE as an unfit diagnostic marker for AD. Also, whereas CSF ApoE levels did not vary between APOE genotypes APOE epsilon4 carriers exhibited significantly decreased plasma ApoE levels attributed to a specific decrease in the ApoE4 isoform concentrations. CSF total ApoE concentrations were positively associated with CSF, total tau, tau phosphorylated at Thr181 and Abeta1-42 of which the latter association was weaker and only present in APOE epsilon4 carriers indicating a differential involvement of ApoE in tau versus Abeta-linked neuropathological processes. Future studies need to elucidate whether the observed plasma ApoE4 deficiency is a life-long condition in APOE e4 carriers and whether this decrease in plasma ApoE predisposes APOE e4 carriers to AD.

24635842|t|Plasma amyloid-beta oligomers and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors as potential biomarkers of AD.
24635842|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta), especially Abeta oligomers, is important in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. AD-associated inflammation has generally been considered as a secondary response to the pathological lesions evoked by Abeta oligomers in the early stage of pathogenesis. We studied the levels of plasma Abeta monomers, Abeta oligomers, and soluble tumor necrosis factor alpha receptors (sTNFRs) in 120 controls, 32 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients, and 90 mild AD patients. The plasma Abeta monomer, oligomer and sTNFR levels were measured by ELISA. We observed that the Abeta oligomer levels in mild AD patients were significantly higher than those in aMCI (200.8+-83.8 versus 93.9+-23.3, P<0.05) and healthy subjects (200.8+-83.8 versus 70.0+-60.9, P<0.05). The sTNFR levels in the plasma of aMCI and mild AD patients were significantly higher than the levels of control subjects. Moreover, the levels of both sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 were significantly correlated with Abeta oligomer levels in aMCI (sTNFR1 : r= 0.376, P= 0.034; sTNFR2 : r= 0.367, P= 0.039) and mild AD patients (sTNFR1 : r= 0.471, P<0.001; sTNFR2 : r= 0.407, P< 0.001). More importantly, changes in Abeta oligomer and sTNFR levels accurately differentiated mild AD patients from control subjects, supporting these levels might be potential diagnostic biomarkers for aMCI and AD.

24636797|t|APP-dependent alteration of GSK3beta activity impairs neurogenesis in the Ts65Dn mouse model of Down syndrome.
24636797|a|Intellectual disability in Down syndrome (DS) appears to be related to severe neurogenesis impairment during brain development. The molecular mechanisms underlying this defect are still largely unknown. Accumulating evidence has highlighted the importance of GSK3beta signaling for neuronal precursor proliferation/differentiation. In neural precursor cells (NPCs) from Ts65Dn mice and human fetuses with DS, we found reduced GSK3beta phosphorylation and, hence, increased GSK3beta activity. In cultures of trisomic subventricular-zone-derived adult NPCs (aNPCs) we found that deregulation of GSK3beta activity was due to higher levels of the AICD fragment of the trisomic gene APP that directly bound to GSK3beta. We restored GSK3beta phosphorylation in trisomic aNPCs using either lithium, a well-known GSK3beta inhibitor, or using a 5-HT receptor agonist or fluoxetine, which activated the serotonin receptor 5-HT1A. Importantly, this effect was accompanied by restoration of proliferation, cell fate specification and neuronal maturation. In agreement with results obtained in vitro, we found that early treatment with fluoxetine, which was previously shown to rescue neurogenesis and behavior in Ts65Dn mice, restored GSK3beta phosphorylation. These results provide a link between GSK3beta activity alteration, APP triplication and the defective neuronal production that characterizes the DS brain. Knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying neurogenesis alterations in DS may help to devise therapeutic strategies, potentially usable in humans. Results suggest that drugs that increase GSK3beta phosphorylation, such as lithium or fluoxetine, may represent useful tools for the improvement of neurogenesis in DS.

24636920|t|Alzheimer amyloid beta inhibition of Eg5/kinesin 5 reduces neurotrophin and/or transmitter receptor function.
24636920|a|The mechanism by which amyloid beta (Abeta) causes neuronal dysfunction and/or death in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is unclear. Previously, we showed that Abeta inhibits several microtubule-dependent kinesin motors essential for mitosis and also present in mature neurons. Here, we show that inhibition of kinesin 5 (Eg5) by Abeta blocks neuronal function by reducing transport of neurotrophin and neurotransmitter receptors to the cell surface. Specifically, cell-surface NGF/NTR(p75) and NMDA receptors decline in cells treated with Abeta or the kinesin 5 inhibitor monastrol, or expressing APP. Abeta and monastrol also inhibit NGF-dependent neurite outgrowth from PC12 cells and glutamate-dependent Ca++ entry into primary neurons. Like Abeta, monastrol inhibits long-term potentiation, a cellular model of NMDA-dependent learning and memory, and kinesin 5 activity is absent from APP/PS transgenic mice brain or neurons treated with Abeta. These data imply that cognitive deficits in AD may derive in part from inhibition of neuronal Eg5 by Abeta, resulting in impaired neuronal function and/or survival through receptor mislocalization. Preventing inhibition of Eg5 or other motors by Abeta may represent a novel approach to AD therapy.

24637300|t|Potential role of antimicrobial peptides in the early onset of Alzheimer's disease.
24637300|a|Cerebral aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) is thought to play a major role in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease. Environmental influences, including chronic bacterial or viral infections, are thought to alter the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and thereby facilitate cerebral colonization by opportunistic pathogens. This may eventually trigger Abeta overproduction and aggregation. Host biomolecules that target and combat these pathogens, for instance, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) such as Abeta itself, are an interesting option for the detection and diagnostic follow-up of such cerebral infections. As part of the innate immune system, AMPs are defensive peptides that efficiently penetrate infected cells and tissues beyond many endothelial barriers, most linings, including the BBB, and overall specifically target pathogens. Based on existing literature, we postulate a role for labeled AMPs as a marker to target pathogens that play a role in the aggregation of amyloid in the brain.

24641999|t|TL-2 attenuates beta-amyloid induced neuronal apoptosis through the AKT/GSK-3beta/beta-catenin pathway.
24641999|a|beta-amyloid (Abeta)-mediated neuronal apoptosis contributes to the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), although the exact mechanism remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether Dalesconol B (TL-2), a potent immunosuppressive agent with an unusual carbon skeleton, could inhibit Abeta-induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo and to explore the underlying mechanisms. Abeta(1-42) was injected to bilateral hippocampus of mice to make the AD models in vivo. TL-2 was able to cross the blood-brain barrier and attenuate memory deficits in the AD mice. TL-2 also inhibited Abeta(1-42)-induced neuronal apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. In addition, TL-2 could activate the AKT/GSK-3beta pathway, and inhibition of AKT and activation of GSK-3beta partially eliminated the neuroprotective effects of TL-2. Furthermore, TL-2 induced the nuclear translocation of beta-catenin and enhanced its transcriptional activity through the AKT/GSK-3beta pathway to promote neuronal survival. These results suggest that TL-2 might be a potential drug for AD treatment.

24642954|t|Quetiapine attenuates recognition memory impairment and hippocampal oxidative stress in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
24642954|a|Quetiapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug, may have beneficial effects in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the effect of quetiapine on object recognition memory in AD has never been measured. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of quetiapine on object recognition memory and on oxidative stress that could be involved in the AD pathogenesis in an amyloid precursor protein/presenilin-1 double transgenic mouse model of AD. Nontransgenic and transgenic mice were treated with quetiapine (0 or 5 mg/kg/day) in drinking water from the age of 2 months. After 10 months of continuous quetiapine administration, object recognition memory impairment and the increased hippocampal protein expression of nitrotyrosine, a protein marker of oxidative stress, were attenuated in the AD mice. These results suggest that quetiapine can attenuate object recognition memory impairment and brain oxidative stress in an amyloid precursor protein/presenilin-1 transgenic mouse model of AD and indicate that the antioxidative effect of early quetiapine intervention may be associated with the beneficial effect of quetiapine on memory in AD.

24643138|a|Passive amyloid-beta (Abeta) vaccination has shown significant effects on amyloid pathology in pre-depositing amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) mice but the results in older mice are inconsistent. A therapeutic effect of LXR and RXR agonists consisting of improved memory deficits and Abeta pathology has been demonstrated in different Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse models. Here, we report the effect of a combination of N-terminal Abeta antibody and synthetic LXR agonist T0901317 (T0) on AD-like phenotype of APP23 mice. To examine the therapeutic potential of this combination, the treatment of mice started at 11 months of age, when amyloid phenotype in this model is fully developed, and continued for 50 days. We show that Abeta immunization with or without LXR agonist restored the performance of APP23 transgenic mice in two behavior paradigms without affecting the existing amyloid plaques. Importantly, we did not observe an increase of brain microhemorrhage which is considered a significant side effect of Abeta vaccination. Target engagement was confirmed by increased Abca1 and ApoE protein level as well as increased ApoE lipidation in soluble brain extract. In interstitial fluid obtained by microdialysis, we demonstrate that immunization and T0 significantly reduced Abeta levels, indicating an increased Abeta clearance. We found no interaction between the immunotherapy and T0, suggesting no synergism, at least with these doses. The results of our study demonstrate that anti-Abeta treatments can ameliorate cognitive deficits in AbetaPP mice with advanced AD-like phenotype in conjunction with a decrease of Abeta in brain interstitium and increase of ApoE lipidation without affecting the existing amyloid plaques.

24643796|t|Endoplasmic reticulum stress promotes amyloid-beta peptides production in RGC-5 cells.
24643796|a|Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. We have previously observed amyloid production in the retina of the Tg2576 transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we used tunicamycin-induced ER stress in RGC-5 cells, a cell line identical to the photoreceptor cell line 661W, to investigate the effect of ER stress on production of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides. We found that the mRNA level of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) remained stable, while the protein level of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) was decreased, the amyloid-beta precursor protein cleaving enzymes beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 and presenilin 1 were upregulated, Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 production were increased, and reactive oxygen species production and apoptosis markers were elevated following induction of ER stress. The protein level of Abeta degradation enzymes, neprilysin, endothelin-converting enzyme 1, and endothelin-converting enzyme 2 remained unchanged during the prolonged ER stress, showing that the generation of Abeta did not result from reduction of proteolysis by these enzymes. Inclusion of group II caspase inhibitor, Z-DEVD-FMK, increased the ER stress mediated Abeta production, suggesting that they are generated by a caspase-independent mechanism. Our findings provided evidence of a role of ER stress in Abeta peptide overproduction and apoptotic pathway activation in RGC-5 cells.

24644038|t|Homocysteine exacerbates beta-amyloid pathology, tau pathology, and cognitive deficit in a mouse model of Alzheimer disease with plaques and tangles.
24644038|a|OBJECTIVE: High level of homocysteine (Hcy) is a recognized risk factor for developing Alzheimer disease (AD). However, the mechanisms involved are unknown. Previously, it was shown that high Hcy increases brain beta-amyloid (Abeta) levels in amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice, but no data are available on the effect that it may have on the other main pathologic features of AD such as tau. METHODS: 3xTg mice with diet-induced high Hcy were compared with mice having normal Hcy. Neuronal cells were incubated with and without Hcy. RESULTS: Diet-induced high Hcy resulted in an exacerbation of the entire AD-like phenotype of the 3xTg mice. In particular, we found that compared with controls, mice with high Hcy developed significant memory and learning deficits, and had elevated Abeta levels and deposition, which was mediated by an activation of the gamma-secretase pathway. In addition, the same mice had a significant increase in the insoluble fraction of tau and its phosphorylation at specific epitopes, which was mediated by the cdk5 pathway. In vitro studies confirmed these observations and provided evidence that the effects of Hcy on Abeta and tau are independent from each other. INTERPRETATION: Taken together, our findings demonstrate that a dietary condition that leads to an elevation of Hcy levels results in an exacerbation of all 3 major pathological features of the AD phenotype: memory deficits, and Abeta and tau neuropathology. They support the concept that this dietary lifestyle can act as a risk factor and actively contribute to the development of the disease.

24646516|t|Diurnal patterns of soluble amyloid precursor protein metabolites in the human central nervous system.
24646516|a|The amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein is diurnally regulated in both the cerebrospinal fluid and blood in healthy adults; circadian amplitudes decrease with aging and the presence of cerebral Abeta deposits. The cause of the Abeta diurnal pattern is poorly understood. One hypothesis is that the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) is diurnally regulated, leading to APP product diurnal patterns. APP in the central nervous system is processed either via the beta-pathway (amyloidogenic), generating soluble APP-beta (sAPPbeta) and Abeta, or the alpha-pathway (non-amyloidogenic), releasing soluble APP-alpha (sAPPalpha). To elucidate the potential contributions of APP to the Abeta diurnal pattern and the balance of the alpha- and beta- pathways in APP processing, we measured APP proteolytic products over 36 hours in human cerebrospinal fluid from cognitively normal and Alzheimer's disease participants. We found diurnal patterns in sAPPalpha, sAPPbeta, Abeta40, and Abeta42, which diminish with increased age, that support the hypothesis that APP is diurnally regulated in the human central nervous system and thus results in Abeta diurnal patterns. We also found that the four APP metabolites were positively correlated in all participants without cerebral Abeta deposits. This positive correlation suggests that the alpha- and beta- APP pathways are non-competitive under normal physiologic conditions where APP availability may be the limiting factor that determines sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta production. However, in participants with cerebral Abeta deposits, there was no correlation of Abeta to sAPP metabolites, suggesting that normal physiologic regulation of cerebrospinal fluid Abeta is impaired in the presence of amyloidosis. Lastly, we found that the ratio of sAPPbeta to sAPPalpha was significantly higher in participants with cerebral Abeta deposits versus those without deposits. Therefore, the sAPPbeta to sAPPalpha ratio may be a useful biomarker for cerebral amyloidosis.

24646641|t|Varenicline-assisted smoking cessation decreases oxidative stress and restores endothelial function.
24646641|a|Smoking cessation decreases oxidative stress and restores vascular endothelial function. However, a recent meta-analysis suggests that the use of varenicline, a alpha4beta2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist, increases the risk of cardiovascular events. This study was designed to determine the effect of varenicline-assisted smoking cessation on vascular endothelial function. Study subjects were 11 healthy Japanese males (mean age, 54.4 years) without evidence of cardiovascular disease who were eager to quit smoking. Each subject was treated with varenicline titrated up to 1.0 mg twice daily. We evaluated serum derivatives of reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROMs) as a marker of oxidative stress, and flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery as a marker of vascular endothelial function. Both measurements were performed before and 3 months after completing smoking cessation. All subjects gained weight (average, 1.7 kg) after smoking cessation. However, there were no significant differences in the following parameters before and after smoking cessation: systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, glucose and hemoglobin A1c. Serum d-ROM levels significantly decreased from 340.7+-70.4 to 300.0+-43.2 U.CARR (P=0.012), and FMD significantly increased from 3.36+-1.26 to 5.25+-1.33% (P=0.00067) after smoking cessation. There was an inverse correlation between FMD and serum d-ROM levels (R=-0.377; P=0.043). Our observations suggest that varenicline-assisted smoking cessation restores vascular endothelial function, and this is associated with decreased oxidative stress, despite an increase in body weight. As varenicline-assisted smoking cessation possibly has beneficial effects on vascular endothelial function, it might also reduce cardiovascular risk.

24647577|t|Amyloid PET imaging in Alzheimer's disease: a comparison of three radiotracers.
24647577|a|PURPOSE: The increasing use of amyloid PET in Alzheimer's disease research and clinical trials has motivated efforts to standardize methodology. We compared retention of the (11)C radiotracer Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) and that of two (18)F amyloid radiotracers (florbetapir and flutemetamol) using two study populations. We also examined the feasibility of converting between tracer-specific measures, using PiB as the common link between the two (18)F tracers. METHODS: One group of 40 subjects underwent PiB and flutemetamol imaging sessions and a separate group of 32 subjects underwent PiB and florbetapir imaging sessions. We compared cortical and white matter retention for each (18)F tracer relative to that of PiB, as well as retention in several reference regions and image analysis methods. Correlations between tracer pairs were used to convert tracer-specific threshold values for amyloid positivity between tracers. RESULTS: Cortical retention for each pair of tracers was strongly correlated regardless of reference region (PiB-flutemetamol, rho = 0.84-0.99; PiB-florbetapir, rho = 0.83-0.97) and analysis method (rho = 0.90-0.99). Compared to PiB, flutemetamol had higher white matter retention, while florbetapir had lower cortical retention. Two previously established independent thresholds for amyloid positivity were highly consistent when values were converted between tracer pairs. CONCLUSION: Despite differing white and grey matter retention characteristics, cortical retention for each (18)F tracer was highly correlated with that of PiB, enabling conversion of thresholds across tracer measurement scales with a high level of internal consistency. Standardization of analysis methods and measurement scales may facilitate the comparison of amyloid PET data obtained using different tracers.

24650257|t|beta-Amyloid and neprilysin computational studies identify critical residues implicated in binding specificity.
24650257|a|The zinc metalloprotease neprilysin (NEP) promiscuously degrades small bioactive peptides. NEP is among a select group of metalloenzymes that degrade the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) in vivo and in situ. Since accumulation of neurotoxic Abeta aggregates in the brain appears to be a causative agent in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), increased clearance of Abeta resulting from overexpression of NEP exhibits therapeutic potential for AD. However, higher NEP peptidase activity may be harmful without an increased specificity for Abeta over other competing substrates. Crystal structures of NEP-inhibitor complexes and their characterization have highlighted potential amino acid interactions involved in substrate binding and are used as templates to guide our methodology in docking Abeta in NEP. Results from protein-ligand docking calculations predict S2' subsite residues Arg 102 and Arg 110 of NEP participate in specific interactions with Abeta. These interactions provide insight into developing NEP specificity for Abeta.

24654702|t|Chemical engineering of self-assembled Alzheimer's peptide on a silanized silicon surface.
24654702|a|The aim of this work is to develop a sensitive and specific immune-sensing platform dedicated to the detection of potential biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in biological fluids. Accordingly, a controlled and adaptive surface functionalization of a silicon wafer with 7-octenyltrichlorosilane has been performed. The surface has extensively been characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM; morphology) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; chemical composition) and contact angle measurements. The wettability of the grafted chemical groups demonstrated the gradual trend from hydrophilic to hydrophobic surface during functionalization. XPS evidenced the presence of silanes on the surface after silanization, and even carboxylic groups as products from the oxidation step of the functionalization process. The characterization results permitted us to define an optimal protocol to reach a high-quality grafting yield. The issue of the quality of controlled chemical preparation on bioreceiving surfaces was also investigated by the recognition of one AD biomarker, the amyloid peptide Abeta 1-42. We have therefore evaluated the biological activity of the grafted anti Abeta antibodies onto this silanized surface by fluorescent microscopy. In conclusion, we have shown, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the uniformity of the optimized functionalization on slightly oxidized silicon surfaces, providing a reliable and chemically stable procedure to determine specific biomarkers of Alzheimer disease. This work opens the route to the integration of controlled immune-sensing applications on lab-on-chip systems.

24655507|t|Side-chain to main-chain hydrogen bonding controls the intrinsic backbone dynamics of the amyloid precursor protein transmembrane helix.
24655507|a|Many transmembrane helices contain serine and/or threonine residues whose side chains form intrahelical H-bonds with upstream carbonyl oxygens. Here, we investigated the impact of threonine side-chain/main-chain backbonding on the backbone dynamics of the amyloid precursor protein transmembrane helix. This helix consists of a N-terminal dimerization region and a C-terminal cleavage region, which is processed by gamma-secretase to a series of products. Threonine mutations within this transmembrane helix are known to alter the cleavage pattern, which can lead to early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Circular dichroism spectroscopy and amide exchange experiments of synthetic transmembrane domain peptides reveal that mutating threonine enhances the flexibility of this helix. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the mutations reduce intrahelical amide H-bonding and H-bond lifetimes. In addition, the removal of side-chain/main-chain backbonding distorts the helix, which alters bending and rotation at a diglycine hinge connecting the dimerization and cleavage regions. We propose that the backbone dynamics of the substrate profoundly affects the way by which the substrate is presented to the catalytic site within the enzyme. Changing this conformational flexibility may thus change the pattern of proteolytic processing.

24656258|t|Intrinsic connectivity identifies the hippocampus as a main crossroad between Alzheimer's and semantic dementia-targeted networks.
24656258|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and semantic dementia (SD) are both characterized by severe atrophy in the hippocampus, a brain region underlying episodic memory; paradoxically, episodic memory is relatively preserved in SD. Here, we used intrinsic connectivity analyses and showed that the brain networks differentially vulnerable to each disease converge to the hippocampus in the healthy brain. As neurodegeneration is thought to spread within preexisting networks, the common hippocampal atrophy in both diseases is likely due to its location at the crossroad between both vulnerable networks. Yet, we showed that in the normal brain, these networks harbor different functions, with episodic memory relying on the AD-vulnerable network only. Overall, disease-associated cognitive deficits seem to reflect the disruption of targeted networks more than atrophy in specific brain regions: in AD, over hippocampal atrophy, episodic memory deficits are likely due to disconnection within a memory-related network.

24656814|t|Detection of misfolded Abeta oligomers for sensitive biochemical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
24656814|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis is hampered by the lack of early, sensitive, and objective laboratory tests. We describe a sensitive method for biochemical diagnosis of AD based on specific detection of misfolded Abeta oligomers, which play a central role in AD pathogenesis. The protein misfolding cyclic amplification assay (Abeta-PMCA), exploits the functional property of Abeta oligomers to seed the polymerization of monomeric Abeta. Abeta-PMCA allowed detection of as little as 3 fmol of Abeta oligomers. Most importantly, using cerebrospinal fluid, we were able to distinguish AD patients from control individuals affected by a variety of other neurodegenerative disorders or nondegenerative neurological diseases with overall sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 92%. These findings provide the proof-of-principle basis for developing a highly sensitive and specific biochemical test for AD diagnosis.

24661139|t|Gastrodin alleviates memory deficits and reduces neuropathology in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
24661139|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease, characterized by excessive accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and activation of microglia cells and astrocytes. In this research, we evaluated whether gastrodin, an active component isolated from the rhizome of Gastrodia elata, has neuroprotective effects in a mouse model of AD, Tg2576 mice. Treatment of gastrodin (60 mg/kg for 15 days) significantly improved memory impairments in the Morris water maze test and probe test. Moreover, immunohistochemical and ELISA results indicated that gastrodin significantly attenuated Abeta deposition and glial activation in brains of these transgenic mice. These findings suggested that gastrodin exerted neuroprotective activity via anti-inflammatory and anti-amyloidogenic effects and that gastrodin may be a potential option for AD therapy.

24661180|t|Reversal of aggregation using beta-breaker dipeptide containing peptides: Application to Abeta(1-40) self-assembly and its inhibition.
24661180|a|Reversion of protein or peptide aggregation is a formidable task, important in various domains of research at the interface of chemistry, medicine, and nanoscience. A novel class of dipeptides, termed as beta-breaker dipeptides (BBDPs), is identified, which can be incorporated into the self-recognizing sequences to generate a novel class of conformational switch which forms beta-sheet at an initial stage and then converts in a controlled manner to random coil at specific conditions. Incorporation of BBDPs in a well designed amyloidogenic peptides generates a special class of beta-sheet breaker peptides those undergo a chemical change at physiological condition generating a breaker element in situ. These beta-breaker peptides are shown to first incorporate into the amyloid and then disrupt it. Such conformational switches may be used to study agrregation/disaggregation process and may find many biomedical applications relevant to aggregation related disorders. Such strategy for reversion of peptide aggregation using chemical tricks may find application in material chemistry as well.

24661684|t|Single-center experience with extracorporeal photopheresis in pediatric heart transplantation.
24661684|a|BACKGROUND: The pediatric heart transplant literature contains little information regarding extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP), despite International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation guidelines recommending it for recurrent/recalcitrant rejection. We report our experience with ECP in pediatric heart transplantation. METHODS: Data were obtained on heart transplant patients who were aged <= 18 years at the time of transplantation and received ECP between 1990 and 2012 at our institution. RESULTS: Twenty heart transplant patients underwent 22 courses of ECP. Median ages were 12.7 years (range, 0.3-18.5 years) at transplant and 15.3 years (range, 7.3-31 years) at initial ECP. Median time from transplant to ECP was 1.4 years (range, 0.1-12.6 years). The median ECP duration was 5.8 months (range, 1.9-16.1 months). Indications for ECP included rejection with hemodynamic compromise (HC) in 4 patients, rejection without HC in 12, and prophylaxis in 2. Eleven patients died at a median time of 3.1 years after the start of ECP. Survival after ECP was 84% at 1 year and 53% at 3 years. Eleven patients were considered non-compliant and had a trend toward lower survival of 75% at 1 year and 18% at 3 years (p = 0.06 compared with compliant patients). One patient developed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia during ECP and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease 21 months after finishing ECP. No other adverse effects or infectious complications associated with ECP were noted. CONCLUSIONS: This case series represents the largest reported experience with ECP in pediatric heart transplantation. ECP can be safely applied in this patient group. Despite EPC, non-compliant patients showed a trend toward lower survival than compliant patients.

24662009|t|Effect of whole-body periodic acceleration on exercise-induced muscle damage after eccentric exercise.
24662009|a|PURPOSE: To examine the effects of whole-body periodic acceleration (pGz) on exercise-induced-muscle-damage (EIMD) -related symptoms induced by unaccustomed eccentric arm exercise. METHODS: Seventeen active young men (23.4 +- 4.6 y) made 6 visits to the research facility over a 2-wk period. On day 1, subjects performed a 1-repetition-maximum (1RM) elbow-flexion test and were randomly assigned to the pGz (n = 8) or control group (n = 9). Criterion measurements were taken on day 2, before and immediately after performance of the eccentric-exercise protocol (10 sets, 10 repetitions using 120% 1RM) and after the recovery period. During subsequent sessions (24, 48, 72, and 96 h) these data were collected before pGz or passive recovery. Measurements included isometric strength (maximal voluntary contraction [MVC]), blood markers (creatine kinase, myoglobin, IL-6, TNF-alpha, TBARS, PGF2alpha, protein carbonyls, uric acid, and nitrites), soreness, pain, circumference, and range of motion (ROM). RESULTS: Significantly higher MVC values were seen for pGz throughout the recovery period. Within-group differences were seen in myoglobin, IL-6, IL-10, protein carbonyls, soreness, pain, circumference, and ROM showing small negative responses and rapid recovery for the pGz condition. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that pGz can be an effective tool for the reduction of EIMD and may contribute to the training-adaptation cycle by speeding up the recovery of the body due to its performance-loss-lessening effect.

24662099|t|Pharmacological modulation of GSAP reduces amyloid-beta levels and tau phosphorylation in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease with plaques and tangles.
24662099|a|Accumulation of neurotoxic amyloid-beta (Abeta) is a major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and an important player in its clinical manifestations. Formation of Abeta is controlled by the availability of an enzyme called gamma-secretase. Despite its blockers being attractive therapeutic tools for lowering Abeta, this approach has failed because of their serious toxic side-effects. The discovery of the gamma-secretase activating protein (GSAP), a co-factor for this protease which facilitates Abeta production without affecting other pathways responsible for the toxicity, is giving us the opportunity to develop a safer anti-Abeta therapy. In this study we have characterized the effect of Imatinib, an inhibitor of GSAP, in the 3xTg mice, a mouse model of AD with plaques and tangles. Compared with controls, mice receiving the drug had a significant reduction in brain Abeta levels and deposition, but no changes in the steady state levels of AbetaPP, BACE-1, ADAM-10, or the four components of the gamma-secretase complex. By contrast, Imatinib-treated animals had a significant increase in CTF-beta and a significant reduction in GSAP expression levels. Additionally, we observed that tau phosphorylation was reduced at specific epitopes together with its insoluble fraction. In vitro studies confirmed that Imatinib prevents Abeta formation by modulating gamma-secretase activity and GSAP levels. Our findings represent the first in vivo demonstration of the biological role that GSAP plays in the development of the AD-like neuropathologies. They establish this protein as a viable target for a safer anti-Abeta therapeutic approach in AD.

24664800|a|Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a hematopoietic cytokine that also possesses neurotrophic and antiapoptotic properties. G-CSF has been reported to decrease amyloid burden significantly, promote hippocampal neurogenesis, and improve spatial learning in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. To understand better the effects of G-CSF on hippocampal-dependent learning, the present study focused on electrophysiological correlates of neuroplasticity, long-term potentiation (LTP), and long-term depression (LTD). Two cohorts of transgenic APP/PS1 mice, with or without prior bone marrow transplantation from Tg GFP mice, were treated in vivo for 2 weeks with G-CSF or vehicle. After completion of the treatments, hippocampal slices were prepared for electrophysiological studies of LTP and LTD. LTP was induced and maintained in both G-CSF-treated and vehicle-treated groups of Tg APP/PS1. In contrast, LTD could not be induced in vehicle-treated Tg APP/PS1 mice, but G-CSF treatment restored LTD. The LTP and LTD results obtained from the cohort of bone marrow-grafted Tg APP/PS1 mice did not differ from those from nongrafted Tg APP/PS1 mice. The mechanism by which G-CSF restores LTD is not known, but it is possible that its capacity to reduce amyloid plaques results in increased soluble oligomers of amyloid-beta (A-beta), which in turn may facilitate LTD. This mechanism would be consistent with the recent report that soluble A-beta oligomers promote LTD in hippocampal slices.

24669800|t|X-ray crystallographic structures of trimers and higher-order oligomeric assemblies of a peptide derived from Abeta(17-36).
24669800|a|A peptide derived from Abeta17-36 crystallizes to form trimers that further associate to form higher-order oligomers. The trimers consist of three highly twisted beta-hairpins in a triangular arrangement. Two trimers associate face-to-face in the crystal lattice to form a hexamer; four trimers in a tetrahedral arrangement about a central cavity form a dodecamer. These structures provide a working model for the structures of oligomers associated with neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease.

24669873|t|Interaction between prion protein and Abeta amyloid fibrils revisited.
24669873|a|Recent studies indicate that the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease may be related to the interaction between prion protein (PrP) and certain oligomeric species of Abeta peptide. However, the mechanism of this interaction remains unclear and controversial. Here we provide direct experimental evidence that, in addition to previously demonstrated binding to Abeta oligomers, PrP also interacts with mature Abeta fibrils. However, contrary to the recent claim that PrP causes fragmentation of Abeta fibrils into oligomeric species, no evidence for such a disassembly could be detected in the present study. In contrast, our data indicate that the addition of PrP to preformed Abeta fibrils results in a lateral association of individual fibrils into larger bundles. These findings have potentially important implications for understanding the mechanism by which PrP might impact Abeta toxicity as well as for the emerging efforts to use PrP-derived compounds as inhibitors of Abeta-induced neurodegeneration.

24671229|t|Metal complexes designed to bind to amyloid-beta for the diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
24671229|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of age-related neurodegenerative dementia. The disease is characterised by the presence of plaques in the cerebral cortex. The major constituent of these plaques is aggregated amyloid-beta peptide. This review focuses on the molecular aspects of metal complexes designed to bind to amyloid-beta. The development of radioactive metal-based complexes of copper and technetium designed as diagnostic imaging agents to detect amyloid burden in the brain is discussed. Separate sections of the review discuss the use of luminescent metal complexes to act as non-conventional probes of amyloid formation and recent research into the use of metal complexes as inhibitors of amyloid formation and toxicity.

24671940|t|Ferrous iron formation following the co-aggregation of ferric iron and the Alzheimer's disease peptide beta-amyloid (1-42).
24671940|a|For decades, a link between increased levels of iron and areas of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology has been recognized, including AD lesions comprised of the peptide beta-amyloid (Abeta). Despite many observations of this association, the relationship between Abeta and iron is poorly understood. Using X-ray microspectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, electron microscopy and spectrophotometric iron(II) quantification techniques, we examine the interaction between Abeta(1-42) and synthetic iron(III), reminiscent of ferric iron stores in the brain. We report Abeta to be capable of accumulating iron(III) within amyloid aggregates, with this process resulting in Abeta-mediated reduction of iron(III) to a redox-active iron(II) phase. Additionally, we show that the presence of aluminium increases the reductive capacity of Abeta, enabling the redox cycling of the iron. These results demonstrate the ability of Abeta to accumulate iron, offering an explanation for previously observed local increases in iron concentration associated with AD lesions. Furthermore, the ability of iron to form redox-active iron phases from ferric precursors provides an origin both for the redox-active iron previously witnessed in AD tissue, and the increased levels of oxidative stress characteristic of AD. These interactions between Abeta and iron deliver valuable insights into the process of AD progression, which may ultimately provide targets for disease therapies.

24673484|t|Enhancement of binding affinity for amyloid aggregates by multivalent interactions of 99mTc-hydroxamamide complexes.
24673484|a|Deposition of amyloid aggregates has been regarded as an early stage of amyloidosis progression. An imaging probe that can image amyloid aggregates enables the early diagnosis of amyloidosis and contributes to the development of new medical therapies. High binding affinity for amyloid aggregates is essential to develop a useful molecular imaging probe. This article describes a new strategy to enhance the binding affinity of imaging agents targeting amyloid aggregates. We designed and synthesized novel (99m)Tc-hydroxamamide ((99m)Tc-Ham) complexes with a bivalent amyloid ligand and evaluated their binding affinity for amyloid aggregates by using beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta(1-42)) aggregates as a model. In vitro inhibition assay indicated that bivalent (99m)Tc-Ham complexes had much higher binding affinity for amyloid aggregates than monovalent complexes. In vitro autoradiography using Tg2576 mice showed the specific binding of bivalent (99m)Tc-Ham complexes to Abeta plaques in the mouse brain, as reflected in the results of the inhibition assay. The preliminary results suggest that a new molecular design based on bivalent (99m)Tc-Ham complexes may be reasonable to develop an imaging probe targeting amyloid aggregates.

24676028|a|We examined the distribution of zinc in the periphery (erythrocytes and serum) in a large, well-characterised cohort, the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study, in order to determine if there is systemic perturbation in zinc homeostasis in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We observed an age dependent decrease in serum zinc of approximately 0.4% per year. When correcting for the age dependent decline in serum zinc no significant difference between healthy controls (HC), mildly cognitively impaired (MCI) or AD subjects was observed.

24677221|t|Appearance of Subchondral Bone in Computed Tomography Is Related to Cartilage Damage in Osteochondral Lesions of the Talar Dome.
24677221|a|BACKGROUND: Osteochondral lesions of the talar dome (OLT) involve the articular cartilage and/or subchondral bone. The subchondral bone plate plays an important role in cartilage metabolism. We hypothesized that the findings of subchondral bone on CT image would be related to the cartilage damage of OLT. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the arthroscopic and CT findings focused on subchondral bone. METHODS: Thirty-one ankles diagnosed as OLT were analyzed. All patients underwent CT, MRI, and arthroscopic surgery. The CT findings for both the cystic and fragment lesions were classified into 3 types. The 3 types for the cystic lesion ankles were irregular shape, round shape with sclerotic wall, and irregular shape with opening to an articular cavity. The 3 types for the fragment lesion were no bone absorption, bed absorption without fragment absorption, and bed sclerosis and fragment absorption. The subchondral bone findings on CT were compared with International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) grades and arthroscopic grading. RESULTS: All round and sclerotic cystic lesions revealed cartilaginous flap lesions with a nearly normal cartilage surface. An irregular shape with opening revealed an unstable lesion with severely damaged cartilage. As for fragment lesions, no absorption revealed a stable lesion with a nearly normal cartilage surface. Bed absorption revealed an unstable lesion with a nearly normal cartilage surface. Fragment absorption with bed sclerosis showed an unstable lesion with severely damaged cartilage. There was a significant difference between CT findings and ICRS grade or arthroscopic findings (both P < .01), while there was no significant difference with MRI grading. The diagnosis of cartilage status by CT was better than MRI. CONCLUSION: CT findings for OLT based on subchondral bone related to cartilage damage. This study showed that CT was a useful tool for evaluating cartilage damage in OLT. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, comparative case series.

24678630|t|A critical review of traditional Chinese medicine use amongst women with menopausal symptoms.
24678630|a|OBJECTIVES: To provide the first critical review of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) use amongst symptomatic menopausal women, drawing upon work examining the perspectives of both TCM users and TCM practitioners. METHODS: A search was conducted in three English-language databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL and AMED) and three Chinese-language databases (CNKI, VIP and CBM Disc) for 2002-2013 international peer-reviewed articles reporting empirical findings of TCM use in menopause. RESULTS: A total of 25 journal articles reporting 22 studies were identified as meeting the review inclusion criteria. Chinese herbal medicine appears to be the most common therapy amongst symptomatic menopausal women, and vasomotor symptoms and emotional changes are the most frequent symptoms for which TCM is sought. However, evidence regarding the prevalence of TCM use and users' profile in menopause is limited. Existing studies are of varied methodological quality, often reporting low response rate, extensive recall bias and a lack of syndrome differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides insights for practitioners and health policy-makers regarding TCM care to symptomatic menopausal women. More nationally representative studies are required to rigorously examine TCM use for the management of menopausal symptoms. Syndrome differentiation of menopausal women is an area which also warrants further attention.

24678659|t|In vivo imaging reveals sigmoidal growth kinetic of beta-amyloid plaques.
24678659|a|A major neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease is the deposition of amyloid plaques in the brains of affected individuals. Amyloid plaques mainly consist of fibrillar beta-amyloid, which is a cleavage product of the amyloid precursor protein. The amyloid-cascade-hypothesis postulates Abeta accumulation as the central event in initiating a toxic cascade leading to Alzheimer's disease pathology and, ultimately, loss of cognitive function. We studied the kinetics of beta-amyloid deposition in Tg2576 mice, which overexpress human amyloid precursor protein with the Swedish mutation. Utilizing long-term two-photon imaging we were able to observe the entire kinetics of plaque growth in vivo. Essentially, we observed that plaque growth follows a sigmoid-shaped curve comprising a cubic growth phase, followed by saturation. In contrast, plaque density kinetics exhibited an asymptotic progression. Taking into account the fact that a critical concentration of Abeta is required to seed new plaques, we can propose the following kinetic model of beta-amyloid deposition in vivo. In the early cubic phase, plaque growth is not limited by Abeta concentration and plaque density increases very fast. During the transition phase, plaque density stabilizes whereas plaque volume increases strongly reflecting a robust growth of the plaques. In the late asymptotic phase, Abeta peptide production becomes rate-limiting for plaque growth. In conclusion, the present study offers a direct link between in vitro and in vivo studies facilitating the translation of Abeta-lowering strategies from laboratory models to patients.

24678962|t|NAD attenuates oxidative DNA damages induced by amyloid beta-peptide in primary rat cortical neurons.
24678962|a|One major pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is accumulation of senile plaques in patients' brains, mainly composed of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta). Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) has emerged as a common mediator regulating energy metabolism, mitochondrial function, aging, and cell death, all of which are critically involved in neuronal demise observed in AD. In this work, we tested the hypothesis that NAD may attenuate Abeta-induced DNA damages, thereby conferring neuronal resistance to primary rat cortical cultures. We found that co-incubation of NAD dose-dependently attenuated neurotoxicity mediated by Abeta25-35 and Abeta1-42 in cultured rat cortical neurons, with the optimal protective dosage at 50 mM. NAD also abolished the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by Abeta25-35. Furthermore, Abetas were capable of inducing oxidative DNA damages by increasing the extents of 8-hydroxy-2 -deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG), numbers of apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites, genomic DNA single-stranded breaks (SSBs), as well as DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs)/fragmentation, which can all be attenuated upon co-incubation with NAD. Our results thus reveal a novel finding that NAD is protective against DNA damage induced by existing Abeta, leading ultimately to neuroprotection in primary cortical culture.

24681664|t|Non-invasive assessment of Alzheimer's disease neurofibrillary pathology using 18F-THK5105 PET.
24681664|a|Non-invasive imaging of tau pathology in the living brain would be useful for accurately diagnosing Alzheimer's disease, tracking disease progression, and evaluating the treatment efficacy of disease-specific therapeutics. In this study, we evaluated the clinical usefulness of a novel tau-imaging positron emission tomography tracer 18F-THK5105 in 16 human subjects including eight patients with Alzheimer's disease (three male and five females, 66-82 years) and eight healthy elderly controls (three male and five females, 63-76 years). All participants underwent neuropsychological examination and 3D magnetic resonance imaging, as well as both 18F-THK5105 and 11C-Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography scans. Standard uptake value ratios at 90-100 min and 40-70 min post-injection were calculated for 18F-THK5105 and 11C-Pittsburgh compound B, respectively, using the cerebellar cortex as the reference region. As a result, significantly higher 18F-THK5105 retention was observed in the temporal, parietal, posterior cingulate, frontal and mesial temporal cortices of patients with Alzheimer's disease compared with healthy control subjects. In patients with Alzheimer's disease, the inferior temporal cortex, which is an area known to contain high densities of neurofibrillary tangles in the Alzheimer's disease brain, showed prominent 18F-THK5105 retention. Compared with high frequency (100%) of 18F-THK5105 retention in the temporal cortex of patients with Alzheimer's disease, frontal 18F-THK5105 retention was less frequent (37.5%) and was only observed in cases with moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, 11C-Pittsburgh compound B retention was highest in the posterior cingulate cortex, followed by the ventrolateral prefrontal, anterior cingulate, and superior temporal cortices, and did not correlate with 18F-THK5105 retention in the neocortex. In healthy control subjects, 18F-THK5105 retention was ~10% higher in the mesial temporal cortex than in the neocortex. Notably, unlike 11C-Pittsburgh compound B, 18F-THK5105 retention was significantly correlated with cognitive parameters, hippocampal and whole brain grey matter volumes, which was consistent with findings from previous post-mortem studies showing significant correlations of neurofibrillary tangle density with dementia severity or neuronal loss. From these results, 18F-THK5105 positron emission tomography is considered to be useful for the non-invasive assessment of tau pathology in the living brain. This technique would be applicable to the longitudinal evaluation of tau deposition and allow a better understanding of the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease.

24682752|t|Sphingosine kinase-1 protects differentiated N2a cells against beta-amyloid25-35-induced neurotoxicity via the mitochondrial pathway.
24682752|a|Although the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not fully understood, multiple lines of evidence suggests the importance of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the initiation/progression of the disease. Abeta has been shown to induce neuronal apoptosis via the sphingomyelin/ceramide pathway. This study was designed to elucidate whether the sphingosine kinase-1 (SPK1), a critical regulator of the ceramide/sphingosine 1-phosphate rheostat, plays a pivotal role in the regulation of death and survival of differentiated neuro-2a cells in response to beta-amyloid peptide fragment 25-35 (Abeta25-35). These results show that the expression of SPK1 was markedly decreased in Abeta25-35-induced neurotoxicity, as evidenced by the decreased cell viability and the increased apoptotic rate. Overexpression of SPK1 significantly attenuated Abeta25-35-induced neurotoxicity, whereas silencing the expression of SPK1 exacerbated it. Moreover, overexpression of SPK1 can significantly attenuate Abeta25-35-induced upregulation of Bax and rehabilitate the level of Bcl-2; concomitantly, it can ameliorate mitochondrial ultrastructure. These studies demonstrate that overexpression of SPK1 may moderate Abeta25-35-induced neurotoxicity by regulating the Bcl-2/Bax ratio and improving mitochondrial ultrastructure. Based on these findings, SPK1 is a potential therapeutic target for AD.

24682783|t|The chaperone domain BRICHOS prevents CNS toxicity of amyloid-beta peptide in Drosophila melanogaster.
24682783|a|Aggregation of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) into toxic oligomers and amyloid fibrils is linked to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mutations of the BRICHOS chaperone domain are associated with amyloid disease and recent in vitro data show that BRICHOS efficiently delays Abeta42 oligomerization and fibril formation. We have generated transgenic Drosophila melanogaster flies that express the Abeta42 peptide and the BRICHOS domain in the central nervous system (CNS). Co-expression of Abeta42 and BRICHOS resulted in delayed Abeta42 aggregation and dramatic improvements of both lifespan and locomotor function compared with flies expressing Abeta42 alone. Moreover, BRICHOS increased the ratio of soluble:insoluble Abeta42 and bound to deposits of Abeta42 in the fly brain. Our results show that the BRICHOS domain efficiently reduces the neurotoxic effects of Abeta42, although significant Abeta42 aggregation is taking place. We propose that BRICHOS-based approaches should be explored with an aim towards the future prevention and treatment of AD.

24682919|t|Evaluation of selenium, redox status and their association with plasma amyloid/tau in Alzheimer's disease.
24682919|a|The aim of the study was to evaluate blood selenium and antioxidants as possible oxidative stress markers in Alzheimer's disease (AD) along with amyloid beta42 (Abeta42) and tau by comparing them with vascular dementia (VD) and age-matched healthy controls. Selenium, total tau, Abeta42, glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and the activities of antioxidant enzymes were analysed in the blood of AD patients (n = 30), VD patients (n = 35) and controls (n = 40) from South India. Plasma Abeta42 level was significantly higher (P < 0.001) in both AD and VD compared to controls. Total tau and tau-to-amyloid ratio were significantly lower in both AD and VD (P < 0.001), compared to controls, and a significant difference (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively) was also observed between AD and VD. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve-derived cutoff values of <3.5 for tau-to-Abeta42 ratio and <520 pg/ml for total tau showed sensitivity and specificity of around 67-72 % for differentiating AD from VD and around 90 % for AD from controls, indicating that they could serve as reliable AD-specific markers. The MDA levels were significantly higher (P < 0.001) in both dementia groups along with a significant decrease (P < 0.001) in reduced GSH levels, indicating elevated oxidative stress and altered redox status in both forms of dementia. Selenium levels did not vary significantly between the three groups. The activity of glutathione peroxidase increased in both AD and VD compared to controls, with a concomitant decrease in glutathione reductase and glucose-6-phospate dehydrogenase (P < 0.001) activity. The activity of thioredoxin reductase was significantly lower in both patient groups (P < 0.001) compared to healthy controls. No correlation was observed between selenium and activities of selenoenzymes, tau, Abeta42 or tau-to-Abeta42 ratio, when analysing independently, indicating that blood selenium may not be directly involved in Abeta production and in regulating tau/Abeta42-mediated mechanism in AD. The present study emphasizes the enhanced oxidative stress in AD pathology and plasma tau and tau-to-amyloid ratio as possible markers to differentiate AD from VD. The study also points that blood selenium may not be involved in regulating oxidative stress in AD, and a longitudinal study correlating plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) selenium and selenoprotein levels is warranted.

24684630|t|Impairments of long-term depression induction and motor coordination precede Abeta accumulation in the cerebellum of APPswe/PS1dE9 double transgenic mice.
24684630|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that represents the most common type of dementia among elderly people. Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides in extracellular Abeta plaques, produced from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) via sequential processing by beta- and gamma-secretases, impair hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and cause cognitive dysfunction in AD patients. Here, we report that Abeta peptides also impair another form of synaptic plasticity; cerebellar long-term depression (LTD). In the cerebellum of commonly used AD mouse model, APPswe/PS1dE9 mice, Abeta plaques were detected from 8 months and profound accumulation of Abeta plaques was observed at 18 onths of age. Biochemical analysis revealed relatively high levels of APP protein and Abeta in the cerebellum of APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. At pre-Abeta accumulation stage, LTD induction, and motor coordination are disturbed. These results indicate that soluble Abeta oligomers disturb LTD induction and cerebellar function in AD mouse model.

24684788|t|Hippocampal subfield volumes at 7T in early Alzheimer's disease and normal aging.
24684788|a|We compared hippocampal subfield and entorhinal cortex (ERC) volumes between patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and controls without cognitive impairment. Additionally, we investigated the relation between age and hippocampal subfields and ERC in controls. We performed ultra-high field 0.7 mm(3) 7Tesla magnetic resonance imaging in 16 patients with amnestic MCI, 9 with AD, and 29 controls. ERC, subiculum, cornu ammonis (CA)1, CA2, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG)&CA4 were traced on T2-weighted images. Analyses of covariance, adjusted for age, sex, and intracranial volume showed that compared with controls and patients with MCI, patients with AD had significantly smaller ERC, subiculum, CA1, CA3, and DG&CA4 volumes. Trend analyses revealed similar associations between ERC and hippocampal subfields and diagnostic group. Older age was significantly associated with smaller CA1 and DG&CA4 volumes. In conclusion, almost all hippocampal subfields and ERC show volume reductions in patients with AD compared with controls and patients with MCI. Future, larger studies should determine which subfields are affected earliest in the disease process and what mechanisms underlie the volume loss.

24684789|t|Reverse engineering of Alzheimer's disease based on biomarker pathways analysis.
24684789|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses an increasingly profound problem to society, yet progress toward a genuine understanding of the disease remains worryingly slow. Perhaps, the most outstanding problem with the biology of AD is the question of its mechanistic origins, that is, it remains unclear wherein the molecular failures occur that underlie the disease. We demonstrate how molecular biomarkers could help define the nature of AD in terms of the early biochemical events that correlate with disease progression. We use a novel panel of biomolecules that appears in cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients. As changes in the relative abundance of these molecular markers are associated with progression to AD from mild cognitive impairment, we make the assumption that by tracking their origins we can identify the biochemical conditions that predispose their presence and consequently cause the onset of AD. We couple these protein markers with an analysis of a series of genetic factors and together this hypothesis essentially allows us to redefine AD in terms of the molecular pathways that underlie the disease.

24685176|t|Soluble Abeta oligomers are rapidly sequestered from brain ISF in vivo and bind GM1 ganglioside on cellular membranes.
24685176|a|Soluble Abeta oligomers contribute importantly to synaptotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease, but their dynamics in vivo remain unclear. Here, we found that soluble Abeta oligomers were sequestered from brain interstitial fluid onto brain membranes much more rapidly than nontoxic monomers and were recovered in part as bound to GM1 ganglioside on membranes. Abeta oligomers bound strongly to GM1 ganglioside, and blocking the sialic acid residue on GM1 decreased oligomer-mediated LTP impairment in mouse hippocampal slices. In a hAPP transgenic mouse model, substantial levels of GM1-bound Abeta42 were recovered from brain membrane fractions. We also detected GM1-bound Abeta in human CSF, and its levels correlated with Abeta42, suggesting its potential as a biomarker of Abeta-related membrane dysfunction. Together, these findings highlight a mechanism whereby hydrophobic Abeta oligomers become sequestered onto GM1 ganglioside and presumably other lipids on neuronal membranes, where they may induce progressive functional and structural changes.

24685633|t|Age-dependent increment of hydroxymethylation in the brain cortex in the triple-transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
24685633|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex disorder whose etiology is associated with environmental and genetic factors. Recently there have been several attempts to analyze the role of epigenetic alterations in the origin and progression of this neurodegenerative condition. To evaluate the potential participation of the methylation status of the genome that may contribute to AD progression, we have studied the levels and distribution of the 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in different brain regions at different ages. We analyzed and quantified the immunosignal of these two epigenetic marks in young versus old wild-type mice and in the triple-transgenic mouse model of AD (3xTg-AD). The results show a decline in global 5-methylcytosine mark over time in all studied brain regions concomitant with a significant and widespread increase in 5-hydroxymethylcytosine mark in the aged transgenic mice in contrast to the age-matched controls. These differences in the methylation pattern of brain DNA in the 3xTg-AD that accumulates along age indicates abnormal formation of permissive chromatin structure associated with the increase in AD-related markers.

24687165|t|Arterial stiffness and beta-amyloid progression in nondemented elderly adults.
24687165|a|IMPORTANCE: Recent studies show that cerebral beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition is associated with blood pressure and measures of arterial stiffness in nondemented individuals. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between measures of arterial stiffness and change in Abeta deposition over time. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Deposition of Abeta was determined in a longitudinal observational study of aging by positron emission tomography using the Pittsburgh compound B twice 2 years apart in 81 nondemented individuals 83 years and older. Arterial stiffness was measured with a noninvasive and automated waveform analyzer at the time closest to the second positron emission tomography scan. All measures were performed under standardized conditions. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured in the central (carotid-femoral and heart-femoral PWV), peripheral (femoral-ankle PWV), and mixed (brachial-ankle PWV) vascular beds. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The change in Abeta deposition over 2 years was calculated from the 81 individuals with repeat Abeta-positron emission tomography. RESULTS: The proportion of Abeta-positive individuals increased from 48% at baseline to 75% at follow-up. Brachial-ankle PWV was significantly higher among Abeta-positive participants at baseline and follow-up. Femoral-ankle PWV was only higher among Abeta-positive participants at follow-up. Measures of central stiffness and blood pressure were not associated with Abeta status at baseline or follow-up, but central stiffness was associated with a change in Abeta deposition over time. Each standard deviation increase in central stiffness (carotid-femoral PWV, P = .001; heart-femoral PWV, P = .004) was linked with increases in Abeta deposition over 2 years. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study showed that Abeta deposition increases with age in nondemented individuals and that arterial stiffness is strongly associated with the progressive deposition of Abeta in the brain, especially in this age group. The association between Abeta deposition changes over time and generalized arterial stiffness indicated a relationship between the severity of subclinical vascular disease and progressive cerebral Abeta deposition.

24687915|t|Modulation of amyloid precursor protein expression reduces beta-amyloid deposition in a mouse model.
24687915|a|OBJECTIVE: Proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) generates beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides. Prolonged accumulation of Abeta in the brain underlies the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD) and is regarded as a principal target for development of disease-modifying therapeutics. METHODS: Using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) APP751SW cells, we identified and characterized effects of 2-([pyridine-2-ylmethyl]-amino)-phenol (2-PMAP) on APP steady-state level and Abeta production. Outcomes of 2-PMAP treatment on Abeta accumulation and associated memory deficit were studied in APPSW /PS1dE9 AD transgenic model mice. RESULTS: In CHO APP751SW cells, 2-PMAP lowered the steady-state APP level and inhibited Abetax-40 and Abetax-42 production in a dose-response manner with a minimum effective concentration <= 0.5muM. The inhibitory effect of 2-PMAP on translational efficiency of APP mRNA into protein was directly confirmed using a 35S-methionine/cysteine metabolic labeling technique, whereas APP mRNA level remained unaltered. Administration of 2-PMAP to APPSW /PS1dE9 mice reduced brain levels of full-length APP and its C-terminal fragments and lowered levels of soluble Abetax-40 and Abetax-42 . Four-month chronic treatment of APPSW /PS1dE9 mice revealed no observable toxicity and improved animals' memory performance. 2-PMAP treatment also caused significant reduction in brain Abeta deposition determined by both unbiased quantification of Abeta plaque load and biochemical analysis of formic acid-extracted Abetax-40 and Abetax-42 levels and the level of oligomeric Abeta. INTERPRETATION: We demonstrate the potential of modulating APP steady-state expression level as a safe and effective approach for reducing Abeta deposition in AD transgenic model mice.

24689364|t|Rationally designed peptoids modulate aggregation of amyloid-beta 40.
24689364|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. Plaques composed of aggregated amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) accumulate between the neural cells in the brain and are associated with dementia and cellular death. Many strategies have been investigated to prevent Abeta self-assembly into disease-associated beta-sheet amyloid aggregates; however, a promising therapeutic has not yet been identified. In this study, a peptoid-based mimic of the peptide KLVFF (residues 16-20 of Abeta) was tested for its ability to modulate Abeta aggregation. Peptoid JPT1 includes chiral, aromatic side chains to induce formation of a stable helical secondary structure that allows for greater interaction between the aromatic side chains and the cross beta-sheet of Abeta. JPT1 was found to modulate Abeta40 aggregation, specifically decreasing lag time to beta-sheet aggregate formation as well as the total number of fibrillar, beta-sheet structured aggregates formed. These results suggest that peptoids may be able to limit the formation of Abeta aggregates that are associated with AD.

24689444|t|Transthyretin-derived peptides as beta-amyloid inhibitors.
24689444|a|Self-association of beta-amyloid (Abeta) into soluble oligomers and fibrillar aggregates is associated with Alzheimer's disease pathology, motivating the search for compounds that selectively bind to and inhibit Abeta oligomerization and/or neurotoxicity. Numerous small-molecule inhibitors of Abeta aggregation or toxicity have been reported in the literature. However, because of their greater size and complexity, peptides and peptidomimetics may afford improved specificity and affinity as Abeta aggregation modulators compared to small molecules. Two divergent strategies have been employed in the search for peptides that bind Abeta: (i) using recognition domains corresponding to sequences in Abeta itself (such as KLVFF) and (ii) screening random peptide-based libraries. In this study, we propose a third strategy, specifically, designing peptides that mimic binding domains of Abeta-binding proteins. Transthyretin, a plasma transport protein that is also relatively abundant in cerebrospinal fluid, has been shown to bind to Abeta, inhibit aggregation, and reduce its toxicity. Previously, we identified strand G of transthyretin as a specific Abeta binding domain. In this work we further explore and define the necessary features of this binding domain. We demonstrate that peptides derived from transthyretin bind Abeta and inhibit its toxicity. We also show that, although both transthyretin and transthyretin-derived peptides bind Abeta and inhibit toxicity, they differ significantly in their effect on Abeta aggregation.

24691405|t|BACE1 (beta-secretase) inhibitors for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
24691405|a|BACE1 (beta-secretase, memapsin 2, Asp2) has emerged as a promising target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. BACE1 is an aspartic protease which functions in the first step of the pathway leading to the production and deposition of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta). Its gene deletion showed only mild phenotypes. BACE1 inhibition has direct implications in the Alzheimer's disease pathology without largely affecting viability. However, inhibiting BACE1 selectively in vivo has presented many challenges to medicinal chemists. Since its identification in 2000, inhibitors covering many different structural classes have been designed and developed. These inhibitors can be largely classified as either peptidomimetic or non-peptidic inhibitors. Progress in these fields resulted in inhibitors that contain many targeted drug-like characteristics. In this review, we describe structure-based design strategies and evolution of a wide range of BACE1 inhibitors including compounds that have been shown to reduce brain Abeta, rescue the cognitive decline in transgenic AD mice and inhibitor drug candidates that are currently in clinical trials.

24694662|t|Ameliorating effects of HX106N, a water-soluble botanical formulation, on Abeta25-35-induced memory impairment and oxidative stress in mice.
24694662|a|It is well-established that amyloid beta (Abeta)-induced oxidative stress plays a crucial role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its cognitive deficits. HX106N is a water-soluble extract prepared from a mixture of the plants Dimocarpus longan, Liriope platyphylla, Salvia miltiorrhiza, and Gastrodia elata. These ingredients are traditionally used in various plant-based medicines for the treatment of neurological disease. In this study, we examined the effects of HX106N on memory impairment and oxidative stress caused by the intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta25-35 peptide in mice. For one week prior to Abeta25-35 peptide injection and 8 d after, mice were given oral HX106N. HX106N treatment reversed the Abeta25-35-mediated decrease in alternation percentage and latency time in the Y-maze and passive avoidance tests. Mice treated with HX106N showed decreased levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), a lipid peroxidation marker. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) demonstrated that HX106 treatment increased levels of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in the hippocampus of Abeta25-35-injected mice, while having little effect on the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1beta. In the murine hippocampal neuronal cell line HT22, HX106N was found to upregulate HO-1 expression at the RNA and protein levels as well as to protect cells from glutamate-induced oxidative stress. Taken together, our data suggest that HX106N may potentially act as a preventive and/or therapeutic agent for AD.

24695987|t|Physical activity and risk of pancreatic cancer in a central European multicenter case-control study.
24695987|a|PURPOSE: Findings from epidemiological studies examining physical activity in relation to pancreatic cancer risk have suggested decreased risks for physical activity; however, the results are inconsistent. METHODS: The association between occupational and leisure-time physical activity and risk of pancreatic cancer was examined among 826 pancreatic cancer cases and 930 age-, sex- and center-matched controls from a large multicenter central European study in Czech Republic and Slovakia recruited between 2004 and 2012. Data on physical activity including type and dose (frequency, intensity, and duration) were examined using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models. RESULTS: Occupational physical activity was not significantly associated with risk of pancreatic cancer [odds ratio (OR) 0.90, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.71-1.15]. A 35 % decrease in risk of pancreatic cancer was observed for regular leisure-time physical activity (OR 0.65, 95 % CI 0.52-0.87). The risk estimates were significant for low and moderate intensity of activity with the strongest protective effect among individuals who exercised during more than 40 weeks per year. The results for cumulated leisure-time physical activity assessed 1 year prior to diagnosis achieved the same level of risk reduction. In addition, stronger risk estimates for leisure-time physical activity were observed among women (men: OR 0.74, 95 % CI 0.54-1.01; women: OR 0.53, 95 % CI 0.37-0.75). The findings for female participants were stronger for intensity and frequency of leisure-time physical activity, in particular for light and moderate activity (OR 0.43, 95 % CI 0.25-0.75; and OR 0.57, 95 % CI 0.37-0.88, respectively). CONCLUSION: These results provide evidence for a decreased risk of pancreatic cancer associated with regular leisure-time physical activity.

24702820|t|18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, aging, and apolipoprotein E genotype in cognitively normal persons.
24702820|a|Our objective was to examine associations between glucose metabolism, as measured by (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET), and age and to evaluate the impact of carriage of an apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele on glucose metabolism and on the associations between glucose metabolism and age. We studied 806 cognitively normal (CN) and 70 amyloid-imaging-positive cognitively impaired participants (35 with mild cognitive impairment and 35 with Alzheimer's disease [AD] dementia) from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, Mayo Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and an ancillary study who had undergone structural MRI, FDG PET, and (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET. Using partial volume corrected and uncorrected FDG PET glucose uptake ratios, we evaluated associations of regional FDG ratios with age and carriage of an APOE epsilon4 allele in CN participants between the ages of 30 and 95 years, and compared those findings with the cognitively impaired participants. In region-of-interest (ROI) analyses, we found modest but statistically significant declines in FDG ratio in most cortical and subcortical regions as a function of age. We also found a main effect of APOE epsilon4 genotype on FDG ratio, with greater uptake in epsilon4 noncarriers compared with carriers but only in the posterior cingulate and/or precuneus, lateral parietal, and AD-signature meta-ROI. The latter consisted of voxels from posterior cingulate and/or precuneus, lateral parietal, and inferior temporal. In age- and sex-matched CN participants the magnitude of the difference in partial volume corrected FDG ratio in the AD-signature meta-ROI for APOE epsilon4 carriers compared with noncarriers was about 4 times smaller than the magnitude of the difference between age- and sex-matched elderly APOE epsilon4 carrier CN compared with AD dementia participants. In an analysis in participants older than 70 years (31.3% of whom had elevated PiB), there was no interaction between PiB status and APOE epsilon4 genotype with respect to glucose metabolism. Glucose metabolism declines with age in many brain regions. Carriage of an APOE epsilon4 allele was associated with reductions in FDG ratio in the posterior cingulate and/or precuneus, lateral parietal, and AD-signature ROIs, and there was no interaction between age and APOE epsilon4 status. The posterior cingulate and/or precuneus and lateral parietal regions have a unique vulnerability to reductions in glucose metabolic rate as a function both of age and carriage of an APOE epsilon4 allele.

24706035|t|The flavonoid derivative 2-(4' Benzyloxyphenyl)-3-hydroxy-chromen-4-one protects against Abeta42-induced neurodegeneration in transgenic Drosophila: insights from in silico and in vivo studies.
24706035|a|In the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), it is well established that the self-association of Abeta peptides into amyloid fibrils and/or plaque like aggregates causes neurotoxicity. As there is no cure for AD till date, identification of specific compounds that either inhibit the formation of Abeta-fibrils or help in the dissolution of already formed amyloid plaques makes an appealing therapeutic and preventive strategy in the development of drugs. In the present study, four synthetic flavonoid derivatives (1, 2, 3 and 4) were examined for docking studies with Amyloid beta (PDB Code: 1IYT) and Amyloid fibril (PDB Code: 2BEG). Of these, compound 1 and 4 were found to be potential inhibitors, as supported by computational molecular docking studies with adequate pharmacokinetic properties. Compound 1 was further tested in vivo in transgenic AD model of Drosophila. The disease causing human Abeta42 peptide was expressed in the compound eye by driving UAS-Abeta42 with ey-GAL4, which caused severe degeneration in eye tissues ranging from loss of bristles, ommatidial holes to severe ommatidial disruption as revealed by digital camera imaging and scanning electron microscopy. When the Abeta42 expressing larvae were grown in medium containing Compound 1, ~70 % rescue of the rough eye phenotype was observed at 75 and 100 muM concentrations. This is further corroborated by significant reduction in amyloid plaques in eye imaginal disks of compound 1 treated larvae as revealed by immuno-confocal imaging studies. Further, rescue of locomotor deficit and improved life span in compound 1 treated Abeta flies also confirm the neuroprotective activity of this compound. Thus, our results support the neuroprotective efficacy of compound 1 in preventing Abeta42-induced neurotoxicity in vivo and identify it as a future therapeutic agent against AD.

24707838|t|Short communication: spectrum of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in an urban Ryan White-funded clinic in the established antiretroviral era.
24707838|a|People living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) are at a higher risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The influence of combined antiretrovirals (cART) on the presentation, treatment, and outcomes of HIV-associated NHL (HIV-NHL) warrants further investigation. We performed a retrospective analysis of PLWHA diagnosed with NHL who received care at the Infectious Diseases Ponce de Leon Center in Atlanta, Georgia, from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2010. Thirty-five patients with HIV-NHL were identified. Among these patients, 7 had Burkitt lymphoma (BL), 20 had diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 7 had plasmablastic lymphoma (PL), and 1 had primary effusion lymphoma (PEL). The majority of patients (82.9%) presented with advanced disease, and 63% were not on ART at diagnosis. Despite having good performance status at presentation, the majority of patients presented with high International Prognostic Index (IPI) scores. There were differences between the histologic subtypes of NHL in regard to treatment, complications, and outcomes. The median CD4 lymphocyte count at diagnosis was 110 cells/mm(3) for patients with DLBCL [interquartile range (IQR): 66, 203], 165 cells/mm(3) for Burkitt lymphoma (IQR: 36, 199), and 98 cells/mm(3) for plasmablastic lymphoma (IQR: 34, 214). Overall, patients completed 67% of planned chemotherapy cycles. Common causes for chemotherapy termination were persistent myelosuppression (18.2%), social factors (22.7%), and disease progression (36.4%). Social factors included lack of transportation, substance abuse, unstable housing, and poor adherence. Two-year overall survival was 40% for all HIV-NHL. Half of the patients with DLBCL (n=10), 42% of patients with PL (n=3), and only 14.3% of patients with BL (n=1) were alive at 2 years. Among the overall survivors at 2 years, 85.7% had CD4 >200 cells/mm(3) and 78.6% had undetectable HIV viral loads (VL) at that time.

24709310|t|Intracellular amyloid beta alters the tight junction of retinal pigment epithelium in 5XFAD mice.
24709310|a|Extracellular deposit of amyloid beta (Abeta) is a common pathologic feature in both age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and Alzheimer's disease, but the role of intracellular Abeta on the tight junction of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is unknown. In this study, we investigated the intracellular Abeta expression and its role on the outer blood retinal barrier in the retina of 5XFAD mice, a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. The retina of 5XFAD mice showed the pathologic features of AMD with intracellular Abeta in the RPE. As intracellular Abeta accumulated, zonular occludens-1 and occludin were markedly attenuated and lost their integrity as tight junctions in the RPE of 5XFAD mice. Also, Abeta42 uptake by ARPE-19 cells induced the tight junction breakdown of zonular occludens-1 and occludin without cell death. These results implicate that intracellular Abeta42 could play a role in the breakdown of the outer blood retinal barrier in 5XFAD mice. Thus, we suggested that 5XFAD mice could be a mouse model of dry AMD with regard to the Abeta42 related pathology.

24709401|t|Genetic comparison of Glossina tachinoides populations in three river basins of the Upper West Region of Ghana and implications for tsetse control.
24709401|a|Tsetse flies are the cyclical vectors of African animal trypanosomosis (AAT) and human African trypanosomosis (HAT). In March 2010, the Government of Ghana initiated a large scale integrated tsetse eradication campaign in the Upper West Region (UWR) ( 18,000 km(2)) under the umbrella of the Pan-African Tsetse and Trypanosomosis Eradication Campaign (PATTEC). We investigated the structuring of Glossina tachinoides populations within and between the three main river basins of the target area in the UWR. Out of a total sample of 884 flies, a sub-sample of 266 was genotyped at nine microsatellite loci. The significance of the different hierarchical levels was tested using Yang's parameters estimated with Weir and Cockerham's method. A significant effect of traps within groups (pooling traps no more than 3 km distant from each other), of groups within river basins and of river basins within the whole target area was observed. Isolation by distance between traps was highly significant. A local density of 0.48-0.61 flies/m(2) was estimated and a dispersal distance that approximated 11 m per generation [CI 9, 17]. No significant sex-biased dispersal was detected. Dispersal distances of G. tachinoides in the UWR were relatively low, possibly as a result of the fragmentation of the habitat and the seasonality of the Kulpawn and Sissili rivers. Moreover, very high fly population densities were observed in the sample sites, which potentially reduces dispersal at constant habitat saturation, because the probability that migrants can established is reduced (density dependent dispersal). However, the observed spatial dispersal was deemed sufficient for a G. tachinoides-cleared area to be reinvaded from neighboring populations in adjacent river basins. These data corroborate results from other population genetics studies in West Africa, which indicate that G. tachinoides populations from different river basins cannot be considered isolated.

24710074|t|Cholesterol and metal ions in Alzheimer's disease.
24710074|a|Cholesterol and metal ions have been suggested to be associated with the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Moreover, recent findings have demonstrated a potential interconnection between these two factors. For example, (a) cholesterol has been shown to be misregulated in AD-afflicted brains, and the aberrant activity of proteins (particularly, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (HMGR)) has been linked to cholesterol-related AD exacerbation; (b) dyshomeostasis of metal ions associated with misfolded proteins (i.e., amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregates) found in the brains of AD patients is shown to promote oxidative stress leading to the malfunction of multiple proteins, including cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1); (c) metal ion misregulation has also been observed to disrupt the activity of proteins (e.g., HMGR, low-density lipoproteins (LDL)), required for cholesterol production and regulation. Herein, we briefly discuss the potential involvement of cholesterol and metal ions in AD neuropathogenesis in both individual and interrelated manners.

24710686|t|Mitochondrial toxic effects of Abeta through mitofusins in the early pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
24710686|a|Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it is obscure how amyloid-beta (Abeta) can impair mitochondria in the early stage of AD pathology. Using PrP-hAPP/hPS1 double-transgenic AD mouse model, we find that abnormal mitochondrial morphology and damaged mitochondrial structure in hippocampal neurons appear in the early stage of AD-like disease development. We also find consistent mitochondrial abnormalities in the SH-SY5Y cells, which express amyloid precursor protein (APP) Swedish mutation (APPsw) and have been used as a cell model of the early-onset AD. Significant changes of mitofusin GTPases (Mfn1 and Mfn2) were detected both in the PrP-hAPP/hPS1 brains and SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, our results show that Abeta accumulation in neurons of PrP-hAPP/hPS1 mice can affect the neurogenesis prior to plaque formation. These findings suggest that mitochondrial impairment is a very early event in AD pathogenesis and abnormal expression of Mfn1 and Mfn2 caused by excessive intracellular Abeta is the possible molecular mechanism. Interestingly, L-theanine has significant effects on regulating mitochondrial fusion proteins in SH-SY5Y (APPsw) cells. Overall, our results not only suggest a new early mechanism of AD pathogenesis but also propose a preventive candidate, L-theanine, for the treatment of AD.

24711255|t|Bone marrow 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography cannot replace bone marrow biopsy in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
24711255|a|This study aimed to investigate whether visual and quantitative (18) F-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT)-based bone marrow assessment can replace blind bone marrow biopsy (BMB) in newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). This retrospective study included 78 patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL who had undergone both FDG-PET/CT and BMB. FDG-PET/CT images were visually evaluated for bone marrow involvement. Patient-based sensitivity of visual FDG-PET/CT assessment was calculated using BMB as the reference standard. Metabolically active volume, maximum standardized uptake value, 3D partial volume corrected mean standardized uptake value, and 3D partial volume corrected mean metabolic volume product (cMVPmean ) of FDG-avid bone marrow lesions were measured. Cox regression analysis was used to determine the influence of (potential) prognostic factors (BMB status, visual [dichotomous] FDG-PET/CT bone marrow status, metabolically active volume, maximum standardized uptake value, 3D partial volume corrected mean standardized uptake value, 3D partial volume corrected mean metabolic volume product, and International Prognostic Index score) on progression-free survival and overall survival. FDG-PET/CT detected bone marrow involvement in 34 (43.6%) cases and BMB in 16 (20.5%) of 78 cases, of whom 11 were also detected by FDG-PET/CT, resulting in a patient-based sensitivity of 68.8% (95% confidence interval = 44.2%-86.1%) for FDG-PET/CT. In the multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, only BMB status was an independent predictive factor of progression-free survival (P = 0.016) and overall survival (P = 0.004). In conclusion, FDG-PET/CT misses bone marrow involvement that has been detected by BMB in a non-negligible proportion of patients. Furthermore, both visual and quantitative FDG-PET/CT-based bone marrow assessments are prognostically inferior to BMB. Therefore, FDG-PET/CT cannot replace BMB in newly diagnosed DLBCL.

24713001|t|Synapto-depressive effects of amyloid beta require PICK1.
24713001|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta), a key component in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, is thought to target excitatory synapses early in the disease. However, the mechanism by which Abeta weakens synapses is not well understood. Here we showed that the PDZ domain protein, protein interacting with C kinase 1 (PICK1), was required for Abeta to weaken synapses. In mice lacking PICK1, elevations of Abeta failed to depress synaptic transmission in cultured brain slices. In dissociated cultured neurons, Abeta failed to reduce surface alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor subunit 2, a subunit of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors that binds with PICK1 through a PDZ ligand-domain interaction. Lastly, a novel small molecule (BIO922) discovered through structure-based drug design that targets the specific interactions between GluA2 and PICK1 blocked the effects of Abeta on synapses and surface receptors. We concluded that GluA2-PICK1 interactions are a key component of the effects of Abeta on synapses.

24714183|t|[Current status of "hospital-clinic" and "hospital-pharmacy" cooperation for inhalation therapy -based on hospital surveys throughout Japan].
24714183|a|BACKGROUND: The "zero death from asthma strategy" in the medical treatment for bronchial asthma has been promoted by the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare from 2006, and it indicates that medical and non-medical specialists, as well as pharmacists, should cooperate, and strives to build cooperation which is suited the actual conditions of an area. It is also important for COPD. Although hospitals in some areas cooperate with clinics and pharmacies, the overall concept of cooperation appears to be absent in most Japanese hospitals. METHOD: A questionnaire was administered in early March, 2012 to 477 allergology institutions, and was authorized by an educational establishment. RESULT: Among 246 replies from the institutions, cooperation between hospitals and clinics was carried out by 98 institutions (39.8%) specializing in bronchial asthma, and in 64 institutions (37.2%) specializing in COPD. However, cooperation tools were used in only 37 of these institutions (15.0%). The ability to fill prescriptions outside the hospital was available in 209 institutions (85.0%). One-hundred and seventeen institutions (47.6%) replied that they have no tools for hospital-pharmacy cooperation. Direct indications were written in prescriptions by 82 institutions (33.3). CONCLUSION: In order to build inter-regional association and to equalize medical treatment, we suggest that developing tools and organization for cooperation between health professionals who treat patients with bronchial asthma and COPD is necessary.

24716661|a|Genetic defects in MOGS, the gene encoding mannosyl-oligosaccharide glucosidase (the first enzyme in the processing pathway of N-linked oligosaccharide), cause the rare congenital disorder of glycosylation type IIb (CDG-IIb), also known as MOGS-CDG. MOGS is expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum and is involved in the trimming of N-glycans. We evaluated two siblings with CDG-IIb who presented with multiple neurologic complications and a paradoxical immunologic phenotype characterized by severe hypogammaglobulinemia but limited clinical evidence of an infectious diathesis. A shortened immunoglobulin half-life was determined to be the mechanism underlying the hypogammaglobulinemia. Impaired viral replication and cellular entry may explain a decreased susceptibility to infections.

24717093|t|Rare individual amyloid-beta oligomers act on astrocytes to initiate neuronal damage.
24717093|a|Oligomers of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide have been implicated in the neurotoxicity associated with Alzheimer's disease. We have used single-molecule techniques to examine quantitatively the cellular effects of adding well characterized Abeta oligomers to primary hippocampal cells and hence determine the initial pathway of damage. We found that even picomolar concentrations of Abeta (1-40) and Abeta (1-42) oligomers can, within minutes of addition, increase the levels of intracellular calcium in astrocytes but not in neurons, and this effect is saturated at a concentration of about 10 nM of oligomers. Both Abeta (1-40) and Abeta (1-42) oligomers have comparable effects. The rise in intracellular calcium is followed by an increase in the rate of ROS production by NADPH oxidase in both neurons and astrocytes. The increase in ROS production then triggers caspase-3 activation resulting in the inhibition of long-term potentiation. Our quantitative approach also reveals that only a small fraction of the oligomers are damaging and that an individual rare oligomer binding to an astrocyte can initiate the aforementioned cascade of responses, making it unlikely to be due to any specific interaction. Preincubating the Abeta oligomers with an extracellular chaperone, clusterin, sequesters the oligomers in long-lived complexes and inhibits all of the physiological damage, even at a ratio of 100:1, total Abeta to clusterin. To explain how Abeta oligomers are so damaging but that it takes decades to develop Alzheimer's disease, we suggest a model for disease progression where small amounts of neuronal damage from individual unsequestered oligomers can accumulate over time leading to widespread tissue-level dysfunction.

24717291|t|Synthesis and evaluation of ethyleneoxylated and allyloxylated chalcone derivatives for imaging of amyloid beta plaques by SPECT.
24717291|a|We report radioiodinated chalcone derivatives as new SPECT imaging probes for amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques. The monoethyleneoxy derivative 2 and allyloxy derivative 8 showed a high affinity for Abeta(1-42) aggregates with Ki values of 24 and 4.5 nM, respectively. Fluorescent imaging demonstrated that 2 and 8 clearly stained thioflavin-S positive Abeta plaques in the brain sections of Tg2576 transgenic mice. In vitro autoradiography revealed that [(125)I]2 displayed no clear accumulation toward Abeta plaques in the brain sections of Tg2576 mice, whereas the accumulation pattern of [(125)I]8 matched with the presence of Abeta plaques both in the brain sections of Tg2576 mice and an AD patient. In biodistribution studies using normal mice, [(125)I]2 showed preferable in vivo pharmacokinetics (4.82%ID/g at 2 min and 0.45%ID/g at 60 min), while [(125)I]8 showed only a modest brain uptake (1.62%ID/g at 2 min) with slow clearance (0.56%ID/g at 60 min). [(125)I]8 showed prospective binding properties for Abeta plaques, although further structural modifications are needed to improve the blood brain barrier permeability and washout from brain.

24719099|a|Normal aging is often difficult to distinguish from the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease. Years before clinical memory deficits manifest, amyloid-beta deposits in the cortex in many older individuals. Neuroimaging studies indicate that a set of densely connected neocortical regions, referred to as the default network, is especially vulnerable to amyloid-beta deposition. Yet, the impact of amyloid-beta on age-related changes within the medial temporal lobe (MTL) memory system is less clear. Here we demonstrate that cognitively normal older humans, compared with young adults, show reduced ability to modulate hippocampal activations and entorhinal deactivations during an episodic memory task. Among older adults, amyloid-beta deposition was associated with failure to modulate activity in entorhinal cortex, but not hippocampus. Furthermore, we show that entorhinal regions demonstrating amyloid-beta-related dysfunction are directly connected to the neocortical regions of the default network. Together these findings link neocortical amyloid-beta deposition to neuronal dysfunction specifically in entorhinal cortex, while aging is associated with more widespread functional changes across the MTL.

24720730|t|The coexistence of an equal amount of Alzheimer's amyloid-beta 40 and 42 forms structurally stable and toxic oligomers through a distinct pathway.
24720730|a|Fibrillar amyloid-beta (Abeta) is the major constituent of senile plaques in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta is a short peptide generated from amyloid precursor protein with two main isoforms, Abeta40 and Abeta42, with the latter having two additional hydrophobic residues at the C-terminus. The two isoforms have distinct characteristics, in which Abeta42 plays a more pathogenic role. Some early-onset familial AD cases possess an elevated Abeta42/Abeta40 level, and biochemical studies show the two species interact with each other. Therefore, understanding structural conversion in the aggregation of mixed Abeta isoforms is essential for elucidating AD pathogenesis. Here, we systematically examined the differences between Abeta42, Abeta40 and various Abeta42/Abeta40 mixtures by monitoring the fibrillization kinetics, epitope changes, assembly, morphology and induced cytotoxicity. We found that the minor Abeta species in different mixing ratios modulated the major aggregation pathway. Size exclusion chromatography, circular dichroism spectroscopy and photo-crosslinking assay showed that soluble Abeta42 oligomers were stabilized after Abeta40 addition, and the equimolar Abeta42/Abeta40 mixture rapidly formed spherical oligomers. These oligomers were the most toxic among those examined as evidenced by neurite degeneration and neuronal toxicity. However, the oligomers were not responsible for intracellular calcium elevation. Overall, our results demonstrated that differently mixed Abeta species repartitioned oligomer intermediates on the major aggregation pathway. Furthermore, the equimolar mixture rapidly formed structurally stable and the most toxic oligomers. These results provided information on the potential pathological mechanisms underlying the elevated Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio in familial AD patients and in the local environment of sporadic AD brains.

24720891|t|RCAN1 increases Abeta generation by promoting N-glycosylation via oligosaccharyltransferase.
24720891|a|Glycosylation is one of the major post-translational modifications, required for proper folding and functions of glycoproteins. N-glycosylation in ER is mediated by oligosaccharyltransferase (OST), an enzyme complex transferring preassembled oligosaccharide to asparagine residues of nascent polypeptide chain. Our study here indicates that regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1) can enhance N-glycosylation in ER, therefore elevates the activities of beta- and gamma-secretase and markedly increases Abeta production. We found that RCAN1 stabilizes OST by interacting with OST component ribophorinI (RPN I). RCAN1 enhanced glycosylation of membrane proteins and glycosylation sequon GNSTVT, but has no effect on transferrin whose glycosylation was only affected by OST catalytic subunit STT3A, suggesting the effect of RCAN1 is associated with RPN I in facilitating substrate delivery. Our previous studies have shown that RCAN1 was increased in AD brains and RCAN1 overexpression induced neuronal apoptosis. Here our study showed that RCAN1 further contributes to AD pathogenesis by increasing N-glycosylation and Abeta production.

24721526|t|The cerebrospinal fluid "Alzheimer profile": easily said, but what does it mean?
24721526|a|BACKGROUND: We aimed to identify the most useful definition of the "cerebrospinal fluid Alzheimer profile," based on amyloid-ss1-42 (Abeta42), total tau, and phosphorylated tau (p-tau), for diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: We constructed eight Alzheimer profiles with previously published combinations, including regression formulas and simple ratios. We compared their diagnostic accuracy and ability to predict dementia due to AD in 1385 patients from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort. Results were validated in an independent cohort (n = 1442). RESULTS: Combinations outperformed individual biomarkers. Based on the sensitivity of the best performing regression formulas, cutoffs were chosen at 0.52 for the tau/Abeta42 ratio and 0.08 for the p-tau/Abeta42 ratio. Ratios performed similar to formulas (sensitivity, 91%-93%; specificity, 81%-84%). The same combinations best predicted cognitive decline in mild cognitive impairment patients. Validation confirmed these results, especially regarding the tau/Abeta42 ratio. CONCLUSIONS: A tau/Abeta42 ratio of >0.52 constitutes a robust cerebrospinal fluid Alzheimer profile. We recommend using this ratio to combine biomarkers.

24723110|t|Effects of acidic oligosaccharide sugar chain on amyloid oligomer-induced impairment of synaptic plasticity in rats.
24723110|a|Soluble amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) oligomers have been recognized to be early and key intermediates in Alzheimer's disease-related synaptic dysfunction. In this study, using in vitro electrophysiology, we investigated interactions of the acidic oligosaccharide sugar chain (AOSC), a marine-derived acidic oligosaccharide, with oligomeric Abeta. We found that the inhibition of long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by Abeta oligomers can be dose dependently reversed by the application of AOSC, whereas AOSC alone did not alter normal LTP induction. Interestingly, treatment with Abeta monomers with or without AOSC did not affect LTP induction. Additionally, when fresh-made Abeta was co-incubated with AOSC before in vitro testing, there was no impairment of LTP induction. The results from Western blots demonstrated that AOSC prevent the aggregation of Abeta oligomers. These findings indicate that AOSC may reverse Abeta oligomer-mediated cytotoxicity by directly disrupting the amyloid oligomer aggregation, and this action is concentration dependent. Thus, we propose that AOSC might be a potential therapeutic drug for Alzheimer's disease due to its protection against oligomeric Abeta-induced dysfunction of synaptic plasticity.

24725245|t|Comorbid rat model of ischemia and beta-amyloid toxicity: striatal and cortical degeneration.
24725245|a|Levels of cerebral amyloid, presumably beta-amyloid (Abeta), toxicity and the incidence of cortical and subcortical ischemia increases with age. However, little is known about the severe pathological condition and dementia that occur as a result of the comorbid occurrence of this vascular risk factor and Abeta toxicity. Clinical studies have indicated that small ischemic lesions in the striatum are particularly important in generating dementia in combination with minor amyloid lesions. These cognitive deficits are highly likely to be caused by changes in the cortex. In this study, we examined the viability and morphological changes in microglial and neuronal cells, gap junction proteins (connexin43) and neuritic/axonal retraction (Fer Kinase) in the striatum and cerebral cortex using a comorbid rat model of striatal injections of endothelin-1 (ET1) and Abeta toxicity. The results demonstrated ventricular enlargement, striatal atrophy, substantial increases in beta-amyloid, ramified microglia and increases in neuritic retraction in the combined models of stroke and Abeta toxicity. Changes in connexin43 occurred equally in both groups of Abeta-treated rats, with and without focal ischemia. Although previous behavioral tests demonstrated impairment in memory and learning, the visual discrimination radial maze task did not show significant difference, suggesting the cognitive impairment in these models is not related to damage to the dorsolateral striatum. These results suggest an insight into the relationship between cortical/striatal atrophy, pathology and functional impairment.

24726523|t|Attenuation of Abeta25-35-induced parallel autophagic and apoptotic cell death by gypenoside XVII through the estrogen receptor-dependent activation of Nrf2/ARE pathways.
24726523|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) has a pivotal function in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. To investigate Abeta neurotoxicity, we used an in vitro model that involves Abeta25-35-induced cell death in the nerve growth factor-induced differentiation of PC12 cells. Abeta25-35 (20muM) treatment for 24h caused apoptotic cell death, as evidenced by significant cell viability reduction, LDH release, phosphatidylserine externalization, mitochondrial membrane potential disruption, cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation, PARP cleavage, and DNA fragmentation in PC12 cells. Abeta25-35 treatment led to autophagic cell death, as evidenced by augmented GFP-LC3 puncta, conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, and increased LC3-II/LC3-I ratio. Abeta25-35 treatment induced oxidative stress, as evidenced by intracellular ROS accumulation and increased production of mitochondrial superoxide, malondialdehyde, protein carbonyl, and 8-OHdG. Phytoestrogens have been proved to be protective against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity and regarded as relatively safe targets for AD drug development. Gypenoside XVII (GP-17) is a novel phytoestrogen isolated from Gynostemma pentaphyllum or Panax notoginseng. Pretreatment with GP-17 (10muM) for 12h increased estrogen response element reporter activity, activated PI3K/Akt pathways, inhibited GSK-3beta, induced Nrf2 nuclear translocation, augmented antioxidant responsive element enhancer activity, upregulated heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) expression and activity, and provided protective effects against Abeta25-35-induced neurotoxicity, including oxidative stress, apoptosis, and autophagic cell death. In conclusion, GP-17 conferred protection against Abeta25-35-induced neurotoxicity through estrogen receptor-dependent activation of PI3K/Akt pathways, inactivation of GSK-3beta and activation of Nrf2/ARE/HO-1 pathways. This finding might provide novel insights into understanding the mechanism for neuroprotective effects of phytoestrogens or gypenosides.

24726762|t|An analytical framework for delirium research in palliative care settings: integrated epidemiologic, clinician-researcher, and knowledge user perspectives.
24726762|a|CONTEXT: Delirium often presents difficult management challenges in the context of goals of care in palliative care settings. OBJECTIVES: The aim was to formulate an analytical framework for further research on delirium in palliative care settings, prioritize the associated research questions, discuss the inherent methodological challenges associated with relevant studies, and outline the next steps in a program of delirium research. METHODS: We combined multidisciplinary input from delirium researchers and knowledge users at an international delirium study planning meeting, relevant literature searches, focused input of epidemiologic expertise, and a meeting participant and coauthor survey to formulate a conceptual research framework and prioritize research questions. RESULTS: Our proposed framework incorporates three main groups of research questions: the first was predominantly epidemiologic, such as delirium occurrence rates, risk factor evaluation, screening, and diagnosis; the second covers pragmatic management questions; and the third relates to the development of predictive models for delirium outcomes. Based on aggregated survey responses to each research question or domain, the combined modal ratings of "very" or "extremely" important confirmed their priority. CONCLUSION: Using an analytical framework to represent the full clinical care pathway of delirium in palliative care settings, we identified multiple knowledge gaps in relation to the occurrence rates, assessment, management, and outcome prediction of delirium in this population. The knowledge synthesis generated from adequately powered, multicenter studies to answer the framework's research questions will inform decision making and policy development regarding delirium detection and management and thus help to achieve better outcomes for patients in palliative care settings.

24726770|t|Peripheral administration of an anti-TNF-alpha receptor fusion protein counteracts the amyloid induced elevation of hippocampal TNF-alpha levels and memory deficits in mice.
24726770|a|Alzheimer's disease has long been associated with increased inflammation in the brain. Activated microglia and increased production of the inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, have been proposed to contribute to the onset and progression of the disease. We investigated if systemic administration of an anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) biologic medication clinically validated for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), TNF receptor 2 fused to a Fc domain (TNFR2:Fc), could ameliorate the behavioral symptoms and decrease neuroinflammation in a non-transgenic mouse model mimicking some hallmarks of the disease. Seven days after a single intracebroventricular (icv) injection of aggregated amyloid beta25-35 (9nmoles), mice displayed significant cognitive deficit in spontaneous alternation (working memory) and inhibitory avoidance (long-term memory) tasks. Alternation percentage decreased from 72.4%+-1.3 to chance level (52.6%+-1.7); step-through retention latency decreased from 247s to 144s. Subcutaneous administration of 30mg/kg TNFR2:Fc every second day post amyloid beta25-35 icv administration counteracted the amyloid-induced decrease in alternation percentage (66.4s+-1.8) and the decreased step-through retention latency (248s+-9). Measurement of hippocampal TNF-alpha levels by ELISA after behavioral assessment showed significant elevation in animals injected with amyloid beta25-35 relative to animals injected with control peptide. In animals treated with 30mg/kg TNFR2:Fc, TNF-alpha levels in the hippocampus were reduced and were similar to control animals. These data suggest that peripheral administration of TNFR2:Fc counteracts amyloid-induced memory impairment and normalizes increased TNF-alpha levels in hippocampus of a non-transgenic mouse model of amyloid induced cognitive deficit.

24726894|t|The prolyl isomerase Pin1 regulates hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF) activity.
24726894|a|Hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1 (HIF-1) plays a decisive role in cell survival and adaptation to hypoxic stress by controlling the expression of genes involved in oxygen homeostasis. HIF-1 activity is fine-tuned through specific post-translational modifications of its essential HIF-1alpha subunit. Among these modifications, phosphorylation is important for HIF-1 transcriptional activity. Studies have shown that the mitogen-activated protein kinases, p42/p44 MAPKs, directly phosphorylate HIF-1alpha and increase HIF-1-mediated transcription. Pin1, a peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase, targets a number of proteins containing a phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro motif. Pin1 isomerization causes a change in target protein conformation which can modify their activity. Here, we identify Pin1 as an important HIF-1alpha partner. Immunoprecipitation and pull-down studies show that Pin1 interacts with HIF-1alpha. We demonstrate that the interaction between Pin1 and HIF-1alpha is regulated through p42/p44 MAPK pathway activation. By performing proteolysis studies, our results indicate that Pin1 catalytic activity generates a conformational change in HIF-1alpha. Finally, our work shows that Pin1 is required for gene-specific HIF-1 transcriptional activity. Our results indicate that the prolyl isomerase Pin1 regulates HIF-1 transcriptional activity by interacting with HIF-1alpha and promoting conformational changes in a p42/p44 MAPK phosphorylation-dependent manner.

24728335|t|The screening of Alzheimer's patients with CSF biomarkers, modulates the distribution of APOE genotype: impact on clinical trials.
24728335|a|Polymorphism of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) plays a role in the level of neuropathological lesions and in drug response in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of this study was to investigate whether the selection of AD patients based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers assessment may be biased by their APOE distribution. We studied the relationships between APOE genotype and CSF biomarkers levels in a total of 432 patients (AD, n = 244; non-AD, n = 188) explored for cognitive disorders. We studied the distribution of APOE genotypes among AD patient subgroups selected by various cut-offs of CSF biomarkers. Strategies of screening based on CSF Abeta1-42 lead to overselection of epsilon4/epsilon4 patients in the AD group. Screening based on tau levels did not change Apoe4 distribution in the AD group. CSF Abeta1-42 discriminated better AD patients with at least one epsilon4 than AD patients with no epsilon4. A strong allele-effect relationship was detected between APOE genotype and CSF amyloid-beta (Abeta1-42) in AD patients. Selecting AD patients on CSF amyloid levels only may create an overselection of epsilon4/epsilon4 carriers, and might potentially bias the population of patients included in clinical trial studies.

24729013|t|Insights into the molecular interactions between aminopeptidase and amyloid beta peptide using molecular modeling techniques.
24729013|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides play a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The accumulation of Abeta peptides in AD brain was caused due to overproduction or insufficient clearance and defects in the proteolytic degradation of Abeta peptides. Hence, Abeta peptide degradation could be a promising therapeutic approach in AD treatment. Recent experimental report suggests that aminopeptidase from Streptomyces griseus KK565 (SGAK) can degrade Abeta peptides but the interactive residues are yet to be known in detail at the atomic level. Hence, we developed the three-dimensional model of aminopeptidase (SGAK) using SWISS-MODEL, Geno3D and MODELLER. Model built by MODELLER was used for further studies. Molecular docking was performed between aminopeptidase (SGAK) with wild-type and mutated Abeta peptides. The docked complex of aminopeptidase (SGAK) and wild-type Abeta peptide (1IYT.pdb) shows more stability than the other complexes. Molecular docking and MD simulation results revealed that the residues His93, Asp105, Glu139, Glu140, Asp168 and His255 are involved in the hydrogen bonding with Abeta peptide and zinc ions. The interactions between carboxyl oxygen atoms of Glu139 of aminopeptidase (SGAK) with water molecule suggest that the Glu139 may be involved in the nucleophilic attack on Ala2-Glu3 peptide bond of Abeta peptide. Hence, amino acid Glu139 of aminopeptidase (SGAK) might play an important role to degrade Abeta peptides, a causative agent of Alzheimer's disease.

24729203|t|Capillary electrophoresis for the analysis of the effect of sample preparation on early stages of Abeta1-40 aggregation.
24729203|a|Aggregation of the amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) contributes to the neurodegeneration characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. Of particular importance are the early stages of aggregation, which involve the formation of soluble oligomers and protofibrils. In these studies, we demonstrate the potential for CE with UV detection using a polyethylene oxide separation matrix to identify the evolution of various oligomeric species of Abeta1-40 . To demonstrate the efficacy of this technique, UV-CE was utilized to compare two methods commonly used to prepare Abeta for aggregation experiments and their effect on the formation of early aggregates. SEC-purified Abeta1-40 initially contained more small species, including monomer, than did freshly dissolved Abeta1-40 pretreated with hexafluoroisopropanol. Strikingly, the lag time to oligomer formation for SEC-isolated Abeta1-40 samples was ~23 h shorter compared to freshly dissolved Abeta1-40 samples. Furthermore, oligomers formed from the aggregation of SEC-purified Abeta1-40 persisted within solution for a longer period of time. These results indicate that the initial sample preparation has a drastic influence on the early stages of Abeta1-40 aggregation. This is the first report of the use of UV-CE with a separation matrix to study the effect of sample preparation on early aggregation of Abeta1-40 . UV-CE was also used in parallel with dot blot analysis and inhibitory compounds to discern structural characteristics of individual oligomer peaks, demonstrating the capacity of UV-CE as a complimentary technique to further understand the aggregation process.

24729983|t|Multimodal MRI-based Imputation of the Abeta+ in Early Mild Cognitive Impairment.
24729983|a|OBJECTIVE: To identify brain atrophy from structural-MRI and cerebral blood flow(CBF) patterns from arterial spin labeling perfusion-MRI that are best predictors of the Abeta-burden, measured as composite 18F-AV45-PET uptake, in individuals with early mild cognitive impairment(MCI). Furthermore, to assess the relative importance of imaging modalities in classification of Abeta+/Abeta- early mild cognitive impairment. METHODS: Sixty-seven ADNI-GO/2 participants with early-MCI were included. Voxel-wise anatomical shape variation measures were computed by estimating the initial diffeomorphic mapping momenta from an unbiased control template. CBF measures normalized to average motor cortex CBF were mapped onto the template space. Using partial least squares regression, we identified the structural and CBF signatures of Abeta after accounting for normal cofounding effects of age, sex, and education. RESULTS: 18F-AV45-positive early-MCIs could be identified with 83% classification accuracy, 87% positive predictive value, and 84% negative predictive value by multidisciplinary classifiers combining demographics data, ApoE epsilon4-genotype, and a multimodal MRI-based Abeta score. INTERPRETATION: Multimodal-MRI can be used to predict the amyloid status of early-MCI individuals. MRI is a very attractive candidate for the identification of inexpensive and non-invasive surrogate biomarkers of Abeta deposition. Our approach is expected to have value for the identification of individuals likely to be Abeta+ in circumstances where cost or logistical problems prevent Abeta detection using cerebrospinal fluid analysis or Abeta-PET. This can also be used in clinical settings and clinical trials, aiding subject recruitment and evaluation of treatment efficacy. Imputation of the Abeta-positivity status could also complement Abeta-PET by identifying individuals who would benefit the most from this assessment.

24735871|t|Gly25-Ser26 amyloid beta-protein structural isomorphs produce distinct Abeta42 conformational dynamics and assembly characteristics.
24735871|a|One of the earliest events in amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) self-association is nucleation of Abeta monomer folding through formation of a turn at Gly25-Lys28. We report here the effects of structural changes at the center of the turn, Gly25-Ser26, on Abeta42 conformational dynamics and assembly. We used "click peptide" chemistry to quasi-synchronously create Abeta42 from 26-O-acyliso-Abeta42 (iAbeta42) through a pH jump from 3 to 7.4. We also synthesized Nalpha-acetyl-Ser26-iAbeta42 (Ac-iAbeta42), which cannot undergo O N acyl chemistry, to study the behavior of this ester form of Abeta42 itself at neutral pH. Data from experiments monitoring increases in beta-sheet formation (thioflavin T, CD), hydrodynamic radius (RH), scattering intensity (quasielastic light scattering spectroscopy), and extent of oligomerization (ion mobility spectroscopy-mass spectrometry) were quite consistent. A rank order of Ac-iAbeta42>iAbeta42>Abeta42 was observed. Photochemically cross-linked iAbeta42 displayed an oligomer distribution with a prominent dimer band that was not present with Abeta42. These dimers also were observed selectively in iAbeta42 in ion mobility spectrometry experiments. The distinct biophysical behaviors of iAbeta42 and Abeta42 appear to be due to the conversion of iAbeta42 into "pure" Abeta42 monomer, a nascent form of Abeta42 that does not comprise the variety of oligomeric and aggregated states present in pre-existent Abeta42. These results emphasize the importance of the Gly25-Ser26 dipeptide in organizing Abeta42 monomer structure and thus suggest that drugs altering the interactions of this dipeptide with neighboring side-chain atoms or with the peptide backbone could be useful in therapeutic strategies targeting formation of Abeta oligomers and higher-order assemblies.

24736891|t|beta-Amyloid is associated with aberrant metabolic connectivity in subjects with mild cognitive impairment.
24736891|a|Positron emission tomography (PET) studies using [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) have identified a well-defined pattern of glucose hypometabolism in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The assessment of the metabolic relationship among brain regions has the potential to provide unique information regarding the disease process. Previous studies of metabolic correlation patterns have demonstrated alterations in AD subjects relative to age-matched, healthy control subjects. The objective of this study was to examine the associations between beta-amyloid, apolipoprotein E e4 (APOE e4) genotype, and metabolic correlations patterns in subjects diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Mild cognitive impairment subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study were categorized into beta-amyloid-low and beta-amyloid-high groups, based on quantitative analysis of [18F]florbetapir PET scans, and APOE e4 non-carriers and carriers based on genotyping. We generated voxel-wise metabolic correlation strength maps across the entire cerebral cortex for each group, and, subsequently, performed a seed-based analysis. We found that the APOE e4 genotype was closely related to regional glucose hypometabolism, while elevated, fibrillar beta-amyloid burden was associated with specific derangements of the metabolic correlation patterns.

24737040|t|The hairpin conformation of the amyloid beta peptide is an important structural motif along the aggregation pathway.
24737040|a|The amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides are 39-42 residue-long peptides found in the senile plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. These peptides self-aggregate in aqueous solution, going from soluble and mainly unstructured monomers to insoluble ordered fibrils. The aggregation process(es) are strongly influenced by environmental conditions. Several lines of evidence indicate that the neurotoxic species are the intermediate oligomeric states appearing along the aggregation pathways. This minireview summarizes recent findings, mainly based on solution and solid-state NMR experiments and electron microscopy, which investigate the molecular structures and characteristics of the Abeta peptides at different stages along the aggregation pathways. We conclude that a hairpin-like conformation constitutes a common motif for the Abeta peptides in most of the described structures. There are certain variations in different hairpin conformations, for example regarding H-bonding partners, which could be one reason for the molecular heterogeneity observed in the aggregated systems. Interacting hairpins are the building blocks of the insoluble fibrils, again with variations in how hairpins are organized in the cross-section of the fibril, perpendicular to the fibril axis. The secondary structure propensities can be seen already in peptide monomers in solution. Unfortunately, detailed structural information about the intermediate oligomeric states is presently not available. In the review, special attention is given to metal ion interactions, particularly the binding constants and ligand structures of Abeta complexes with Cu(II) and Zn(II), since these ions affect the aggregation process(es) and are considered to be involved in the molecular mechanisms underlying AD pathology.

24737189|t|Do patient and ward-related characteristics influence the use of coercive measures? Results from the EUNOMIA international study.
24737189|a|PURPOSE: This study aims to identify whether selected patient and ward-related factors are associated with the use of coercive measures. Data were collected as part of the EUNOMIA international collaborative study on the use of coercive measures in ten European countries. METHODS: Involuntarily admitted patients (N = 2,027) were divided into two groups. The first group (N = 770) included patients that had been subject to at least one of these coercive measures during hospitalization: restraint, and/or seclusion, and/or forced medication; the other group (N = 1,257) included patients who had not received any coercive measure during hospitalization. To identify predictors of use of coercive measures, both patients' sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and centre-related characteristics were tested in a multivariate logistic regression model, controlled for countries' effect. RESULTS: The frequency of the use of coercive measures varied significantly across countries, being higher in Poland, Italy and Greece. Patients who received coercive measures were more frequently male and with a diagnosis of psychotic disorder (F20-F29). According to the regression model, patients with higher levels of psychotic and hostility symptoms, and of perceived coercion had a higher risk to be coerced at admission. Controlling for countries' effect, the risk of being coerced was higher in Poland. Patients' sociodemographic characteristics and ward-related factors were not identifying as possible predictors because they did not enter the model. CONCLUSIONS: The use of coercive measures varied significantly in the participating countries. Clinical factors, such as high levels of psychotic symptoms and high levels of perceived coercion at admission were associated with the use of coercive measures, when controlling for countries' effect. These factors should be taken into consideration by programs aimed at reducing the use of coercive measures in psychiatric wards.

24740577|t|Do astrocytes collaborate with neurons in spreading the "infectious" abeta and Tau drivers of Alzheimer's disease?
24740577|a|Evidence has begun emerging for the "contagious" and destructive Abeta42 (amyloid-beta42) oligomers and phosphorylated Tau oligomers as drivers of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), which advances along a pathway starting from the brainstem or entorhinal cortex and leading to cognition-related upper cerebral cortex regions. Seemingly, Abeta42 oligomers trigger the events generating the neurotoxic Tau oligomers, which may even by themselves spread the characteristic AD neuropathology. It has been assumed that only neurons make and spread these toxic drivers, whereas their associated astrocytes are just janitorial bystanders/scavengers. But this view is likely to radically change since normal human astrocytes freshly isolated from adult cerebral cortex can be induced by exogenous Abeta25-35, an Abeta42 proxy, to make and secrete increased amounts of endogenous Abeta42. Thus, it would seem that the steady slow progression of AD neuropathology along specific cognition-relevant brain networks is driven by both Abeta42 and phosphorylated Tau oligomers that are variously released from increasing numbers of "contagion-stricken" members of tightly coupled neuron-astrocyte teams. Hence, we surmise that stopping the oversecretion and spread of the two kinds of "contagious" oligomers by such team members, perhaps via a specific CaSR (Ca(2+)-sensing receptor) antagonist like NPS 2143, might effectively treat AD.

24742670|t|Mint proteins are required for synaptic activity-dependent amyloid precursor protein (APP) trafficking and amyloid beta generation.
24742670|a|Aberrant amyloid beta (Abeta) production plays a causal role in Alzheimer disease pathogenesis. A major cellular pathway for Abeta generation is the activity-dependent endocytosis and proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). However, the molecules controlling activity-dependent APP trafficking in neurons are less defined. Mints are adaptor proteins that directly interact with the endocytic sorting motif of APP and are functionally important in regulating APP endocytosis and Abeta production. We analyzed neuronal cultures from control and Mint knockout neurons that were treated with either glutamate or tetrodotoxin to stimulate an increase or decrease in neuronal activity, respectively. We found that neuronal activation by glutamate increased APP endocytosis, followed by elevated APP insertion into the cell surface, stabilizing APP at the plasma membrane. Conversely, suppression of neuronal activity by tetrodotoxin decreased APP endocytosis and insertion. Interestingly, we found that activity-dependent APP trafficking and Abeta generation were blocked in Mint knockout neurons. We showed that wild-type Mint1 can rescue APP internalization and insertion in Mint knockout neurons. In addition, we found that Mint overexpression increased excitatory synaptic activity and that APP was internalized predominantly to endosomes associated with APP processing. We demonstrated that presenilin 1 (PS1) endocytosis requires interaction with the PDZ domains of Mint1 and that this interaction facilitates activity-dependent colocalization of APP and PS1. These findings demonstrate that Mints are necessary for activity-induced APP and PS1 trafficking and provide insight into the cellular fate of APP in endocytic pathways essential for Abeta production.

24746363|t|Altered arginine metabolism in Alzheimer's disease brains.
24746363|a|L-arginine is a semi-essential amino acid with a number of bioactive metabolites. Accumulating evidence suggests the implication of altered arginine metabolism in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present study systematically compared the metabolic profile of L-arginine in the superior frontal gyrus, hippocampus, and cerebellum from AD (mean age 80 years) and normal (mean age 80 or 60 years) cases. The activity and protein expression of nitric oxide synthase and arginase were altered with AD and age in a region-specific manner. There were also AD- and age-related changes in the tissue concentrations of L-arginine and its downstream metabolites (L-citrulline, L-ornithine, agmatine, putrescine, spermidine, spermine, glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and glutamine) in a metabolite- or region-specific manner. These findings demonstrate that arginine metabolism is dramatically altered in diverse regions of AD brains, thus meriting further investigation to understand its role in the pathogenesis and/or progression of the disease.

24746365|t|PDE9A inhibition rescues amyloid beta-induced deficits in synaptic plasticity and cognition.
24746365|a|The cyclic nucleotide cGMP is an important intracellular messenger for synaptic plasticity and memory function in rodents. Therefore, inhibition of cGMP degrading phosphodiesterases, like PDE9A, has gained interest as potential target for treatment of cognition deficits in indications like Alzheimer's disease (AD). In fact, PDE9A inhibition results in increased hippocampal long-term potentiation and exhibits procognitive effects in rodents. To date, however, no evidence has been published linking PDE9A inhibition to the pathologic hallmarks of AD such as amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition. Therefore, we investigated the role of PDE9A inhibition in an AD relevant context by testing its effects on Abeta-related deficits in synaptic plasticity and cognition. The PDE9A inhibitor BAY 73-6691 was found to restore long-term potentiation impaired by Abeta42 oligomers. Furthermore, we demonstrated that BAY 73-6691 enhanced cGMP levels in the hippocampus of APP transgenic tg2576 mice and improved memory performance of these mice. Altogether, our results support the hypothesis that inhibition of PDE9A could be a beneficial approach for the treatment of memory impairment in AD patients.

24747018|t|The role of choroid plexus in IVIG-induced beta-amyloid clearance.
24747018|a|We have shown that intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) contains anti-Abeta autoantibodies and IVIG could induce beta amyloid (Abeta) efflux from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to blood in both Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Alzheimer disease (AD) patients. However, the molecular mechanism underlying IVIG-induced Abeta efflux remains unclear. In this study, we used amyloid precursor protein (AbetaPP) transgenic mice to investigate if the IVIG could induce efflux of Abeta from the brain and whether low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1), a hypothetic Abeta transporter in blood-CSF barrier (BCB); could mediate this clearance process. We currently provide strong evidence to demonstrate that IVIG could reduce brain Abeta levels by pulling Abeta into the blood system in AbetaPP transgenic mice. In the mechanistic study, IVIG could induce Abeta efflux through the in vitro BCB membrane formed by cultured BCB epithelial cells. Both receptor-associated protein (RAP; a functional inhibitor of LRP1), and LRP1 siRNA were able to significantly inhibit the Abeta efflux. Should Abeta prove to be the underlying cause of AD, our results strongly suggest that IVIG could be beneficial in the therapy for AD by inducing efflux of Abeta from the brain through the LRP1 in the BCB.

24747275|a|The present study analyzed the possible anxiolytic, antidepressant and antioxidant proprieties of inhaled coriander volatile oil extracted from Coriandrum sativum var. microcarpum in beta-amyloid (1-42) rat model of Alzheimer's disease. The anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects of inhaled coriander volatile oil were studied by means of in vivo (elevated plus-maze and forced swimming tests) approaches. Also, the antioxidant activity in the hippocampus was assessed using catalase specific activity and the total content of the reduced glutathione. The beta-amyloid (1-42)-treated rats exhibited the following: decrease of the locomotor activity, the percentage of the time spent and the number of entries in the open arm within elevated plus-maze test and decrease of swimming and immobility times within forced swimming test. Exposure to coriander volatile oil significantly improved these parameters, suggesting anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects. Moreover, coriander volatile oil decreased catalase activity and increased glutathione level in the hippocampus. Our results suggest that multiple exposures to coriander volatile oil can be useful as a mean to counteract anxiety, depression and oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease conditions.

24747528|t|Pharmacological chaperones stabilize retromer to limit APP processing.
24747528|a|Retromer is a multiprotein complex that trafficks cargo out of endosomes. The neuronal retromer traffics the amyloid-precursor protein (APP) away from endosomes, a site where APP is cleaved into pathogenic fragments in Alzheimer's disease. Here we determined whether pharmacological chaperones can enhance retromer stability and function. First, we relied on the crystal structures of retromer proteins to help identify the 'weak link' of the complex and to complete an in silico screen of small molecules predicted to enhance retromer stability. Among the hits, an in vitro assay identified one molecule that stabilized retromer against thermal denaturation. Second, we turned to cultured hippocampal neurons, showing that this small molecule increases the levels of retromer proteins, shifts APP away from the endosome, and decreases the pathogenic processing of APP. These findings show that pharmacological chaperones can enhance the function of a multiprotein complex and may have potential therapeutic implications for neurodegenerative diseases.

24748561|t|Interneurons, tau and amyloid-beta in the piriform cortex in Alzheimer's disease.
24748561|a|Impaired olfaction has been described as an early symptom of Alzheimer's disease. Neuroanatomical changes underlying this deficit in the olfactory system are largely unknown. Interestingly, neuropathology begins in the transentorhinal cortex and extends to the neighboring limbic system and basal telencephalic structures that mediate olfactory processing, including the anterior olfactory nucleus and olfactory bulb. The human piriform cortex has been described as a crucial area in odor quality coding; disruption of this region mediates early olfactory deficits in Alzheimer's disease. Most neuropathological investigations have focused on the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, whereas the piriform cortex has largely been neglected. This work aims to characterize the expression of the neuropathological amyloid-beta peptide, tau protein and interneuron population markers (calretinin, parvalbumin and somatostatin) in the piriform cortex of ten Alzheimer-diagnosed (80.4 +- 8.3 years old) and five control (69.6 +- 11.1) cases. Here, we examined the distribution of different interneuronal markers as well as co-localization of interneurons and pathological markers. Results indicated preferential vulnerability of somatostatin- (p = 0.0001 < alpha = 0.05) and calretinin-positive (p = 0.013 < alpha = 0.05) cells that colocalized with amyloid-beta peptide, while the prevalence of parvalbumin-positive cells was increased (p = 0.045 < alpha = 0.05) in the Alzheimer's cases. These data may help to reveal the neural basis of olfactory deficits linked to Alzheimer's disease as well as to characterize neuronal populations preferentially vulnerable to neuropathology in regions critically involved in early stages of the disease.

24748671|t|CSF Abeta42 predicts early-onset dementia in Parkinson disease.
24748671|a|OBJECTIVE: To test in vivo the proposal from clinicopathologic studies that beta-amyloid (Abeta) pathology shortens the time to dementia in Parkinson disease (PD), and to explore the utility of CSF Abeta and related measures as early prognostic biomarkers of dementia in an incident PD cohort. METHODS: We assessed a population-based incident cohort of 104 patients with PD who underwent lumbar puncture at diagnosis. We analyzed CSF concentrations of Abeta42, Abeta40, and Abeta38 using a multiplexed immunoassay with electrochemiluminescence (ECL) detection and levels of Abeta42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau using ELISA. Patients were followed prospectively for 5 years. Dementia was diagnosed according to published criteria. RESULTS: CSF levels of Abeta42 were significantly decreased in patients who developed dementia (n = 20, 19.2%) compared to those who did not (n = 84, 80.8%), as measured by ECL (-33%, p = 0.006) as well as ELISA (-36%, p < 0.001). No differences were observed for other markers. Low Abeta42 values predicted a substantially increased risk for subsequent dementia at high sensitivity (>= 85%), with hazard ratios of 9.9 (95% confidence interval 2.3-43.5, p = 0.002) for Abeta42ECL <376 pg/mL and 7.6 (2.2-26.4, p = 0.001) for Abeta42ELISA <443 pg/mL, after adjustment for baseline age and PD-mild cognitive impairment (MCI) status. Abeta42 reductions tended to precede the onset of PD-MCI that progressed to dementia. CONCLUSIONS: These in vivo data support the role of Abeta pathology in the etiology and highlight the potential utility of CSF Abeta42 as an early prognostic biomarker of dementia associated with PD.

24748672|t|Long-term effects of amyloid, hypometabolism, and atrophy on neuropsychological functions.
24748672|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess how amyloid deposition, glucose hypometabolism, and cerebral atrophy affect neuropsychological performance in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and controls over time. METHODS: A total of 41 patients with AD dementia, 28 patients with MCI, and 19 controls underwent [(11)C]-Pittsburgh compound B ((11)C-PiB) and [(18)F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose ((18)F-FDG)-PET and MRI scans at baseline. We extracted global binding potential for (11)C-PiB, the number of abnormal voxels for (18)F-FDG, and gray matter volumes using SIENAX for MRI as measures of amyloid, hypometabolism, and atrophy. In addition, repeat neuropsychological testing was performed, including memory, attention, language, and executive tasks (mean follow-up 2.2 +- 0.7 years). Cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between imaging markers and cognition were assessed using linear mixed models, including terms for the imaging markers, time, sex, age, diagnosis, and interactions for imaging marker x time and imaging marker x time x diagnosis. RESULTS: Linear mixed models showed that baseline hypometabolism and atrophy were associated with poorer baseline performance on attention and executive functions (p < 0.05), whereas amyloid was not related to baseline cognition. Hypometabolism and amyloid were strongly associated with longitudinal decline in essentially all cognitive domains (pinteraction < 0.05), whereas atrophy was related specifically to future decline in Mini-Mental State Examination and memory (pinteraction < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Glucose hypometabolism and brain atrophy were associated with concurrent cognitive function, whereas brain amyloid was not. Amyloid deposition and glucose hypometabolism were predictors for decline of a wide variety of cognitive functions, while brain atrophy specifically predicted memory deterioration.

24748674|t|Amyloid and APOE epsilon4 interact to influence short-term decline in preclinical Alzheimer disease.
24748674|a|OBJECTIVE: To examine whether beta-amyloid (Abeta) and APOE epsilon4 status independently contribute or interact to influence longitudinal cognitive decline in clinically normal older individuals (CN). METHODS: Data from 490 CNs were aggregated across 3 observational cohort studies (Harvard Aging Brain Study, Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, and Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle Study of Ageing; median age = 75.0 years, 255 female), and the contributions of APOE epsilon4 and Abeta on longitudinal change over a median of 1.49 years were examined. Cognitive decline was assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Logical Memory (immediate and delayed recall scores). RESULTS: High Abeta participants were more likely to be APOE epsilon4+ than low Abeta participants. CNs who were both high Abeta and APOE epsilon4+ showed greater decline in Logical Memory immediate recall (p < 0.087), Logical Memory delayed recall (p < 0.024), and MMSE (p < 0.034) compared to all other groups (low Abeta/APOE epsilon4-, low Abeta/APOE epsilon4+, and high Abeta/APOE epsilon4-). No other pairwise contrast was significant for any cognitive measure. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically normal individuals who are APOE epsilon4+ and have high Abeta showed the highest cognitive decline. These results suggest that Abeta and APOE epsilon4 are not redundant contributors of decline in aging but rather interact to promote decline during the short follow-up period examined in this study. Longer follow-up periods will be essential to fully elucidate the influence of Alzheimer disease risk factors on cognitive decline in aging.

24750033|t|Endogenous polyamines reduce the toxicity of soluble abeta peptide aggregates associated with Alzheimer's disease.
24750033|a|Polyamines promote the formation of the Abeta peptide amyloid fibers that are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Here we show that polyamines interact with nonaggregated Abeta peptides, thereby reducing the peptide's hydrophobic surface. We characterized the associated conformational change through NMR titrations and molecular dynamics simulations. We found that even low concentrations of spermine, sperimidine, and putrescine fully protected SH-SY5Y (a neuronal cell model) against the most toxic conformational species of Abeta, even at an Abeta oligomer concentration that would otherwise kill half of the cells or even more. These observations lead us to conclude that polyamines interfere with the more toxic prefibrillar conformations and might protect cells by promoting the structural transition of Abeta toward its less toxic fibrillar state that we reported previously. Since polyamines are present in brain fluid at the concentrations where we observed all these effects, their activity needs to be taken into account in understanding the molecular processes related to the development of Alzheimer's disease.

24751138|t|Structure-activity relationships for a series of compounds that inhibit aggregation of the Alzheimer's peptide, Abeta42.
24751138|a|Inhibiting aggregation of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide may be an effective strategy for combating Alzheimer's disease. As the high-resolution structure of the toxic Abeta aggregate is unknown, rational design of small molecule inhibitors is not possible, and inhibitors are best isolated by high-throughput screening. We applied high-throughput screening to a collection of 65,000 compounds to identify compound D737 as an inhibitor of Abeta aggregation. D737 diminished the formation of oligomers and fibrils, and reduced Abeta42-induced cytotoxicity. Most importantly, D737 increased the life span and locomotive ability of transgenic flies in a Drosophila melanogaster model of Alzheimer's disease (J Biol Chem, 287, 2012, 38992). To explore the chemical features that make D737 an effective inhibitor of Abeta42 aggregation and toxicity, we tested a small collection of eleven analogues of D737. Overall, the ability of a compound to inhibit Abeta aggregation was a good predictor of its efficacy in prolonging the life span and locomotive ability of transgenic flies expressing human Abeta42 in the central nervous system. Two compounds (D744 and D830) with fluorine substitutions on an aromatic ring were effective inhibitors of Abeta42 aggregation and increased the longevity of transgenic flies beyond that observed for the parent compound, D737.

24753106|t|Nrf2 regulates neurogenesis and protects neural progenitor cells against Abeta toxicity.
24753106|a|Neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs) proliferate and produce new neurons in neurogenic areas throughout the lifetime. While these cells represent potential therapeutic treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, regulation of neurogenesis is not completely understood. We show that deficiency of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2), a transcription factor induced in response to oxidative stress, prevents the ischemia-induced increase in newborn neurons in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. Consistent with this finding, the growth of NPC neurospheres was increased by lentivirus-mediated overexpression of Nrf2 gene or by treatment with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), an Nrf2 activating compound. Also, neuronal differentiation of NPCs was increased by Nrf2 overexpression or PDTC treatment but reduced by Nrf2 deficiency. To investigate the impact of Nrf2 on NPCs in Alzheimer's disease (AD), we treated NPCs with amyloid beta (Abeta), a toxic peptide associated with neurodegeneration and cognitive abnormalities in AD. We found that Abeta1-42-induced toxicity and reduction in neurosphere proliferation were prevented by Nrf2 overexpression, while Nrf2 deficiency enhanced the Abeta1-42-induced reduction of neuronal differentiation. On the other hand, Abeta1-40 had no effect on neurosphere proliferation in wt NPCs but increased the proliferation of Nrf2 overexpressing neurospheres and reduced it in Nrf2-deficient neurospheres. These results suggest that Nrf2 is essential for neuronal differentiation of NPCs, regulates injury-induced neurogenesis and provides protection against Abeta-induced NPC toxicity.

24753305|t|Structural evolution and membrane interactions of Alzheimer's amyloid-beta peptide oligomers: new knowledge from single-molecule fluorescence studies.
24753305|a|Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) oligomers may represent the proximal neurotoxin in Alzheimer's disease. Single-molecule microscopy (SMM) techniques have recently emerged as a method for overcoming the innate difficulties of working with amyloid-beta, including the peptide's low endogenous concentrations, the dynamic nature of its oligomeric states, and its heterogeneous and complex membrane interactions. SMM techniques have revealed that small oligomers of the peptide bind to model membranes and cells at low nanomolar-to-picomolar concentrations and diffuse at rates dependent on the membrane characteristics. These methods have also shown that oligomers grow or dissociate based on the presence of specific inhibitors or promoters and on the ratio of Abeta40 to Abeta42. Here, we discuss several types of single-molecule imaging that have been applied to the study of Abeta oligomers and their membrane interactions. We also summarize some of the recent insights SMM has provided into oligomer behavior in solution, on planar lipid membranes, and on living cell membranes. A brief overview of the current limitations of the technique, including the lack of sensitive assays for Abeta-induced toxicity, is included in hopes of inspiring future development in this area of research.

24756381|t|Cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and cognitive function in people without cognitive impairment from across the adult life span.
24756381|a|IMPORTANCE: Age-related cognitive decline among older individuals with normal cognition is a complex trait that potentially derives from processes of aging, inherited vulnerabilities, environmental factors, and common latent diseases that can progress to cause dementia, such as Alzheimer disease and vascular brain injury. OBJECTIVE: To use cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers to gain insight into this complex trait. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Secondary analyses of an academic multicenter cross-sectional (n = 315) and longitudinal (n = 158) study of 5 neuropsychological tests (Immediate Recall, Delayed Recall, Trail Making Test Parts A and B, and Category Fluency) in cognitively normal individuals aged 21 to 100 years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: To investigate the association of these cognitive function test results with age, sex, educational level, inheritance of the epsilon4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene, and CSF concentrations of beta-amyloid 42 (Abeta42) and tau (biomarkers of Alzheimer disease) as well as F2-isoprostanes (measures of free radical injury). RESULTS: Age and educational level were broadly predictive of cross-sectional cognitive performance; of the genetic and CSF measures, only greater CSF F2-isoprostane concentration was significantly associated with poorer executive function (adjusted R2 <=0.31). Longitudinal measures of cognitive abilities, except Category Fluency, also were associated broadly with age; of the genetic and CSF measures, only lower baseline CSF Abeta42 concentration was associated with longitudinal measures of immediate and delayed recall (marginal R2 <=0.31). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our results suggest that age and educational level accounted for a substantial minority of variance in cross-sectional or longitudinal cognitive test performance in this large group of cognitively normal adults. Latent Alzheimer disease and other diseases that produce free radical injury, such as vascular brain injury, accounted for a small amount of variation in cognitive test performance across the adult human life span. Additional genetic and environmental factors likely contribute substantially to age-related cognitive decline.

24756858|t|Significant structural differences between transient amyloid-beta oligomers and less-toxic fibrils in regions known to harbor familial Alzheimer's mutations.
24756858|a|Small oligomers of the amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide, rather than the monomers or the fibrils, are suspected to initiate Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, their low concentration and transient nature under physiological conditions have made structural investigations difficult. A method for addressing such problems has been developed by combining rapid fluorescence techniques with slower two-dimensional solid-state NMR methods. The smallest Abeta40 oligomers that demonstrate a potential sign of toxicity, namely, an enhanced affinity for cell membranes, were thus probed. The two hydrophobic regions (residues 10-21 and 30-40) have already attained the conformation that is observed in the fibrils. However, the turn region (residues 22-29) and the N-terminal tail (residues 1-9) are strikingly different. Notably, ten of eleven known Abeta mutants that are linked to familial AD map to these two regions. Our results provide potential structural cues for AD therapeutics and also suggest a general method for determining transient protein structures.

24758520|t|Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG)-stabilized selenium nanoparticles coated with Tet-1 peptide to reduce amyloid-beta aggregation and cytotoxicity.
24758520|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disease, is caused by an accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaque deposits in the brains. Evidence is increasingly showing that epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) can partly protect cells from Abeta-mediated neurotoxicity by inhibiting Abeta aggregation. In order to better understand the process of Abeta aggregation and amyloid fibril disaggregation and reduce the cytotoxicity of EGCG at high doses, we attached EGCG onto the surface of selenium nanoparticles (EGCG@Se). Given the low delivery efficiency of EGCG@Se to the targeted cells and the involvement of selenoprotein in antioxidation and neuroprotection, which are the key factors for preventing the onset and progression of AD, we synthesized EGCG-stabilized selenium nanoparticles coated with Tet-1 peptide (Tet-1-EGCG@Se, a synthetic selenoprotein analogue), considering the affinity of Tet-1 peptide to neurons. We revealed that Tet-1-EGCG@Se can effectively inhibit Abeta fibrillation and disaggregate preformed Abeta fibrils into nontoxic aggregates. In addition, we found that both EGCG@Se and Tet-1-EGCG@Se can label Abeta fibrils with a high affinity, and Tet-1 peptides can significantly enhance the cellular uptake of Tet-1-EGCG@Se in PC12 cells rather than in NIH/3T3 cells.

24759555|t|Exercise-induced wheezing among Japanese pre-school children and pupils.
24759555|a|BACKGROUND: Exercise-induced wheezing (EIW) may be a symptom of asthma and is a predictor of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, transient narrowing of the lower airway following exercise in the presence or absence of diagnosed asthma. Population-based studies with a large sample of EIW in relation to age, sex, current asthma severity and medication usage have been sparse. METHODS: International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaires were distributed at 885 nurseries, 535 primary schools, 321 junior high schools and 190 high schools, respectively, across Japan, and the corresponding data on 46,597, 41,216, 45,960 and 51,104 children were analyzed. RESULTS: Prevalence of EIW was 4.8, 4.7, 17.9 and 15.4% for each of the four educational facility types, respectively. Among 24,103 current asthmatics, 20.9, 28.7, 76.1 and 73.6% of subjects for the 4 educational facility groups reported to have experienced EIW, respectively. Severity of current asthma was associated with the risk of EIW; odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of children with asthma attack every day for having EIW once a week or more, using intermittent asthmatics as reference group, were 24.48 (19.33 to 31.01) adjusted for other covariates. Among current asthmatic kindergartners, increase in risk for EIW due to ascending severity of current asthma was mitigated by daily use of leukotriene receptor antagonist (p for interaction = 0.071). CONCLUSIONS: EIW was not rare among current asthmatic children. An increased risk for EIW was in accordance with increasing severity of current asthma and this relation was mitigated with leukotriene receptor antagonist daily use among kindergartners.

24760020|t|Amyloid-beta and proinflammatory cytokines utilize a prion protein-dependent pathway to activate NADPH oxidase and induce cofilin-actin rods in hippocampal neurons.
24760020|a|Neurites of neurons under acute or chronic stress form bundles of filaments (rods) containing 1:1 cofilin:actin, which impair transport and synaptic function. Rods contain disulfide cross-linked cofilin and are induced by treatments resulting in oxidative stress. Rods form rapidly (5-30 min) in >80% of cultured hippocampal or cortical neurons treated with excitotoxic levels of glutamate or energy depleted (hypoxia/ischemia or mitochondrial inhibitors). In contrast, slow rod formation (50% of maximum response in ~6 h) occurs in a subpopulation (~20%) of hippocampal neurons upon exposure to soluble human amyloid-beta dimer/trimer (Abetad/t) at subnanomolar concentrations. Here we show that proinflammatory cytokines (TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-6) also induce rods at the same rate and within the same neuronal population as Abetad/t. Neurons from prion (PrP(C))-null mice form rods in response to glutamate or antimycin A, but not in response to proinflammatory cytokines or Abetad/t. Two pathways inducing rod formation were confirmed by demonstrating that NADPH-oxidase (NOX) activity is required for prion-dependent rod formation, but not for rods induced by glutamate or energy depletion. Surprisingly, overexpression of PrP(C) is by itself sufficient to induce rods in over 40% of hippocampal neurons through the NOX-dependent pathway. Persistence of PrP(C)-dependent rods requires the continuous activity of NOX. Removing inducers or inhibiting NOX activity in cells containing PrP(C)-dependent rods causes rod disappearance with a half-life of about 36 min. Cofilin-actin rods provide a mechanism for synapse loss bridging the amyloid and cytokine hypotheses for Alzheimer disease, and may explain how functionally diverse Abeta-binding membrane proteins induce synaptic dysfunction.

24760838|t|Crtc1 activates a transcriptional program deregulated at early Alzheimer's disease-related stages.
24760838|a|Cognitive decline is associated with gene expression changes in the brain, but the transcriptional mechanisms underlying memory impairments in cognitive disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), are largely unknown. Here, we aimed to elucidate relevant mechanisms responsible for transcriptional changes underlying early memory loss in AD by examining pathological, behavioral, and transcriptomic changes in control and mutant beta-amyloid precursor protein (APPSw,Ind) transgenic mice during aging. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis using mouse microarrays revealed deregulation of a gene network related with neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity, and learning/memory in the hippocampus of APPSw,Ind mice after spatial memory training. Specifically, APPSw,Ind mice show changes on a cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB)-regulated transcriptional program dependent on the CREB-regulated transcription coactivator-1 (Crtc1). Interestingly, synaptic activity and spatial memory induces Crtc1 dephosphorylation (Ser151), nuclear translocation, and Crtc1-dependent transcription in the hippocampus, and these events are impaired in APPSw,Ind mice at early pathological and cognitive decline stages. CRTC1-dependent genes and CRTC1 levels are reduced in human hippocampus at intermediate Braak III/IV pathological stages. Importantly, adeno-associated viral-mediated Crtc1 overexpression in the hippocampus efficiently reverses Abeta-induced spatial learning and memory deficits by restoring a specific subset of Crtc1 target genes. Our results reveal a critical role of Crtc1-dependent transcription on spatial memory formation and provide the first evidence that targeting brain transcriptome reverses memory loss in AD.

24760868|t|Activity-dependent tau protein translocation to excitatory synapse is disrupted by exposure to amyloid-beta oligomers.
24760868|a|Tau is a microtubule-associated protein well known for its stabilization of microtubules in axons. Recently, it has emerged that tau participates in synaptic function as part of the molecular pathway leading to amyloid-beta (Abeta)-driven synaptotoxicity in the context of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we report the implication of tau in the profound functional synaptic modification associated with synaptic plasticity. By exposing murine cultured cortical neurons to a pharmacological synaptic activation, we induced translocation of endogenous tau from the dendritic to the postsynaptic compartment. We observed similar tau translocation to the postsynaptic fraction in acute hippocampal slices subjected to long-term potentiation. When we performed live confocal microscopy on cortical neurons transfected with human-tau-GFP, we visualized an activity-dependent accumulation of tau in the postsynaptic density. Coprecipitation using phalloidin revealed that tau interacts with the most predominant cytoskeletal component present, filamentous actin. Finally, when we exposed cortical cultures to 100 nm human synthetic Abeta oligomers (Abetao's) for 15 min, we induced mislocalization of tau into the spines under resting conditions and abrogated subsequent activity-dependent synaptic tau translocation. These changes in synaptic tau dynamics may rely on a difference between physiological and pathological phosphorylation of tau. Together, these results suggest that intense synaptic activity drives tau to the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses and that Abetao-driven tau translocation to the spine deserves further investigation as a key event toward synaptotoxicity in neurodegenerative diseases.

24762947|t|Design of multi-target compounds as AChE, BACE1, and amyloid-beta(1-42) oligomerization inhibitors: in silico and in vitro studies.
24762947|a|Despite great efforts to develop new therapeutic strategies against Alzheimer's disease (AD), the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs): donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine, have been used only as a palliative therapeutic approach. However, the pathogenesis of AD includes several factors such as cholinergic hypothesis, amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregation, and oxidative stress. For this reason, the design of compounds that target the genesis and progression of AD could offer a therapeutic benefit. We have designed a set of compounds (M-1 to M-5) with pharmacophore moieties to inhibit the release, aggregation, or toxicity of Abeta, act as AChEIs and have antioxidant properties. Once the compounds were designed, we analyzed their physicochemical parameters and performed docking studies to determine their affinity values for AChE, beta-site amyloid-protein precursor cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), and the Abeta monomer. The best ligands, M-1 and M-4, were then synthesized, chemically characterized, and evaluated in vitro. The in vitro studies showed that these compounds inhibit AChE (M-1 Ki = 0.12 and M-4 Ki = 0.17 muM) and BACE1 (M-1 IC50 = 15.1 and M-4 IC50 = 15.4 nM). They also inhibit Abeta oligomerization and exhibit antioxidant activity. In addition, these compounds showed low cytotoxicity in microglial cells. For these reasons, they are promising for future use as drugs in AD mice transgenic models.

24763698|t|Mapping amyloid-beta(16-22) nucleation pathways using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy.
24763698|a|The cross-beta peptide architecture is associated with numerous functional biomaterials and deleterious disease related aggregates. While these diverse and ubiquitous paracrystalline assemblies have been widely studied, a fundamental understanding of the nucleation and aggregation pathways to these structures remains elusive. Here we highlight a novel application of fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy in characterising the critical stages of peptide aggregation. Using the central nucleating core of the amyloid-beta (Abeta), Abeta(16-22), as a model cross-beta system, and utilising a small fraction of rhodamine labelled peptide (Rh110-Abeta(17-22)), we map out a folding pathway from monomer to paracrystalline nanotube. Using this intrinsic fluorescence reporter, we demonstrate the effects of interfaces and evaporation on the nucleation of sub-critical concentration solutions, providing access to previously uncharacterised intermediate morphologies. Using fluorescence lifetime we follow the local peptide environment through the stages of nucleation and hydrophobic collapse, ending in a stable final structure. This work provides a metric for future implementations of measuring fluorescence lifetimes of intrinsic fluorescence reporters during the very dynamic processes relating to peptide nucleation and maturation.

24766537|t|Defining the limits: Protein aggregation and toxicity in vivo.
24766537|a|Abstract others complementary, to resolve mis-folded proteins when they arise, ranging from refolding through the action of molecular chaperones to elimination through regulated proteolytic mechanisms. These protein quality control pathways are sufficient, under normal conditions, to maintain a functioning proteome, but in response to diverse environmental, genetic and/or stochastic events, protein mis-folding exceeds the corrective capacity of these pathways, leading to the accumulation of aggregates and ultimately toxicity. Particularly devastating examples of these effects include certain neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington's Disease, which are associated with the expansion of polyglutamine tracks in proteins. In these cases, protein mis-folding and aggregation are clear contributors to pathogenesis, but uncovering the precise mechanistic links between the two events remains an area of active research. Studies in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other model systems have uncovered previously unanticipated complexity in aggregation pathways, the contributions of protein quality control processes to them and the cellular perturbations that result from them. Together these studies suggest that aggregate interactions and localization, rather than their size, are the crucial considerations in understanding the molecular basis of toxicity.

24766729|t|Is formaldehyde the missing link in AD pathology? The differential aggregation of amyloid-beta with APOE isoforms in vitro.
24766729|a|Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genetic variation and aging are the two most noted risk factors associated with the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) related dementia. However, the relationship between these two pathological factors is not understood. Formaldehyde (FA) is an age related factor that has been found to be elevated in AD patients and is known to have protein cross-linking properties. FA forms cross-links with larger arginine, lysine and tryptophan residues but also has thiol reactivity. This study investigated the formation of protein aggregates between amyloid-beta (1-40) peptide (Abeta), the main component of amyloid plaques in AD, with APOE isoforms in vitro. APOE4 protein, the isoform with arginines at residue 112 and 158, was found to form aggregates with more Abeta (P < 0.001) and APOE (P < 0.05) protein content in 10 mM FA than aggregates formed with either APOE3 or APOE2 protein. This aggregation pattern reflected the trend of vulnerability conferred by the APOE genetic variation (APOE4 > APOE3 > APOE2) and suggested that FA may have a role in the differential pattern of amyloid plaque formation in people with differing APOE genetic backgrounds. All told, this finding adds to a growing body of evidence that FA has a role in AD progression as well as provides a novel link between aging and APOE risk factors; the cornerstones of one of the world's largest mental health concerns.

24767990|t|Coreleased orexin and glutamate evoke nonredundant spike outputs and computations in histamine neurons.
24767990|a|Stable wakefulness requires orexin/hypocretin neurons (OHNs) and OHR2 receptors. OHNs sense diverse environmental cues and control arousal accordingly. For unknown reasons, OHNs contain multiple excitatory transmitters, including OH peptides and glutamate. To analyze their cotransmission within computational frameworks for control, we optogenetically stimulated OHNs and examined resulting outputs (spike patterns) in a downstream arousal regulator, the histamine neurons (HANs). OHR2s were essential for sustained HAN outputs. OHR2-dependent HAN output increased linearly during constant OHN input, suggesting that the OHN HAN(OHR2) module may function as an integral controller. OHN stimulation evoked OHR2-dependent slow postsynaptic currents, similar to midnanomolar OH concentrations. Conversely, glutamate-dependent output transiently communicated OHN input onset, peaking rapidly then decaying alongside OHN HAN glutamate currents. Blocking glutamate-driven spiking did not affect OH-driven spiking and vice versa, suggesting isolation (low cross-modulation) of outputs. Therefore, in arousal regulators, cotransmitters may translate distinct features of OHN activity into parallel, nonredundant control signals for downstream effectors.

24768341|t|Alzheimer's disease biomarker discovery using SOMAscan multiplexed protein technology.
24768341|a|Blood proteins and their complexes have become the focus of a great deal of interest in the context of their potential as biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We used a SOMAscan assay for quantifying 1001 proteins in blood samples from 331 AD, 211 controls, and 149 mild cognitive impaired (MCI) subjects. The strongest associations of protein levels with AD outcomes were prostate-specific antigen complexed to alpha1-antichymotrypsin (AD diagnosis), pancreatic prohormone (AD diagnosis, left entorhinal cortex atrophy, and left hippocampus atrophy), clusterin (rate of cognitive decline), and fetuin B (left entorhinal atrophy). Multivariate analysis found that a subset of 13 proteins predicted AD with an accuracy of area under the curve of 0.70. Our replication of previous findings provides further evidence that levels of these proteins in plasma are truly associated with AD. The newly identified proteins could be potential biomarkers and are worthy of further investigation.

24769014|t|Lenalidomide maintenance for high-risk multiple myeloma after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation.
24769014|a|Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) with reduced-intensity conditioning is an appealing option for patients with high-risk multiple myeloma (MM). However, progression after alloHCT remains a challenge. Maintenance therapy after alloHCT may offer additional disease control and allow time for a graft-versus-myeloma effect. The primary objective of this clinical trial was to determine the tolerability and safety profile of maintenance lenalidomide (LEN) given on days 1 to 21 of 28 days cycles, with intrapatient dose escalation during 12 months/cycles after alloHCT. Thirty alloHCT recipients (median age, 54 years) with high-risk MM were enrolled at 8 centers between 2009 and 2012. The median time from alloHCT to LEN initiation was 96 days (range, 66 to 171 days). Eleven patients (37%) completed maintenance and 10 mg daily was the most commonly delivered dose (44%). Most common reasons for discontinuation were acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (37%) and disease progression (37%). Cumulative incidence of grades III to IV acute GVHD from time of initiation of LEN was 17%. Outcomes at 18 months after initiation of maintenance were MM progression, 28%; transplantation-related mortality, 11%; and progression-free and overall survival, 63% and 78%, respectively. The use of LEN after alloHCT is feasible at lower doses, although it is associated with a 38% incidence of acute GVHD. Survival outcomes observed in this high-risk MM population warrant further study of this approach.

24769158|t|Fibrillation of beta amyloid peptides in the presence of phospholipid bilayers and the consequent membrane disruption.
24769158|a|Fibrillation of beta amyloid (Abeta) peptides and the accumulation of amyloid plaques are considered as an important clinical hallmark to identify Alzheimer's disease (AD). The physiological connection between Abeta plaques and the disruption of neuronal cells has not been clearly understood. One hypothesis to explain the Abeta neurotoxicity is that the fibrillation process induces disruption to the cellular membrane. We studied the Abeta fibrillation process in two biologically relevant conditions with the peptide either pre-incorporated into or externally added to the synthetic phospholipid bilayers. These two sample preparation conditions mimic the physiological membrane proximities of Abeta peptides before and after the enzymatic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Using thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we were able to monitor the kinetics and morphological evolution of fibril formation, which was highly sensitive to the two sample preparation protocols. While the external addition protocol generates long and mature fibrils through normal fibrillation process, the pre-incubation protocol was found to stabilize the immature protofibrils. Fluorescence spectroscopy studies with doubly-labeled phospholipids indicated that there may be a lipid uptake process associated with the fibril formation. Solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy provided evidence for high resolution structural variations in fibrils formed with different protocols, and in particular the stabilization of long-range contact between N- and C-terminal beta strands. In addition, disruption of phospholipid bilayers was supported by measurements with 31P chemical shifts and relaxation time constants.

24769478|t|Simultaneous measurement of a range of particle sizes during Abeta1-42 fibrillogenesis quantified using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy.
24769478|a|Low molecular weight oligomers of amyloid beta (Abeta) are important drivers of Alzheimer's disease. A decrease in Abeta monomer levels in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is observed in Alzheimers' patients and is a robust biomarker of the disease. It has been suggested that the decrease in monomer levels in CSF is due to the formation of Abeta oligomers. A robust technique capable of identifying Abeta oligomers in CSF is therefore desirable. We have used fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and a five Gaussian distribution model (5GDM) to monitor the aggregation of Abeta1-42 in sodium phosphate buffer and in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF). In buffer, several different sized components (monomer, oligomers, protofibrils and fibrils) can be identified simultaneously using 5GDM. In ACSF, the faster kinetics of fibrillogenesis leads to the formation of fibrils on very short timescales. This analysis method can also be used to monitor the aggregation of other proteins, nanoparticles or colloids, even in complex biological fluids.

24771519|t|Within-patient correspondence of amyloid-beta and intrinsic network connectivity in Alzheimer's disease.
24771519|a|There is striking overlap between the spatial distribution of amyloid-beta pathology in patients with Alzheimer's disease and the spatial distribution of high intrinsic functional connectivity in healthy persons. This overlap suggests a mechanistic link between amyloid-beta and intrinsic connectivity, and indeed there is evidence in patients for the detrimental effects of amyloid-beta plaque accumulation on intrinsic connectivity in areas of high connectivity in heteromodal hubs, and particularly in the default mode network. However, the observed spatial extent of amyloid-beta exceeds these tightly circumscribed areas, suggesting that previous studies may have underestimated the negative impact of amyloid-beta on intrinsic connectivity. We hypothesized that the known positive baseline correlation between patterns of amyloid-beta and intrinsic connectivity may mask the larger extent of the negative effects of amyloid-beta on connectivity. Crucially, a test of this hypothesis requires the within-patient comparison of intrinsic connectivity and amyloid-beta distributions. Here we compared spatial patterns of amyloid-beta-plaques (measured by Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography) and intrinsic functional connectivity (measured by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging) in patients with prodromal Alzheimer's disease via spatial correlations in intrinsic networks covering fronto-parietal heteromodal cortices. At the global network level, we found that amyloid-beta and intrinsic connectivity patterns were positively correlated in the default mode and several fronto-parietal attention networks, confirming that amyloid-beta aggregates in areas of high intrinsic connectivity on a within-network basis. Further, we saw an internetwork gradient of the magnitude of correlation that depended on network plaque-load. After accounting for this globally positive correlation, local amyloid-beta-plaque concentration in regions of high connectivity co-varied negatively with intrinsic connectivity, indicating that amyloid-beta pathology adversely reduces connectivity anywhere in an affected network as a function of local amyloid-beta-plaque concentration. The local negative association between amyloid-beta and intrinsic connectivity was much more pronounced than conventional group comparisons of intrinsic connectivity would suggest. Our findings indicate that the negative impact of amyloid-beta on intrinsic connectivity in heteromodal networks is underestimated by conventional analyses. Moreover, our results provide first within-patient evidence for correspondent patterns of amyloid-beta and intrinsic connectivity, with the distribution of amyloid-beta pathology following functional connectivity gradients within and across intrinsic networks.

24773532|t|The C-terminal threonine of Abeta43 nucleates toxic aggregation via structural and dynamical changes in monomers and protofibrils.
24773532|a|Recent studies suggest that deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) into oligomeric aggregates and fibrils, hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, may be initiated by the aggregation of Abeta species other than the well-studied 40- and 42-residue forms, Abeta40 and Abeta42, respectively. Here we report on key structural, dynamic, and aggregation kinetic parameters of Abeta43, extended by a single threonine at the C-terminus relative to Abeta42. Using aggregation time course experiments, electron microscopy, and a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance measurements including backbone relaxation, dark-state exchange saturation transfer, and quantification of chemical shift differences and scalar coupling constants, we demonstrate that the C-terminal threonine in Abeta43 increases the rate and extent of protofibril aggregation and confers slow C-terminal motions in the monomeric and protofibril-bound forms of Abeta43. Relative to the neighboring residues, the hydrophilic Thr43 of Abeta43 favors direct contact with the protofibril surface more so than the C-terminus of Abeta40 or Abeta42. Taken together, these results demonstrate the potential of a small chemical modification to affect the properties of Abeta structure and aggregation, providing a mechanism for the potential role of Abeta43 as a primary nucleator of Abeta aggregates in Alzheimer's disease.

24773698|t|Duration between onset and diagnosis in central nervous system tumors: impact on prognosis and functional outcome.
24773698|a|BACKGROUND: The initial presentation of central nervous system (CNS) tumors in children frequently mimics other more common and less serious conditions, resulting in diagnostic difficulty and a prolonged time to diagnosis. Yet whether early diagnosis contributes to better life prognosis and functional outcome has not been elucidated. Only a few such reports have originated from Japan, where neuroimaging techniques are the best in the world. We examined the time to diagnosis, the so-called prediagnostic symptomatic interval (PSI), and its impact on prognosis and functional outcome in children with CNS tumors. METHODS: We reviewed the records of 127 patients aged <15 years with CNS tumors, who were treated at our two institutions between November 1993 and October 2011. RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis was 7.2 years (range, 3 weeks-14.9 years). The male-to-female ratio was 63:64. Median PSI was 1.5 months (0-36 months). Overall survival and progression-free survival did not differ significantly between the groups, regardless of whether the PSI was longer than the median PSI. The PSI was significantly longer in patients with long-lasting clinical signs after the initial treatment than in patients with temporary symptoms only at onset. Both univariate and multivariate analysis showed that high histological grading was statistically correlated with short PSI. CONCLUSIONS: A short PSI was significantly associated with high-grade tumors. Earlier diagnosis did not lead to better life prognosis, but possibly to better functional outcome in children with CNS tumors.

24779910|t|Senile plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy in an aged California sea lion (Zalophus californianus).
24779910|a|Senile plaques (SPs) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) consisting of beta-amyloid (Abeta) are major features in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and elderly humans and animals. In this study, we report the finding of SPs and CAA in an aged sea lion (30 years), which is the first demonstration of AD-related pathological changes in a marine animal. Histologically, SPs were observed at the cerebral cortex, most frequently at the frontal lobe, with two morphologically different types: the small round type and the large granular type. Only the small round SPs were positive for Congo red staining. The SPs were equally immunoreactive to Abeta40 and Abeta42 and were mainly composed of Abeta with an N-terminal pyroglutamate residue at position 3. Amyloid depositions at vessel walls were noted at the meninges and within the parenchyma. Interestingly, double immunofluorescence staining for Abeta40 and Abeta42 showed that the two subtypes were deposited segmentally in different parts of the vessel walls. The lesions observed in the sea lion suggest that Abeta deposition is widely present in various animal species, including marine mammals; however, the peculiar deposits similar to cotton wool plaques and the specific pattern of CAA are characteristic features of this animal.

24780254|t|Beneficial effects of caffeine in a transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease-like tau pathology.
24780254|a|Tau pathology found in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial in cognitive decline. Epidemiologic evidences support that habitual caffeine intake prevents memory decline during aging and reduces the risk to develop Alzheimer's disease. So far, experimental studies addressed the impact of caffeine in models mimicking the amyloid pathology of AD. However, in vivo effects of caffeine in a model of AD-like tauopathy remain unknown. Here, we evaluated effects of chronic caffeine intake (0.3 g/L through drinking water), given at an early pathologic stage, in the THY-Tau22 transgenic mouse model of progressive AD-like tau pathology. We found that chronic caffeine intake prevents from the development of spatial memory deficits in tau mice. Improved memory was associated with reduced hippocampal tau phosphorylation and proteolytic fragments. Moreover, caffeine treatment mitigated several proinflammatory and oxidative stress markers found upregulated in the hippocampus of THY-Tau22 animals. Together, our data support that moderate caffeine intake is beneficial in a model of AD-like tau pathology, paving the way for future clinical evaluation in AD patients.

24781145|t|Emerging beta-amyloid pathology and accelerated cortical atrophy.
24781145|a|IMPORTANCE: The effect of beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation on regional structural brain changes in early stages of Alzheimer disease (AD) is not well understood. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that the development of Abeta pathology is related to increased regional atrophy in the brains of cognitively normal (CN) persons. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Longitudinal clinicobiomarker cohort study involving 47 CN control subjects and 15 patients with AD dementia. All participants underwent repeated cerebrospinal fluid Abeta42 and structural magnetic resonance imaging measurements for up to 4 years. Cognitively normal controls were classified using the longitudinal cerebrospinal fluid Abeta42 data and included 13 stable Abeta negative (normal baseline Abeta42 levels, with less than the median reduction over time), 13 declining Abeta negative (normal baseline Abeta42 levels, with greater than the median reduction over time), and 21 Abeta positive (pathologic baseline Abeta42 levels). All 15 patients with AD dementia were Abeta positive. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Group effects on regional gray matter volumes at baseline and over time, tested by linear mixed-effects models. RESULTS: Baseline gray matter volumes were similar among the CN Abeta groups, but atrophy rates were increased in frontoparietal regions in the declining Abeta-negative and Abeta-positive groups and in amygdala and temporal regions in the Abeta-positive group. Abeta-positive patients with AD dementia had further increased atrophy rates in hippocampus and temporal and cingulate regions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Emerging Abeta pathology is coupled to increased frontoparietal (but not temporal) atrophy rates. Atrophy rates peak early in frontoparietal regions but accelerate in hippocampus, temporal, and cingulate regions as the disease progresses to dementia. Early-stage Abeta pathology may have mild effects on local frontoparietal cortical integrity while effects in temporal regions appear later and accelerate, leading to the atrophy pattern typically seen in AD.

24784791|t|Electrochemical immunosensors for effective evaluation of amyloid-beta modulators on oligomeric and fibrillar aggregation processes.
24784791|a|A novel electrochemical immunosensor fabricated from gold compact disc electrodes was designed for rapid evaluation of aggregation processes that lead to the formation of oligomeric and fibrillar states of amyloid-beta(1-42) (Abeta(1-42)) during Alzheimer's disease. Conformation-specific antibodies were immobilized on the surface of the gold electrode using a 3,3'-dithiobis (sulfosuccinimidyl) propionate (DTSSP) linker. Surface binding events were analyzed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in which the formation of an antigen-antibody complex was quantified as a function of charge transfer resistance using a [Fe(CN)6](3-/4-) redox probe. The effectiveness of novel sym-triazine-derived aggregation modulators (TAE-1, TAE-2) to reduce the population of toxic oligomers was evaluated. Abeta fibril formation was validated by thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence, whereas oligomer formation was investigated by MALDI. Antigen detection by EIS was further supported by immuno dot blot assays for oligomeric and fibrillar components. Docking simulations of the aggregation modulators TAE-1 and TAE-2 with Abeta(1-42) fibrils performed using Autodock Vina suggest a mechanism for the improved aggregation inhibition observed for TAE-2. The results demonstrate the utility and convenience of impedance immunosensing as an analytical tool for rapid and comprehensive evaluation of effective Abeta aggregation modulating agents.

24785004|t|Abeta dimers differ from monomers in structural propensity, aggregation paths and population of synaptotoxic assemblies.
24785004|a|Dimers of Abeta (amyloid beta-protein) are believed to play an important role in Alzheimer's disease. In the absence of sufficient brain-derived dimers, we studied one of the only possible dimers that could be produced in vivo, [Abeta](DiY) (dityrosine cross-linked Abeta). For comparison, we used the Abeta monomer and a design dimer cross-linked by replacement of Ser26 with cystine [AbetaS26C]2. We showed that similar to monomers, unaggregated dimers lack appreciable structure and fail to alter long-term potentiation. Importantly, dimers exhibit subtly different structural propensities from monomers and each other, and can self-associate to form larger assemblies. Although [Abeta](DiY) and [AbetaS26C]2 have distinct aggregation pathways, they both populate bioactive soluble assemblies for longer durations than Abeta monomers. Our results indicate that the link between Abeta dimers and Alzheimer's disease results from the ability of dimers to further assemble and form synaptotoxic assemblies that persist for long periods of time.

24786080|a|To extend our understanding of the genetic basis of human immune function and dysfunction, we performed an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) study of purified CD4(+) T cells and monocytes, representing adaptive and innate immunity, in a multi-ethnic cohort of 461 healthy individuals. Context-specific cis- and trans-eQTLs were identified, and cross-population mapping allowed, in some cases, putative functional assignment of candidate causal regulatory variants for disease-associated loci. We note an over-representation of T cell-specific eQTLs among susceptibility alleles for autoimmune diseases and of monocyte-specific eQTLs among Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease variants. This polarization implicates specific immune cell types in these diseases and points to the need to identify the cell-autonomous effects of disease susceptibility variants.

24786328|t|Olfactory delayed matching to sample performance in mice: sex differences in the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
24786328|a|While olfactory delayed matching-to-sample tasks have been used to assess working memory in rats, no such tasks have been tested in mice. Olfactory delayed matching-to-sample learning was assessed in male and female 5XFAD mice, a model of Alzheimer's disease, and their wildtype (B6SJL F1) littermates at 6-7 months of age using an operant olfactometer. All 5XFAD and wildtype mice were able to learn the delayed olfactory matching-to-sample task at 2 and 5s delays. Fewer mice learned with a 10s delay and only one mouse learned with a 30s delay. Female mice showed higher levels of performance on the delayed matching-to-sample task than males, indicative of better working memory. These results demonstrate for the first time that mice are able to learn an olfactory delayed matching to sample task.

24786631|t|Brain gene expression patterns differentiate mild cognitive impairment from normal aged and Alzheimer's disease.
24786631|a|Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents a cognitive state intermediate between normal aging and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). To investigate if the molecular signature of MCI parallels the clinical picture, we use microarrays to extensively profile gene expression in 4 cortical brain regions (entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, superior frontal gyrus, post-central gyrus) using the postmortem tissue from cognitively normal aged controls, MCI, and AD cases. Our data reveal that gene expression patterns in MCI are not an extension of aging, and for the most part, are not intermediate between aged controls and AD. Functional enrichment analysis of significant genes revealed prominent upregulation in MCI brains of genes associated with anabolic and biosynthetic pathways (notably transcription, protein biosynthesis, protein trafficking, and turnover) as well as mitochondrial energy generation. In addition, many synaptic genes showed altered expression in MCI, predominantly upregulation, including genes for central components of the vesicle fusion machinery at the synapse, synaptic vesicle trafficking, neurotransmitter receptors, and synaptic structure and stabilization. These data suggest that there is a rebalancing of synaptic transmission in the MCI brain. To investigate if synaptic gene expression levels in MCI were related to cognitive function, Pearson correlation coefficient between the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and region-specific messenger RNA expression were computed for MCI cases. A number of synaptic genes showed strong significant correlations (r > 0.8, p < 0.01) most notably in the entorhinal cortex, with fewer in the hippocampus, and very few in neocortical regions. The synaptic genes with highly significant correlations were predominantly related to synaptic transmission and plasticity, and myelin composition. Unexpectedly, we found that gene expression changes that facilitate synaptic excitability and plasticity were overwhelmingly associated with poorer MMSE, and conversely that gene expression changes that inhibit plasticity were positively associated with MMSE. These data suggest that there are excessive excitability and apparent plasticity in limbic brain regions in MCI, that is associated with impaired synaptic and cognitive function. Such changes would be predicted to contribute to increased excitability, in turn leading to greater metabolic demand and ultimately progressive degeneration and AD, if not controlled.

24786790|t|Prolyl isomerase Pin1 acts downstream of miR200c to promote cancer stem-like cell traits in breast cancer.
24786790|a|Breast cancer stem-like cells (BCSC) have been implicated in tumor growth, metastasis, drug resistance, and relapse but druggable targets in appropriate subsets of this cell population have yet to be identified. Here we identify a fundamental role for the prolyl isomerase Pin1 in driving BCSC expansion, invasiveness, and tumorigenicity, defining it as a key target of miR200c, which is known to be a critical regulator in BCSC. Pin1 overexpression expanded the growth and tumorigenicity of BCSC and triggered epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Conversely, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Pin1 reduced the abundance and self-renewal activity of BCSC. Moreover, moderate overexpression of miR200c-resistant Pin1 rescued the BCSC defect in miR200c-expressing cells. Genetic deletion of Pin1 also decreased the abundance and repopulating capability of normal mouse mammary stem cells. In human cells, freshly isolated from reduction mammoplasty tissues, Pin1 overexpression endowed BCSC traits to normal breast epithelial cells, expanding both luminal and basal/myoepithelial lineages in these cells. In contrast, Pin1 silencing in primary breast cancer cells freshly isolated from clinical samples inhibited the expansion, self-renewal activity, and tumorigenesis of BCSC in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our work demonstrated that Pin1 is a pivotal regulator acting downstream of miR200c to drive BCSC and breast tumorigenicity, highlighting a new therapeutic target to eradicate BCSC.

24787918|t|Region-specific expression of tau, amyloid-beta protein precursor, and synaptic proteins at physiological condition or under endoplasmic reticulum stress in rats.
24787918|a|Region-specific neurodegeneration was reported in brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the mechanism is not fully understood. Here, we studied the expression of some AD-associated proteins in temporal cortex, frontal cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus of 4-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats. Levels of the phosphorylated tau at Thr231, Ser396, and Ser202/Thr205, phosphorylated amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) and amyloid-beta, synapse-associated proteins glutamate receptors 2, N-methyl-D-aspartic receptors 1 (NR1), NR2A, NR2B, and postsynaptic density protein 95 were much lower in cerebellum, while the levels of total tau, phosphorylated tau at Thr205, Ser214, Ser262, and Ser198/199/202 epitopes, and total AbetaPP were similar in the four brain regions. As endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was reported in the early stage of AD, we injected tunicamycin, an ER stress inducer, into the lateral ventricular of rats and 48 hours later found in the other three brain regions but not cerebellum, increasing of binding immunoglobulin protein with the increased phosphorylation of pancreatic ER kinase, inositol-requiring enzyme 1, and activating transcription factor 6. Simultaneously, levels of phosphorylated tau at all of the above sites were significantly increased with the activation of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta in temporal cortex, frontal cortex, and/or hippocampus, but not cerebellum. The synapse-associated proteins, GluR2, PSD95, and synapsin1, were found decreased in the hippocampus after tunicamycin exposure. These data together may partially explain why the AD-like neuropathology, such as formation of neurofibrillary tangles, was rarely detected in cerebellum.

24787921|t|Is amyloid-beta an innocent bystander and marker in Alzheimer's disease? Is the liability of multivalent cation homeostasis and its influence on amyloid-beta function the real mechanism?
24787921|a|Two decades of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) hypothesis in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the prominence of Abeta-targeting strategies have yet to meet the levels of original expectation. Disappointing results in numerous Phase II/III studies have called for a re-examination of the validity of the Abeta-targeting approaches as an intervention strategy in AD. The mid-life onset of chronic conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, insulin intolerance, and depression nominated as risk factors for the later development of AD) points to the possibility that each condition could involve mechanisms, which while relatively modest over a short-term, could have significant accumulative effects. What may also not be fully appreciated is that a number of these conditions involve potential disturbances to multivalent cations (MC) levels through various mechanisms such as autophagy, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Furthermore, some MCs have intimate associations with the mechanisms by which Abeta pathology manifests. Considering various lines of evidence and incorporating statistical analysis on Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) data of both causes of and prevalence of multifactorial risk factors in different world regions, we propose an MC hypothesis for AD. More specifically, we suggest that MC imbalance marks many chronic conditions and because of their involvement with Abeta pathology, could reflect that Abeta may be a vital manifestation and marker of underlying MC imbalance. Thus, careful targeting of MC imbalance may provide an alternative or complementary interventional approach to current Abeta treatment strategies.

24790184|t|Peripheral administration of a humanized anti-PrP antibody blocks Alzheimer's disease Abeta synaptotoxicity.
24790184|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with pathological assembly states of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta). Abeta-related synaptotoxicity can be blocked by anti-prion protein (PrP) antibodies, potentially allowing therapeutic targeting of this aspect of AD neuropathogenesis. Here, we show that intravascular administration of a high-affinity humanized anti-PrP antibody to rats can prevent the plasticity-disrupting effects induced by exposure to soluble AD brain extract. These results provide an in vivo proof of principle for such a therapeutic strategy.

24792732|t|Effects of aluminium on beta-amyloid (1-42) and secretases (APP-cleaving enzymes) in rat brain.
24792732|a|Chronic administration of aluminium has been proposed as an environmental factor that may affect some pathological changes related to neurotoxicity and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The abnormal generation and deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in senile plaques are hallmark features in the brains of AD patients. Furthermore, Abeta is generated by the sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) via the APP cleaving enzyme (alpha-secretase, or beta-secretase) and gamma-secretase. In the present study, we investigated the modulation of Abeta deposition and neurotoxicity in aluminium-maltolate-treated (0, 15, 30, 45 mmol/kg body weight via intraperitoneal injection) in experimental rats. We measured Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 in the cortex and hippocampus in rat brains using ELISA. Subtypes of alpha-secretase, beta-secretase, and gamma-secretase, including ADAM9, ADAM10, ADAM17 (TACE), BACE1, presenilin 1 (PS1) and nicastrin (NCT), were determined using western blotting analyses. These results indicated that aluminium-maltolate induced an AD-like behavioural deficit in rats at 30 and 45 mmol/kg body weight. Moreover, the Abeta1-42 content increased significantly, both in the cortex and hippocampus, although no changes were observed in Abeta1-40. Furthermore, ADAM9, ADAM10, and ADAM17 decreased significantly; in contrast, BACE1, PS1, and NCT showed significant increase. Taken together, these results suggest that the changes in secretases may correlate to the abnormal deposition of Abeta by aluminium in rat brains.

24792821|a|In 2007, International Society of Clinical Densitometry Pediatric Positions Task Forces reviewed the evidence for the clinical application of peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) in children and adolescents. At that time, numerous limitations regarding the clinical application of pQCT were identified, although its use as a research modality for investigation of bone strength was highlighted. The present report provides an updated review of evidence for the clinical application of pQCT, as well as additional reviews of whole body QCT scans of the central and peripheral skeletons, and high-resolution pQCT in children. Although these techniques remain in the domain of research, this report summarizes the recent literature and evidence of the clinical applicability and offers general recommendations regarding the use of these modalities in pediatric bone health assessment.

24792906|t|Amyloid-beta alters ongoing neuronal activity and excitability in the frontal cortex.
24792906|a|The effects of amyloid-beta on the activity and excitability of individual neurons in the early and advanced stages of the pathological progression of Alzheimer's disease remain unknown. We used in vivo intracellular recordings to measure the ongoing and evoked activity of pyramidal neurons in the frontal cortex of APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice and age-matched nontransgenic littermate controls. Evoked excitability was altered in both transgenic groups: neurons in young transgenic mice displayed hypoexcitability, whereas those in older transgenic mice displayed hyperexcitability, suggesting changes in intrinsic electrical properties of the neurons. However, the ongoing activity of neurons in both young and old transgenic groups showed signs of hyperexcitability in the depolarized state of the membrane potential. The membrane potential of neurons in old transgenic mice had an increased tendency to fail to transition to the depolarized state, and the depolarized states had shorter durations on average than did controls. This suggests a combination of both intrinsic electrical and synaptic dysfunctions as mechanisms for activity changes at later stages of the neuropathological progression.

24792907|t|Calcium regulates the interaction of amyloid precursor protein with Homer3 protein.
24792907|a|Ca(2+) dysregulation is an important factor implicated in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. The mechanisms mediating the reciprocal regulation of Ca(2+) homeostasis and amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, function, and protein interactions are not well known. We have previously shown that APP interacts with Homer proteins, which inhibit APP processing toward amyloid-beta. In this study, we investigated the effect of Ca(2+) homeostasis alterations on APP/Homer3 interaction. Influx of extracellular Ca(2+) upon treatment of HEK293 cells with the ionophore A23187 or addition of extracellular Ca(2+) in cells starved of calcium specifically reduced APP/Homer3 but not APP/X11a interaction. Endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) store depletion by thapsigargin followed by store-operated calcium entry also decreased the interaction. Interestingly, application of a phospholipase C stimulator, which causes inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release, caused dissociation of APP/Homer3 complex. In human neuroblastoma cells, membrane depolarization also disrupted the interaction. This is the first study showing that changes in Ca(2+) homeostasis affect APP protein interactions. Our results suggest that Ca(2+) and Homers play a significant role in the development of Alzheimer's disease pathology.

24793098|t|Classical swine fever in China: a minireview.
24793098|a|Classical swine fever (CSF), caused by Classical swine fever virus (CSFV), is an OIE-listed, highly contagious, often fatal disease of swine worldwide. Currently, the disease is controlled by prophylactic vaccination in China and many other countries using the modified live vaccines derived from C-strain, which was developed in China in the mid-1950s. This minireview summarizes the epidemiology, diagnostic assays, control and challenges of CSF in China. Though CSF is essentially under control, complete eradication of CSF in China remains a challenging task and needs long-term, joint efforts of stakeholders.

24793183|t|Association of hypometabolism and amyloid levels in aging, normal subjects.
24793183|a|OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the relationship of amyloid, seen on Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-PET, and metabolism, seen on [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET, in normal subjects to better understand pathogenesis and biomarker selection in presymptomatic subjects. METHODS: Normal participants (aged 70-95 years; 600 with PiB-PET, FDG-PET, and MRI) were included. We performed a cross-sectional evaluation and subcategorized participants into amyloid-negative (<1.4), high-normal (1.4-1.5), positive (1.5-2.0), and markedly positive (>2.0) PiB standardized uptake value ratio groups representing different levels of amyloid brain load. Associations with metabolism were assessed in each group. Relationships with APOE epsilon4 carriage were evaluated. RESULTS: Hypometabolism in "Alzheimer disease (AD)-signature" regions was strongly associated with PiB load. Hypometabolism was greater with more positive PiB levels. Additional, more-diffuse cortical hypometabolism was also found to be associated with PiB, although less so. No hypermetabolism was seen in any subset. No significant incremental hypometabolism was seen in APOE-positive vs -negative subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Hypometabolism in PiB-positive, cognitively normal subjects in a population-based cohort occurs in AD-signature cortical regions and to a lesser extent in other cortical regions. It is more pronounced with higher amyloid load and supports a dose-dependent association. The effect of APOE epsilon4 carriage in this group of subjects does not appear to modify their hypometabolic "AD-like" neurodegeneration. Consideration of hypometabolism associated with amyloid load may aid trials of AD drug therapy.

24793188|t|Antemortem MRI findings associated with microinfarcts at autopsy.
24793188|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine antemortem MRI findings associated with microinfarcts at autopsy. METHODS: Patients with microinfarcts (n = 22) and patients without microinfarcts (n = 44) who underwent antemortem MRI were identified from a dementia clinic-based, population-based, and community clinic-based autopsy cohort. The microinfarct and no-microinfarct groups were matched on age at MRI, age at death, sex, APOE status, Mini-Mental State Examination score, and pathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer disease. Brain infarcts were assessed on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI. White matter hyperintensities on FLAIR MRI and hippocampal volumes on T1-weighted MRI were quantified using automated methods. A subset of subjects with microinfarcts (n = 15) and a matched group of subjects without microinfarcts (n = 15) had serial T1-weighted MRIs and were included in an analysis of global and regional brain atrophy rates using automated methods. RESULTS: The presence of cortical (p = 0.03) and subcortical (p = 0.02) infarcts on antemortem MRI was associated with presence of microinfarcts at autopsy. Higher numbers of cortical (p = 0.05) and subcortical (p = 0.03) infarcts on antemortem MRI were also associated with presence of microinfarcts. Presence of microinfarcts was not associated with white matter hyperintensities and cross-sectional hippocampal volume on antemortem MRI. Whole-brain and regional precuneus, motor, and somatosensory atrophy rates were higher in subjects with microinfarcts compared to subjects without microinfarcts. CONCLUSIONS: Microinfarcts increase brain atrophy rates independent of Alzheimer disease pathology. Association between microinfarct pathology and macroinfarcts on MRI suggests either common risk factors or a shared pathophysiology and potentially common preventive targets.

24793311|t|Atorvastatin prevents amyloid-beta peptide oligomer-induced synaptotoxicity and memory dysfunction in rats through a p38 MAPK-dependent pathway.
24793311|a|AIM: To investigate whether atorvastatin treatment could prevent Abeta1-42 oligomer (AbetaO)-induced synaptotoxicity and memory dysfunction in rats, and to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the neuroprotective actions of atorvastatin. METHODS: SD rats were injected with AbetaOs (5 nmol, icv). The rats were administrated with atorvastatin (10 mg kg(-1) d(-1), po) for 2 consecutive weeks (the first dose was given 5 d before AbetaOs injection). The memory impairments were evaluated with Morris water maze task. The expression of inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus was determined using ELISA assays. The levels of PSD-95 and p38MAPK proteins in rat hippocampus were evaluated using Western blot analysis. For in vitro experiments, cultured rat hippocampal neurons were treated with AbetaOs (50 nmol/L) for 48 h. The expression of MAP-2 and synaptophysin in the neurons was detected with immunofluorescence. RESULTS: The AbetaO-treated rats displayed severe memory impairments in Morris water maze tests, and markedly reduced levels of synaptic proteins synaptophysin and PSD-95, increased levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha) and p38MAPK activation in the hippocampus. All these effects were prevented or substantially attenuated by atorvastatin administration. Pretreatment of cultured hippocampal neurons with atorvastatin (1 and 5 mumol/L) concentration-dependently attenuated the AbetaO-induced synaptotoxicity, including the loss of dendritic marker MAP-2, and synaptic proteins synaptophysin and PSD-95. Pretreatment of the cultured hippocampal neurons with the p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (5 mumol/L) blocked the AbetaO-induced loss of synaptophysin and PSD-95. CONCLUSION: Atorvastatin prevents AbetaO-induced synaptotoxicity and memory dysfunction through a p38MAPK-dependent pathway.

24793844|t|Animal models of Alzheimer disease: historical pitfalls and a path forward.
24793844|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is a medically and financially overwhelming condition, and incidence rates are expected to triple by 2050.Despite decades of research in animal models of AD, the disease remains incompletely understood, with few treatment options. This review summarizes historical and current AD research efforts, with emphasis on the disparity between preclinical animal studies and the reality of human disease and how this has impacted clinical trials. Ultimately, we provide a mechanism for shifting the focus of AD research away from animal models to focus primarily on human biology as a means to improve the applicability of research findings to human disease. Implementation of these alternatives may hasten development of improved strategies to prevent, detect, ameliorate, and possibly cure this devastating disease.

24794719|t|Rapamycin protects against Abeta-induced synaptotoxicity by increasing presynaptic activity in hippocampal neurons.
24794719|a|The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is involved in the regulation of learning and memory. Recently, rapamycin has been shown to be neuroprotective in models for Alzheimer's disease in an autophagy-dependent manner. Here we show that rapamycin exerts neuroprotection via a novel mechanism that involves presynaptic activation. Rapamycin increases the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents and calcium transients of rat hippocampal primary neurons by a mechanism that involves the up regulation of SV2, a presynaptic vesicular protein linked to neurotransmitter release. Under these conditions, rapamycin-treated hippocampal neurons are resistant to the synaptotoxic effect induced by Abeta oligomers, suggesting that enhancers of presynaptic activity can be therapeutic agents for Alzheimer's disease.

24795085|t|Clinical utility of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in the diagnosis of early Alzheimer's disease.
24795085|a|Several potential disease-modifying drugs for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have failed to show any effect on disease progression in clinical trials, conceivably because the AD subjects are already too advanced to derive clinical benefit from treatment and because diagnosis based on clinical criteria alone introduces a high misdiagnosis rate. Thus, well-validated biomarkers for early detection and accurate diagnosis are crucial. Low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of the amyloid-beta (Abeta1-42) peptide, in combination with high total tau and phosphorylated tau, are sensitive and specific biomarkers highly predictive of progression to AD dementia in patients with mild cognitive impairment. However, interlaboratory variations in the results seen with currently available immunoassays are of concern. Recent worldwide standardization efforts and quality control programs include standard operating procedures for both preanalytical (e.g., lumbar puncture and sample handling) and analytical (e.g., preparation of calibration curve) procedures. Efforts are also ongoing to develop highly reproducible assays on fully automated instruments. These global standardization and harmonization measures will provide the basis for the generalized international application of CSF biomarkers for both clinical trials and routine clinical diagnosis of AD.

24795090|t|International Committee for Monitoring Assisted Reproductive Technologies world report: Assisted Reproductive Technology 2006.
24795090|a|STUDY QUESTION: What are the access, effectiveness and safety of assisted reproductive technology (ART) worldwide in 2006? SUMMARY ANSWER: ART access, effectiveness and safety vary markedly among countries. Overall, there was an increase in the use of ICSI, single embryo transfer (SET) and frozen embryo transfer (FET). There was a decline in the multiple delivery rate (DR) and preterm birth rate. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: ART is widely practiced worldwide and there is a need for its continuous monitoring to improve the comprehensiveness and quality of ART data and services. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This is a retrospective, cross-sectional survey of ART cycles undertaken worldwide in 2006. PARTICIPANTS, SETTING, METHODS: A total of 2352 clinics in 56 countries provided data. Data were analyzed at a country and regional level. The forms for data collection were developed by the International Committee Monitoring Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ICMART) and sent to each country or regional ART register. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A total of >1,050,300 initiated cycles resulted in an estimated >256,668 babies. The overall pregnancy rates (PRs) and DRs per aspiration for IVF were 30.7 and 22.8%, respectively, and for ICSI 29.7 and 20.0%, respectively. The PRs and DRs for FETs were 26.4 and 17.8%, respectively. Multiple DR per PR were 22.2% for twins and 1.5% for triplets following fresh IVF/ICSI and 16.4% for twins and 0.8% for triplets for FETs. Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome complicated >4585 cycles (0.6%). Access to ART varied from 11 to 3988 cycles per million population. ICSI comprised 66.0% of all initiated cycles, FET 27.4% and SET 20.7%. Perinatal mortality rate was 25.2 per 1000 births for fresh IVF/ICSI and 17.5 per 1000 for FETs. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: 44.6% of the countries provided incomplete data. Quality of data varies among individual countries and is dependant on the policy of the local regulatory authority for monitoring ART clinics. Continuous efforts are needed to improve comprehensiveness and quality of data collected. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Adopting the policy of SET, FET and the cessation of transferring more than two embryos should be widely applied. ICMART will continue helping countries and regions to establish their own ART registries. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): ICMART receives financial support from medical societies: European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE), American Society for Reproduction Medicine (ASRM), Fertility Society of Australia (FSA), Japan Society for Reproductive Medicine (JSRM), Latin American Network for Reproductive Medicine (REDLARA) and Middle East Fertility Society (MEFS) and Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART).

24796810|t|The amyloid-beta degradation pattern in plasma--a possible tool for clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease.
24796810|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) is the main component of plaques, the central neuropathological hallmark in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta is derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretase-mediated cleavages. A large number of Abeta peptides are found in cerebrospinal fluid and these peptides are produced in specific metabolic pathways, which are important for diagnosis, in drug development and to explore disease pathogenesis. To investigate whether a similar pattern could be found also in blood samples, an immunoprecipitation (IP) based method for enrichment of Abeta peptides from human plasma was developed. The peptides were analyzed using matrix-assisted-laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight mass spectrometry for Abeta profiling and selected reaction monitoring (SRM) for MS quantification of Abeta1-38, Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 using tripe quadrupole MS. Sixteen N- or C-terminally truncated Abeta peptides were reproducibly detected in human plasma, of which 11 were verified by tandem MS. In a pilot study including 9 AD patients and 10 controls, where Abeta1-38, Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 were quantified using SRM, no AD-associated change in plasma levels of the peptides were observed. Using MS-based measurement techniques, we show that several Abeta peptides can be monitored in a single analysis and the developed methods have the potential to be used as a read out in clinical trials of drugs affecting APP processing or Abeta homeostasis.

24797962|t|Clinical predictors of severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy and influence of APOE genotype in persons with pathologically verified Alzheimer disease.
24797962|a|IMPORTANCE: Although cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) has important clinical implications, our understanding of it and ability to diagnose it are limited. OBJECTIVE: To determine pathological correlates and clinical factors identifiable during life that predict the presence of severe CAA in persons with pathologically confirmed Alzheimer disease (AD). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We compared demographic and clinical variables at the earliest visit during life at which participants were found to have cognitive impairment and compared pathological variables between persons ultimately found to have no or severe CAA at autopsy using logistic regression. Analyses were repeated separately for carriers and noncarriers of the APOE epsilon4 allele. Data were obtained from the Uniform Data Set, which comprises longitudinal clinical assessments performed in the Alzheimer's Disease Centers funded by the National Institute on Aging. Participants included 193 persons with AD and severe CAA and 232 persons with AD and no CAA. All participants had cognitive impairment and met National Institute on Aging-Reagan Institute neuropathological criteria for AD. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prevalence of demographic characteristics and the APOE epsilon4 allele and odds ratios (ORs) of clinical variables for the prediction of severe CAA. RESULTS: Persons with severe CAA compared with those without CAA were more likely to carry an APOE epsilon4 allele (64.9% vs 42.8%, respectively; P < .001), to be Hispanic (6.8% vs 1.3%, respectively; P = .003), to have had a transient ischemic attack (12.5% vs 6.1%, respectively; OR = 2.1; 95% CI, 1.0-4.4), and to have lower degrees of diffuse amyloid plaque pathology (mean [SD] Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease score, 1.2 [0.5] vs 1.4 [0.8], respectively; P = .01). Those with CAA compared with those without CAA more commonly had intracerebral hemorrhage (9.3% vs 3.5%, respectively; P = .01), cortical microinfarcts (20.7% vs 12.9%, respectively; P = .03), and subcortical leukoencephalopathy (20.5% vs 12.1%, respectively; P = .02). Noncarriers of the APOE epsilon4 allele with severe CAA compared with those without CAA had a higher prevalence of stroke (11.1% vs 3.9%, respectively; OR = 3.8; 95% CI, 1.0-14.6) and hypercholesterolemia (50.0% vs 32.7%, respectively; OR = 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1-4.7). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Being Hispanic and having had a transient ischemic attack-like episode were predictors of CAA in persons with AD. Less diffuse parenchymal amyloid pathology in persons with severe CAA suggests a difference in beta-amyloid trafficking.

24801214|t|Geniposide attenuates oligomeric Abeta(1-42)-induced inflammatory response by targeting RAGE-dependent signaling in BV2 cells.
24801214|a|The neuroinflammation induced by amyloid-beta (Abeta) is one of the key events in Alzheimer's disease (AD) progress in which microglia are the main cells involved. Receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) mediates and enhances Abeta-induced microglial activation and leads to induction of proinflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta). Geniposide, a pharmacologically active component purified from gardenia fruit, exhibits a broad spectrum anti-inflammatory effect as well as neurotrophic and neuroprotective properties. However, the effects of geniposide on Abeta-mediated microglial pathways have not been fully discovered. Here, we demonstrate that geniposide treatment significantly blocks Abeta-induced RAGE-dependent signaling (activation of ERK and NF-kappaB) along with the production of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta in cultured BV2 microglia cells. Notably, based on the data from coimmunoprecipitation assay, we infer that geniposide exerts protective effects on Abeta-induced inflammatroy response through blocking Abeta binding to RAGE and suppressing the RAGE-mediated signaling pathway. Taken together, these findings indicate that geniposide is a potent suppressor of neuroflammation through inhibiting RAGE-dependent signaling pathway. Thus, geniposide may be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of neuroinflammation that is involved in neurological diseases such as AD.

24801216|t|Early detection of cerebral glucose uptake changes in the 5XFAD mouse.
24801216|a|Brain glucose hypometabolism has been observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, and is detected with (18)F radiolabelled glucose, using positron emission tomography. A pathological hallmark of AD is deposition of brain beta- amyloid plaques that may influence cerebral glucose metabolism. The five times familial AD (5XFAD) mouse is a model of brain amyloidosis exhibiting AD-like phenotypes. This study examines brain beta-amyloid plaque deposition and (18)FDG uptake, to search for an early biomarker distinguishing 5XFAD from wild-type mice. Thus, brain (18)FDG uptake and plaque deposition was studied in these mice at age 2, 5 and 13 months. The 5XFAD mice demonstrated significantly reduced brain (18)FDG uptake at 13 months relative to wild-type controls but not in younger mice, despite substantial beta- amyloid plaque deposition. However, by comparing the ratio of uptake values for glucose in different regions in the same brain, 5XFAD mice could be distinguished from controls at age 2 months. This method of measuring altered glucose metabolism may represent an early biomarker for the progression of amyloid deposition in the brain. We conclude that brain (18)FDG uptake can be a sensitive biomarker for early detection of abnormal metabolism in the 5XFAD mouse when alternative relative uptake values are utilized.

24801220|t|Dimebon attenuates the Abeta-induced mitochondrial permeabilization.
24801220|a|The currently available experimental data supports the hypothesis that the neuroprotective effect of dimebon is related to the protection of the brain-mitochondria from neurodegeneration. In this study, the influence of dimebon on mitochondria was investigated to gain a better understanding of the neuroprotective effects of this drug. Here, we demonstrate that dimebon enhances the resistance of the isolated rat brain and liver mitochondria to the induction of mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) by calcium ions even in the presence of atractyloside, a MPT pore (MPTP) opener, but is ineffective against atractyloside-induced mitochondria swelling. Unlike cyclosporine A (CsA), a MPTP inhibitor, Dimebon does not influence the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) conformational changes and is not able to prevent the MPT of de-energized mitochondria. Using three different assays, and using amyloid-beta peptide for inducing mitochondrial toxicity, we show that the influence of dimebon on the calcium retention capacity (CRC) of mitochondria depends on the mode of calcium addition. No obvious influence of dimebon on CRC was observed under the conditions of calcium infusion in the pump mode but the increase of CRC of rat brain mitochondria was observed when calcium was added in the bolus mode; the addition of calcium in the single pulse mode led to the increase of the lag period of calcium efflux from mitochondria. From these studies it is shown that dimebon is effective against amyloid-beta (Abeta) potentiated mitochondrial swelling and decrease of calcium retention capacity (CRC) of the brain mitochondria.

24802697|t|Pyroglutamylated amyloid-beta peptide reverses cross beta-sheets by a prion-like mechanism.
24802697|a|The amyloid hypothesis causatively relates the fibrillar deposits of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) to Alzheimer's disease (AD). More recent data, however, identify the soluble oligomers as the major cytotoxic entities. Pyroglutamylated Abeta (pE-Abeta) is present in AD brains and exerts augmented neurotoxicity, which is believed to result from its higher beta-sheet propensity and faster fibrillization. While this concept is based on a set of experimental results, others have reported similar beta-sheet contents in unmodified and pyroglutamylated Abeta, and slower aggregation of pE-Abeta as compared to unmodified Abeta, leaving the issue unresolved. Here, we assess the structural differences between Abeta and pE-Abeta peptides that may underlie their distinct cytotoxicities. Transmission electron microscopy identifies a larger number of prefibrillar aggregates of pE-Abeta at early stages of aggregation and suggests that pE-Abeta affects the fibrillogenesis even at low molar fractions. Circular dichroism and FTIR data indicate that while the unmodified Abeta readily forms beta-sheet fibrils in aqueous media, pE-Abeta displays increased alpha-helical and decreased beta-sheet propensity. Moreover, isotope-edited FTIR spectroscopy shows that pE-Abeta reverses beta-sheet formation and hence fibrillogenesis of the unmodified Abeta peptide via a prion-like mechanism. These data provide a novel structural mechanism for pE-Abeta hypertoxicity; pE-Abeta undergoes faster formation of prefibrillar aggregates due to its increased hydrophobicity, thus shifting the initial stages of fibrillogenesis toward smaller, hypertoxic oligomers of partial alpha-helical structure.

24803005|t|Transient dynamics of Abeta contribute to toxicity in Alzheimer's disease.
24803005|a|The aggregation and deposition of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) in the brain has been linked with neuronal death, which progresses in the diagnostic and pathological signs of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The transition of an unstructured monomeric peptide into self-assembled and more structured aggregates is the crucial conversion from what appears to be a harmless polypeptide into a malignant form that causes synaptotoxicity and neuronal cell death. Despite efforts to identify the toxic form of Abeta, the development of effective treatments for AD is still limited by the highly transient and dynamic nature of interconverting forms of Abeta. The variability within the in vivo "pool" of different Abeta peptides is another complicating factor. Here we review the dynamical interplay between various components that influence the heterogeneous Abeta system, from intramolecular Abeta flexibility to intermolecular dynamics between various Abeta alloforms and external factors. The complex dynamics of Abeta contributes to the causative role of Abeta in the pathogenesis of AD.

24806669|t|A death receptor 6-amyloid precursor protein pathway regulates synapse density in the mature CNS but does not contribute to Alzheimer's disease-related pathophysiology in murine models.
24806669|a|Recent studies implicate death receptor 6 (DR6) in an amyloid precursor protein (APP)-dependent pathway regulating developmental axon pruning, and in a pruning pathway operating during plastic rearrangements in adult brain. DR6 has also been suggested to mediate toxicity in vitro of Abeta peptides derived from APP. Given the link between APP, Abeta, and Alzheimer's disease (AD), these findings have raised the possibility that DR6 contributes to aspects of neurodegeneration in AD. To test this possibility, we have used mouse models to characterize potential function(s) of DR6 in the adult CNS and in AD-related pathophysiology. We show that DR6 is broadly expressed within the adult CNS and regulates the density of excitatory synaptic connections onto pyramidal neurons in a genetic pathway with APP. DR6 knock-out also gives rise to behavioral abnormalities, some of which are similar to those previously documented in APP knock-out animals. However, in two distinct APP transgenic models of AD, we did not observe any alteration in the formation of amyloid plaques, gliosis, synaptic loss, or cognitive behavioral deficits with genetic deletion of DR6, though we did observe a transient reduction in the degree of microglial activation in one model. Our results support the view that DR6 functions with APP to modulate synaptic density in the adult CNS, but do not provide evidence for a role of DR6 in the pathophysiology of AD.

24806670|t|Genetic analysis reveals that amyloid precursor protein and death receptor 6 function in the same pathway to control axonal pruning independent of beta-secretase.
24806670|a|In the developing brain, initial neuronal projections are formed through extensive growth and branching of developing axons, but many branches are later pruned to sculpt the mature pattern of connections. Despite its widespread occurrence, the mechanisms controlling pruning remain incompletely characterized. Based on pharmacological and biochemical analysis in vitro and initial genetic analysis in vivo, prior studies implicated a pathway involving binding of the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) to Death Receptor 6 (DR6) and activation of a downstream caspase cascade in axonal pruning. Here, we further test their involvement in pruning in vivo and their mechanism of action through extensive genetic and biochemical analysis. Genetic deletion of DR6 was previously shown to impair pruning of retinal axons in vivo. We show that genetic deletion of APP similarly impairs pruning of retinal axons in vivo and provide evidence that APP and DR6 act cell autonomously and in the same pathway to control pruning. Prior analysis had suggested that beta-secretase cleavage of APP and binding of an N-terminal fragment of APP to DR6 is required for their actions, but further genetic and biochemical analysis reveals that beta-secretase activity is not required and that high-affinity binding to DR6 requires a more C-terminal portion of the APP ectodomain. These results provide direct support for the model that APP and DR6 function cell autonomously and in the same pathway to control pruning in vivo and raise the possibility of alternate mechanisms for how APP and DR6 control pruning.

24808180|t|Deficiency of sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase impairs lysosomal metabolism of the amyloid precursor protein.
24808180|a|Progressive accumulation of the amyloid beta protein in extracellular plaques is a neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer disease. Amyloid beta is generated during sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretases. In addition to the proteolytic processing by secretases, APP is also metabolized by lysosomal proteases. Here, we show that accumulation of intracellular sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) impairs the metabolism of APP. Cells lacking functional S1P-lyase, which degrades intracellular S1P, strongly accumulate full-length APP and its potentially amyloidogenic C-terminal fragments (CTFs) as compared with cells expressing the functional enzyme. By cell biological and biochemical methods, we demonstrate that intracellular inhibition of S1P-lyase impairs the degradation of APP and CTFs in lysosomal compartments and also decreases the activity of gamma-secretase. Interestingly, the strong accumulation of APP and CTFs in S1P-lyase-deficient cells was reversed by selective mobilization of Ca(2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum or lysosomes. Intracellular accumulation of S1P also impairs maturation of cathepsin D and degradation of Lamp-2, indicating a general impairment of lysosomal activity. Together, these data demonstrate that S1P-lyase plays a critical role in the regulation of lysosomal activity and the metabolism of APP.

24810491|t|Early versus delayed initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy for HIV-positive adults with newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis (TB-HAART): a prospective, international, randomised, placebo-controlled trial.
24810491|a|BACKGROUND: WHO guidelines recommend early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) irrespective of CD4 cell count for all patients with tuberculosis who also have HIV, but evidence supporting this approach is poor quality. We assessed the effect of timing of ART initiation on tuberculosis treatment outcomes for HIV-positive patients with CD4 counts of 220 cells per muL or more. METHODS: We did this randomised, placebo-controlled trial between Jan 1, 2008, and April 31, 2013 at 26 treatment centres in South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia. We enrolled HIV-positive patients with culture-confirmed tuberculosis who had tolerated 2 weeks of tuberculosis short course chemotherapy. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to early ART (starting after 2 weeks of tuberculosis treatment) or delayed ART (placebo, then starting ART at the end of 6 months of tuberculosis treatment). Randomisation was computer generated, with permuted blocks of size eight, and stratified by CD4 count (220-349 cells per muL vs >=350 cells per muL). Patients and investigators were masked to treatment allocation until completion of 6-months' tuberculosis treatment, after which the study was open label. The primary endpoint was a composite of failure of tuberculosis treatment, tuberculosis recurrence, and death within 12 months of starting tuberculosis treatment in the modified intention-to-treat population. Secondary endpoints included mortality. The study is registered with controlled-trials.com (ISRCTN77861053). FINDINGS: We screened 13,588 patients and enrolled 1675: 834 assigned early ART, 841 delayed ART. The primary endpoint was reached by 65 (8 5%) of 767 patients in the early ART group versus 71 (9 2%) of 771 in the delayed ART group (relative risk [RR] 0 91, 95% CI 0 64-1 30; p=0 9). Of patients with a CD4 cell count of 220-349 cells per muL, 26 (7 9%) of 331 patients versus 33 (9 6%) of 342 reached the primary endpoint (RR 0 80, 95% CI 0 46-1 39; p=0 6). For those with 350 cells per muL or more, 39 (8 9%) of 436 versus 38 (8 9%) of 429 reached the primary endpoint (RR 1 01, 95% CI 0 63-1 62; p=0 4). Mortality did not differ significantly between treatment groups (RR 1 4, 95% CI 0 8-2 3; p=0 23). Grade 3 and 4 adverse events occurred in 149 (18%) of 834 patients assigned early ART versus 174 (21%) of 841 assigned delayed ART (p=0 37). 87 (10%) of 834 versus 84 (10%) of 841 had immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (p=0 56). INTERPRETATION: ART can be delayed until after completion of 6 months of tuberculosis treatment for HIV-positive patients with tuberculosis who have CD4 cell counts greater than 220 cells per muL. WHO guidelines should be updated accordingly. FUNDING: USAID, Zambia Ministry of Health, Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology, WHO-TDR.

24810551|t|The molecular structure of Alzheimer beta-amyloid fibrils formed in the presence of phospholipid vesicles.
24810551|a|beta-amyloid (Abeta) fibrils are the major species involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD). An atomic-resolution molecular structure of Abeta40 fibrils formed in the presence of lipid vesicles was obtained by using magic angle spinning (MAS) solid-state NMR spectroscopy. The fibril structures formed in the presence of the lipid vesicles are remarkably different from those formed in solution. These results provide insights into the molecular mechanism of Abeta aggregation in the presence of lipid vesicles.

24810634|t|Reflections on glycogen and beta-amyloid: why does glycogenolytic beta2-adrenoceptor stimulation not rescue memory after beta-amyloid?
24810634|a|Normally noradrenaline release ~30 min after training in the day-old chick is essential for memory consolidation by simultaneously increasing both glycogenolysis, by its stimulation of beta2-adrenergic (AR) receptors, and glycogen synthesis, by its stimulation of alpha2-AR receptors in astrocytes. At the same time noradrenaline stimulation of beta3-AR receptors increases glucose uptake solely in astrocytes. Intracerebral injection of small oligomeric beta-amyloid protein (Abeta1-42) (Abeta) 45 min before one-trial bead discrimination learning in day-old chicks abolishes consolidation of memory 30 min post-learning. The ensuing memory loss can be rescued by injection of selective beta3- and beta(2-AR agonists (CL316243 and zinterol), which also have the ability to consolidate weakly-reinforced learning into long-term memory. However, although CL316243 rescues Abeta-induced memory loss over a similar time period to when it consolidates weak learning (up to 25 min post training), zinterol is effective over a more limited time period and unexpectedly it does not rescue at the time it promotes glycogenolysis. Injection of Abeta into the hippocampus and the locus coeruleus (LoC) also produces similar memory deficits and injection of both AR agonists into a cortical area can rescue memory from LoC Abeta. We have previously shown that beta3-AR stimulation increases astrocytic glucose uptake and have suggested there may be sensitization or upregulation of the receptor. Since beta2-AR stimulation does not rescue memory at the time it promotes glycogenolysis, but the receptor does not appear to be impaired, it is suggested that Abeta may be causing an impairment in the synthesis of readily available glycogen.

24810766|t|Soy isoflavone antagonizes the oxidative cerebrovascular injury induced by beta-amyloid peptides 1-42 in rats.
24810766|a|Numerous evidences have shown that the antioxidative properties of soy isoflavone (SIF) have beneficial effects on prophylaxis of neurodegeneration, however, the mechanism is still not fully illustrated. As cerebrovascular dysfunction could initiate a cascade of events leading to pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, we tried to investigate whether SIF could protect the cerebrovascular system due to antagonizing oxidative damage induced by Abeta1-42 in present study. In addition, NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathways in the cerebrovascular tissue of Wistar rats were investigated to identify the potential cerebrovascular protective targets of SIF. Research results showed that SIF reduced the excessive production of nitrotyrosine in cerebrovascular tissue induced by Abeta1-42, and maintained redox homeostasis by increasing the level of GSH and GSH/GSSG. Moreover, SIF could alleviate the down-regulation of Nrf2, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, Heme oxygenase-1 expressions in cerebrovascular tissue induced by Abeta1-42 and suppress the increase of Kelch like ECH protein-1 (Keap1). These data suggested that SIF might reduce the cerebrovascular oxidative damage induced by Abeta1-42 through regulating the Nrf2 signaling pathway. The mechanisms of SIF modulating the potential target Nrf2 might be associated with Keap1 expression.

24810883|t|Xanthoceraside rescues learning and memory deficits through attenuating beta-amyloid deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation in APP mice.
24810883|a|Xanthoceraside, a triterpenoid saponin, has been shown to reverse cognitive deficits in several Alzheimer's disease (AD) animal models. However, the effects of xanthoceraside on the Abeta deposition pathology and the APP processing in AD are unclear. Here, we show that xanthoceraside at doses of 0.08 and 0.32 mg/kg/d for 6 months significantly improved learning and memory impairment in APP transgenic mice assessed by the Y maze and novel object recognition tests. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that xanthoceraside strongly attenuated beta-amyloid deposition in the brains of APP transgenic mice. Western blotting revealed that xanthoceraside decreased tau phosphorylation protein levels at Ser396 and Ser404 in the hippocampus; xanthoceraside also decreased APP protein levels and GSK-3beta phosphorylation. These results suggest that xanthoceraside could be a promising novel candidate for the therapy of AD.

24811241|t|Distinct pattern of hypometabolism and atrophy in preclinical and predementia Alzheimer's disease.
24811241|a|The goal of the present study was to determine the earliest patterns of hypometabolism and atrophy in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Stages of AD were defined by positron emission tomography imaging evidence of cortical amyloid pathology in addition to cognitive criteria. Subjects for the study were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database and divided into 4 groups: cognitively normal (CN) amyloid negative (Abeta-) elderly subjects (n = 36), CN amyloid-positive (Abeta+) (n = 21), early mild cognitive impairment Abeta+ (n = 65), and late mild cognitive impairment Abeta+ (n = 23) subjects. Region of interest-based (primary) and voxel-based (secondary) analyses were used to assess gray matter hypometabolism, quantified by [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography, and decrease in gray matter volume and cortical thickness was measured by magnetic resonance imaging. Region of interest- and voxel-based analyses showed significant hypometabolism but not atrophy in CN Abeta+ subjects compared with CN Abeta- subjects. The results suggest that hypometabolism exceeds atrophy in preclinical AD, supporting the notion that amyloid load may affect synaptic activity, leading to synaptic loss and subsequent neuronal loss.

24813062|t|Enhancement of the nonamyloidogenic pathway by exogenous NGF in an Alzheimer transgenic mouse model.
24813062|a|Nerve growth factor (NGF) is an important nerve cell growth regulatory factor and has an indispensable role in the development, survival and regeneration of the cholinergic basal forebrain (CBF) neurons, and it has multiple targets when used for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) therapy. In this study, we observed whether NGF can affect cholinergic neurons to change amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) metabolism process and reduce amyloidosis in AD brains. NGF was administered intranasally to APP/PS1 double-transgenic mice for 14weeks. We observed an increase in APP695 and ADAM10 and a decrease in BACE1 and PS1 protein levels and, subsequently, a reduction in Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 levels and Abeta burden were present in NGF-treated mice brains, suggesting that NGF enhanced the APP nonamyloidogenic cleavage pathway and reduced the Abeta generation in the APP/PS1 transgenic mice brains.

24813830|t|Schisantherin A recovers Abeta-induced neurodegeneration with cognitive decline in mice.
24813830|a|Schisantherin A (STA) is a main bioactive lignan isolated from Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill., which has been widely used as a tonic in traditional Chinese medicine for many years. Lots of studies have reported that STA exhibited anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. This paper was designed to investigate the effects of STA on cognitive function and neurodegeneration in the mouse control of Alzheimer's disease (AD) induced by Abeta1-42. It was found that successive intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of STA (0.01 and 0.1mg/kg) for 5days significantly attenuated Abeta1-42-induced learning and memory impairment as measured by the Y-maze test, shuttle-box test and Morris water maze test. Furthermore, STA at a dose of 0.1mg/kg restored the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) as well as the levels of Abeta1-42, malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) to some extent in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. It also noticeably improved the histopathological changes in the hippocampus. The results suggested that STA might protect against cognitive deficits, oxidative stress and neurodegeneration induced by Abeta1-42, and serve as a potential agent in treatment of AD.

24813882|t|Donepezil + propargylamine + 8-hydroxyquinoline hybrids as new multifunctional metal-chelators, ChE and MAO inhibitors for the potential treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
24813882|a|The synthesis, biochemical evaluation, ADMET, toxicity and molecular modeling of novel multi-target-directed Donepezil + Propargylamine + 8-Hydroxyquinoline (DPH) hybrids 1-7 for the potential prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease is described. The most interesting derivative was racemic alpha-aminotrile4-(1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)-2-(((8-hydroxyquinolin-5-yl)methyl)(prop-2-yn-1-yl)amino) butanenitrile (DPH6) [MAO A (IC50 = 6.2 +- 0.7 muM; MAO B (IC50 = 10.2 +- 0.9 muM); AChE (IC50 = 1.8 +- 0.1 muM); BuChE (IC50 = 1.6 +- 0.25 muM)], an irreversible MAO A/B inhibitor and mixed-type AChE inhibitor with metal-chelating properties. According to docking studies, both DPH6 enantiomers interact simultaneously with the catalytic and peripheral site of EeAChE through a linker of appropriate length, supporting the observed mixed-type AChE inhibition. Both enantiomers exhibited a relatively similar position of both hydroxyquinoline and benzyl moieties with the rest of the molecule easily accommodated in the relatively large cavity of MAO A. For MAO B, the quinoline system was hosted at the cavity entrance whereas for MAO A this system occupied the substrate cavity. In this disposition the quinoline moiety interacted directly with the FAD aromatic ring. Very similar binding affinity values were also observed for both enantiomers with ChE and MAO enzymes. DPH derivatives exhibited moderate to good ADMET properties and brain penetration capacity for CNS activity. DPH6 was less toxic than donepezil at high concentrations; while at low concentrations both displayed a similar cell viability profile. Finally, in a passive avoidance task, the antiamnesic effect of DPH6 was tested on mice with experimentally induced amnesia. DPH6 was capable to significantly decrease scopolamine-induced learning deficits in healthy adult mice.

24814382|t|Role of a prudent breakfast in improving cardiometabolic risk factors in subjects with hypercholesterolemia: a randomized controlled trial.
24814382|a|BACKGROUND & AIMS: It is unclear whether advising a prudent breakfast alone is sufficient to improve blood lipids and cardiometabolic risk factors in overweight hypercholesterolemic subjects. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a prudent low-fat breakfast (PB) rich in dietary fiber lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and other cardiometabolic risk factors in subjects with elevated LDL-cholesterol levels. METHODS: In a parallel, controlled, 12-week study, 79 healthy overweight subjects (all regular breakfast eaters) were randomly allocated to a group that received a PB based on Nordic foods provided ad libitum or a control group that consumed their usual breakfast. The primary outcome was plasma LDL-C. Secondary outcomes were other blood lipids, body weight, sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD), glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and inflammation markers (C-reactive protein [CRP] and tumor necrosis factor receptor-2 [TNF-R2]), and blood pressure. The PB was in accordance with national and Nordic nutrition recommendations and included oat bran porridge with low-fat milk or yogurt, bilberry or lingonberry jam, whole grain bread, low-fat spread, poultry or fatty fish, and fruit. RESULTS: No differences were found in LDL-C, other blood lipids, body weight, or glucose metabolism, but SAD, plasma CRP, and TNF-R2 decreased more during PB compared with controls (p < 0.05). In the overall diet, PB increased dietary fiber and beta-glucan compared with controls (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Advising a prudent breakfast for 3 months did not influence blood lipids, body weight, or glucose metabolism but reduced markers of visceral fat and inflammation. The trial was registered in the Current Controlled Trials database (http://www.controlled-trials.com); International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN): 84550872.

24815354|t|Endoplasmic reticulum stress mediates amyloid beta neurotoxicity via mitochondrial cholesterol trafficking.
24815354|a|Disrupted cholesterol homeostasis has been reported in Alzheimer disease and is thought to contribute to disease progression by promoting amyloid beta (Abeta) accumulation. In particular, mitochondrial cholesterol enrichment has been shown to sensitize to Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the increased cholesterol levels and its trafficking to mitochondria in Alzheimer disease remain poorly understood. Here, we show that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress triggered by Abeta promotes cholesterol synthesis and mitochondrial cholesterol influx, resulting in mitochondrial glutathione (mGSH) depletion in older age amyloid precursor protein/presenilin-1 (APP/PS1) mice. Mitochondrial cholesterol accumulation was associated with increased expression of mitochondrial-associated ER membrane proteins, which favor cholesterol translocation from ER to mitochondria along with specific cholesterol carriers, particularly the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein. In vivo treatment with the ER stress inhibitor 4-phenylbutyric acid prevented mitochondrial cholesterol loading and mGSH depletion, thereby protecting APP/PS1 mice against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. Similar protection was observed with GSH ethyl ester administration, which replenishes mGSH without affecting the unfolded protein response, thus positioning mGSH depletion downstream of ER stress. Overall, these results indicate that Abeta-mediated ER stress and increased mitochondrial cholesterol trafficking contribute to the pathologic progression observed in old APP/PS1 mice, and that ER stress inhibitors may be explored as therapeutic agents for Alzheimer disease.

24815946|t|p-Coumaric acid and ursolic acid from Corni fructus attenuated beta-amyloid(25-35)-induced toxicity through regulation of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway in PC12 cells.
24815946|a|Neuroinflammatory responses induced by amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) are important causes in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Blockade of Abeta has emerged as a possible therapeutic approach to control the onset of AD. This study investigated the neuroprotective effects and molecular mechanisms of p-coumaric acid (p-CA) and ursolic acid (UA) from Corni fructus against Abeta(25-35)-induced toxicity in PC12 cells. p-CA and UA significantly inhibited the expression of iNOS and COX-2 in Abeta(25-35)-injured PC12 cells. Blockade of nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and phosphorylation of IkappaB-alpha was also observed after p-CA and UA treatment. For the upstream kinases, UA exclusively reduced ERK1/2, p-38, and JNK phosphorylation, but p-CA suppressed ERK1/2 and JNK phosphorylation. Both compounds comprehensively inhibited NF-kappaB activity, but possibly with different upstream pathways. The results provide new insight into the pharmacological modes of p-CA and UA and their potential therapeutic application to AD.

24817338|t|Accuracy of diagnostic codes for identifying patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in the Veterans Affairs Health Care System.
24817338|a|BACKGROUND: International Classification of Diseases-9 (ICD-9) codes are useful in clinical research; however, the validity of ICD-9 codes for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients in multiple centers in the Veterans Affairs Health Care Systems (VA) has not been established. Our aim was to determine the accuracy of ICD-9 codes for Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) in the VA. METHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of IBD during 1999-2009 were identified by at least one ICD-9 code for CD (555.x) or UC (556.x) at the Houston and Ann Arbor VA Medical Centers and confirmed by chart review. A diagnosis of CD, UC, and IBD, unspecified (IBDU) was determined based on structured review of data in the VA medical records. Positive predictive values (PPV) were calculated for the codes using previously published ICD-9 algorithms. RESULTS: A total of 1,871 patients were identified with ICD-9 codes for IBD. Of these patients, 1,298 (69 %) were confirmed to have IBD, with 541 CD (41 %), 707 UC (55 %), and 50 IBDU (4 %) patients. An algorithm of 2 or more codes with at least one from an outpatient encounter improved the PPV (0.83 and 0.89 for CD and UC, respectively) compared a single code algorithm (PPV 0.59 and 0.66, respectively). CONCLUSION: Single ICD-9 codes are inadequate to accurately define IBD patients; however, ICD-9 code algorithms can be used to identify patients with UC or CD with high positive predictive value. The 2 code, at least 1 outpatient code algorithm was observed to have a high PPV and low miss rate.

24819277|t|17-AAG improves cognitive process and increases heat shock protein response in a model lesion with Abeta25-35.
24819277|a|Molecular chaperones, or heat shock proteins (HSP), have been implicated in numerous neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the accumulation of protein aggregates, such as Alzheimer disease. The agglomeration of insoluble structures of Abeta is thought to be responsible for neuronal death, which in turn leads to the loss of cognitive functions. Recent findings have shown that the induction of HSP decreases the level of abnormal protein aggregates, as well as demonstrating that 17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), an analogue of geldanamycin (GA), increases Abeta clearance through the induction of molecular chaperones in cell culture. In light of this discovery that HSP overexpression can be neuroprotective, the search for a way to pharmacologically induce the overexpression of HSP and other associated chaperones may lead to a promising approach for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of our study was to evaluate both the effect of 17-AAG on the cognitive process and the HSP response in rats injected with Abeta25-35 into the CA1 of the hippocampus. The results show that the injection of Abeta caused a significant increase in the expression of the HSP involved in the regulation of cellular proteostasis. While the HSP did not reverse excitotoxic damage, given that experimental subjects showed learning and memory deficits, the administration of 17-AAG prior to the injection of Abeta25-35 did show an improvement in the behavioral assessment that correlated with the upregulation of HSP70 in subjects injured with Abeta. Overall, our data shows that the pharmacological induction of HSP using 17-AAG may be an alternative treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

24820873|t|The Abeta peptide forms non-amyloid fibrils in the presence of carbon nanotubes.
24820873|a|Carbon nanotubes have specific properties that make them potentially useful in biomedicine and biotechnology. However, carbon nanotubes may themselves be toxic, making it imperative to understand how carbon nanotubes interact with biomolecules such as proteins. Here, we used NMR, CD, and ThT/fluorescence spectroscopy together with AFM imaging to study pH-dependent molecular interactions between single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide. The aggregation of the Abeta peptide, first into oligomers and later into amyloid fibrils, is considered to be the toxic mechanism behind Alzheimer's disease. We found that SWNTs direct the Abeta peptides to form a new class of beta-sheet-rich yet non-amyloid fibrils.

24820962|t|Neuroprotective effect of Chunghyuldan from amyloid beta oligomer induced neuroinflammation in vitro and in vivo.
24820962|a|Microglia-mediated inflammation is a major pathological mechanism contributing to Alzheimer's disease (AD), and has been proposed as a potential therapeutic target. Chunghyuldan (CHD; Qingxue-dan in Chinese and Daio-Orengedokuto in Japanese) possesses wide-ranging biological effects, including anti-hyperlipidemic, anti-stroke, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities that could affect neurological functions. In this study, we examined the effects of CHD in in-vitro and in-vivo models of AD induced by the oligomeric form of amyloid-beta (Abeta oligomer), which acts directly on microglia-mediated neuroinflammation to result in neuronal damage and cognitive impairment. CHD at 0.1-100 mug mL(-1) significantly protected PC12 cells and rat primary hippocampal cells from Abeta oligomer1-42 toxicity. In addition, CHD at 1-10 mug mL(-1) inhibited Abeta oligomer1-42 induced production of nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-1beta in microglial cells. In an in-vivo AD model, administration of CHD (50 mg (kg body mass)(-1), for 5 days, per oral) inhibited the activation of astrocytes and microglia in the dentate gyrus and neuronal damage in the CA1 of the ipsilateral hippocampus. Moreover, CHD ameliorated cognitive impairment induced by Abeta oligomer1-42 toxicity. These results demonstrate the neuroprotective effects of CHD through inhibition of microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in in-vitro and in-vivo AD-like models induced by Abeta oligomer1-42 toxicity.

24821312|t|Apolipoprotein E in Alzheimer's disease: an update.
24821312|a|The vast majority of Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases are late onset (LOAD), which is genetically complex with heritability estimates up to 80%. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) has been irrefutably recognized as the major genetic risk factor, with semidominant inheritance, for LOAD. Although the mechanisms that underlie the pathogenic nature of APOE in AD are still not completely understood, emerging data suggest that APOE contributes to AD pathogenesis through both amyloid-beta (Abeta)-dependent and Abeta-independent pathways. Given the central role for APOE in the modulation of AD pathogenesis, many therapeutic strategies have emerged, including converting APOE conformation, regulating APOE expression, mimicking APOE peptides, blocking the APOE/Abeta interaction, modulating APOE lipidation state, and gene therapy. Accumulating evidence also suggests the utility of APOE genotyping in AD diagnosis, risk assessment, prevention, and treatment response.

24821909|t|A novel Abeta-fibrinogen interaction inhibitor rescues altered thrombosis and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease mice.
24821909|a|Many Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients suffer from cerebrovascular abnormalities such as altered cerebral blood flow and cerebral microinfarcts. Recently, fibrinogen has been identified as a strong cerebrovascular risk factor in AD, as it specifically binds to beta-amyloid (Abeta), thereby altering fibrin clot structure and delaying clot degradation. To determine if the Abeta-fibrinogen interaction could be targeted as a potential new treatment for AD, we designed a high-throughput screen and identified RU-505 as an effective inhibitor of the Abeta-fibrinogen interaction. RU-505 restored Abeta-induced altered fibrin clot formation and degradation in vitro and inhibited vessel occlusion in AD transgenic mice. Furthermore, long-term treatment of RU-505 significantly reduced vascular amyloid deposition and microgliosis in the cortex and improved cognitive impairment in mouse models of AD. Our studies suggest that inhibitors targeting the Abeta-fibrinogen interaction show promise as therapy for treating AD.

24823497|t|Conversion of Abeta43 to Abeta40 by the successive action of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and angiotensin-converting enzyme.
24823497|a|The longer and neurotoxic species of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta), Abeta42 and Abeta43, contribute to Abeta accumulation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis and are considered to be the primary cause of the disease. In contrast, the predominant secreted form of Abeta, Abeta40, inhibits amyloid deposition and may have neuroprotective effects. We have reported that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) converts Abeta42 to Abeta40 and that Abeta43 is the earliest-depositing Abeta species in the amyloid precursor protein transgenic mouse brain. Here we found that Abeta43 can be converted to Abeta42 and to Abeta40 in mouse brain lysate. We further identified the brain Abeta43-to-Abeta42-converting enzyme as ACE2. The purified human ACE2 converted Abeta43 to Abeta42, and this activity was inhibited by a specific ACE2 inhibitor, DX600. Notably, the combination of ACE2 and ACE could convert Abeta43 to Abeta40. Our results indicate that the longer, neurotoxic forms of Abeta can be converted to the shorter, less toxic or neuroprotective forms of Abeta by ACE2 and ACE. Moreover, we found that ACE2 activity showed a tendency to decrease in the serum of AD patients compared with normal controls, suggesting an association between lower ACE2 activity and AD. Thus, maintaining brain ACE2 and ACE activities may be important for preventing brain amyloid neurotoxicity and deposition in Alzheimer's disease.

24825898|t|A neuroprotective brain-penetrating endopeptidase fusion protein ameliorates Alzheimer disease pathology and restores neurogenesis.
24825898|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by widespread neurodegeneration throughout the association cortex and limbic system, deposition of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) in the neuropil and around the blood vessels, and formation of neurofibrillary tangles. The endopeptidase neprilysin has been successfully used to reduce the accumulation of Abeta following intracranial viral vector delivery or ex vivo manipulated intracranial delivery. These therapies have relied on direct injections into the brain, whereas a clinically desirable therapy would involve i.v. infusion of a recombinant enzyme. We previously characterized a recombinant neprilysin that contained a 38-amino acid brain-targeting domain. Recombinant cell lines have been generated expressing this brain-targeted enzyme (ASN12). In this report, we characterize the ASN12 recombinant protein for pharmacology in a mouse as well as efficacy in two APPtg mouse models of AD. The recombinant ASN12 transited to the brain with a t1/2 of 24 h and accumulated to 1.7% of injected dose at 24 h following i.v. delivery. We examined pharmacodynamics in the tg2576 APPtg mouse with the prion promoter APP695 SWE mutation and in the Line41 mThy1 APP751 mutation mouse. Treatment of either APPtg mouse resulted in reduced Abeta, increased neuronal synapses, and improved learning and memory. In addition, the Line41 APPtg mice showed increased levels of C-terminal neuropeptide Y fragments and increased neurogenesis. These results suggest that the recombinant brain-targeted neprilysin, ASN12, may be an effective treatment for AD and warrant further investigation in clinical trials.

24827147|t|Apoptosis induced by Abeta25-35 peptide is Ca(2+) -IP3 signaling-dependent in murine astrocytes.
24827147|a|Although the accumulation of the neurotoxic peptide beta-amyloid (Abeta) in the central nervous system is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, whether Abeta acts in astrocytes is unclear, and downstream functional consequences have yet to be defined. Here, we show that cytosolic Ca(2+) dysregulation, induced by a neurotoxic fragment (Abeta25-35), caused apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner, leading to cytoplasmic Ca(2+) mobilization from extra- and intracellular sources, mainly from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via IP3 receptor activation. This mechanism was related to Abeta-mediated apoptosis by the intrinsic pathway because the expression of pro-apoptotic Bax was accompanied by its translocation in cells transfected with GFP-Bax. Abeta-mediated apoptosis was reduced by BAPTA-AM, a fast Ca(2+) chelator, indicating that an increase in intracellular Ca(2+) was involved in cell death. Interestingly, the Bax translocation was dependent on Ca(2+) mobilization from IP3 receptors because pre-incubation with xestospongin C, a selective IP3 receptor inhibitor, abolished this response. Taken together, these results provide evidence that Abeta dysregulation of Ca(2+) homeostasis induces ER depletion of Ca(2+) stores and leads to apoptosis; this mechanism plays a significant role in Abeta apoptotic cell death and might be a new target for neurodegeneration treatments.

24827481|t|Proton pump inhibitor use is associated with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients with liver cirrhosis.
24827481|a|OBJECTIVE: Accumulating evidence suggests that the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) is associated with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in cirrhotic patients, although the results are inconsistent. We aimed to examine whether PPI use is associated with SBP in Japan, where the administration of PPIs is strictly regulated. METHODS: In this single-center retrospective study, we reviewed 65 patients with liver cirrhosis who were admitted between January 2008 and January 2013 due to ascites. The administration of any PPI for at least one week prior to admission was regarded as PPI use. RESULTS: Eighteen cirrhotic patients with SBP and 47 without SBP were identified. Both the serum bilirubin levels and international normalized ratio (INR) values were significantly elevated in the patients with SBP (p=0.007, 0.002). The model for end-stage liver disease scores (mean+-SD) were 16.1+-9.9 and 12.5+-9.3 in those with and without SBP (p=0.009), respectively. PPIs were used in 16 out 18 in patients with SBP and 27 of 47 patients without SBP (p=0.002). A multivariate analysis identified INR (odds ratio (OR)=15.3, 95% CI 2.96-76.9, p=0.001) and PPI use (OR=6.41, 95% CI=1.16-35.7, p=0.033) to be independent risk factors for SBP. CONCLUSION: The use of PPIs in cirrhotic patients with ascites is independently associated with SBP in the Japanese clinical setting.

24828079|t|An antidepressant decreases CSF Abeta production in healthy individuals and in transgenic AD mice.
24828079|a|Serotonin signaling suppresses generation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in vitro and in animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We show that in an aged transgenic AD mouse model (APP/PS1 plaque-bearing mice), the antidepressant citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, decreased Abeta in brain interstitial fluid in a dose-dependent manner. Growth of individual amyloid plaques was assessed in plaque-bearing mice that were chronically administered citalopram. Citalopram arrested the growth of preexisting plaques and reduced the appearance of new plaques by 78%. In healthy human volunteers, citalopram's effects on Abeta production and Abeta concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were measured prospectively using stable isotope labeling kinetics, with CSF sampling during acute dosing of citalopram. Abeta production in CSF was slowed by 37% in the citalopram group compared to placebo. This change was associated with a 38% decrease in total CSF Abeta concentrations in the drug-treated group. The ability to safely decrease Abeta concentrations is potentially important as a preventive strategy for AD. This study demonstrates key target engagement for future AD prevention trials.

24828504|t|Early-onset formation of parenchymal plaque amyloid abrogates cerebral microvascular amyloid accumulation in transgenic mice.
24828504|a|The fibrillar assembly and deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) protein, a key pathology of Alzheimer disease, can occur in the form of parenchymal amyloid plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Familial forms of CAA exist in the absence of appreciable parenchymal amyloid pathology. The molecular interplay between parenchymal amyloid plaques and CAA is unclear. Here we investigated how early-onset parenchymal amyloid plaques impact the development of microvascular amyloid in transgenic mice. Tg-5xFAD mice, which produce non-mutated human Abeta and develop early-onset parenchymal amyloid plaques, were bred to Tg-SwDI mice, which produce familial CAA mutant human Abeta and develop cerebral microvascular amyloid. The bigenic mice presented with an elevated accumulation of Abeta and fibrillar amyloid in the brain compared with either single transgenic line. Tg-SwDI/Tg-5xFAD mice were devoid of microvascular amyloid, the prominent pathology of Tg-SwDI mice, but exhibited larger parenchymal amyloid plaques compared with Tg-5xFAD mice. The larger parenchymal amyloid deposits were associated with a higher loss of cortical neurons and elevated activated microglia in the bigenic Tg-SwDI/Tg-5xFAD mice. The periphery of parenchymal amyloid plaques was largely composed of CAA mutant Abeta. Non-mutated Abeta fibril seeds promoted CAA mutant Abeta fibril formation in vitro. Further, intrahippocampal administration of biotin-labeled CAA mutant Abeta peptide accumulated on and adjacent to pre-existing parenchymal amyloid plaques in Tg-5xFAD mice. These findings indicate that early-onset parenchymal amyloid plaques can serve as a scaffold to capture CAA mutant Abeta peptides and prevent their accumulation in cerebral microvessels.

24828645|t|Suppression of InsP3 receptor-mediated Ca2+ signaling alleviates mutant presenilin-linked familial Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.
24828645|a|Exaggerated intracellular Ca(2+) signaling is a robust proximal phenotype observed in cells expressing familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD)-causing mutant presenilins (PSs). The mechanisms that underlie this phenotype are controversial and their in vivo relevance for AD pathogenesis is unknown. Here, we used a genetic approach to identify the mechanisms involved and to evaluate their role in the etiology of AD in two FAD mouse models. Genetic reduction of the type 1 inositol trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R1) by 50% normalized exaggerated Ca(2+) signaling observed in cortical and hippocampal neurons in both animal models. In PS1M146V knock-in mice, reduced InsP3R1 expression restored normal ryanodine receptor and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-dependent gene expression and rescued aberrant hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). In 3xTg mice, reduced InsP3R1 expression profoundly attenuated amyloid beta accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation and rescued hippocampal LTP and memory deficits. These results indicate that exaggerated Ca(2+) signaling, which is associated with FAD PS, is mediated by InsP3R and contributes to disease pathogenesis in vivo. Targeting the InsP3 signaling pathway could be considered a potential therapeutic strategy for patients harboring mutations in PS linked to AD.

24831240|t|When amyloids become prions.
24831240|a|The conformational diseases, linked to protein aggregation into amyloid conformations, range from non-infectious neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer disease (AD), to highly infectious ones, such as human transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). They are commonly known as prion diseases. However, since all amyloids could be considered prions (from those involved in cell-to-cell transmission to those responsible for real neuronal invasion), it is necessary to find an underlying cause of the different capacity to infect that each of the proteins prone to form amyloids has. As proposed here, both the intrinsic cytotoxicity and the number of nuclei of aggregation per cell could be key factors in this transmission capacity of each amyloid.

24831823|t|Neuronal driven pre-plaque inflammation in a transgenic rat model of Alzheimer's disease.
24831823|a|Chronic brain inflammation is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is classically attributed to amyloid plaque deposition. However, whether the amyloid pathology can trigger early inflammatory processes before plaque deposition remains a matter of debate. To address the possibility that a pre-plaque inflammatory process occurs, we investigated the status of neuronal, astrocytic, and microglial markers in pre- and post-amyloid plaque stages in a novel transgenic rat model of an AD-like amyloid pathology (McGill-R-Thy1-APP). In this model, we found a marked upregulation of several classical inflammatory markers such as COX-2, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and fractalkine (CX3CL1) in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Interestingly, many of these markers were highly expressed in amyloid beta-burdened neurons. Activated astrocytes and microglia were associated with these Abeta-burdened neurons. These findings confirm the occurrence of a proinflammatory process preceding amyloid plaque deposition and suggest that Abeta-burdened neurons play a crucial role in initiating inflammation in AD.

24832819|t|The role of endoplasmic reticulum in amyloid precursor protein processing and trafficking: implications for Alzheimer's disease.
24832819|a|The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the principal organelle responsible for the proper folding/processing of nascent proteins and perturbed ER function leads to a state known as ER stress. Mammalian cells try to overcome ER stress through a set of protein signaling pathways and transcription factors termed the unfolded protein response (UPR). However, under unresolvable ER stress conditions, the UPR is hyperactivated inducing cell dysfunction and death. The accumulation of misfolded proteins in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients suggests that alterations in ER homeostasis might be implicated in the neurodegenerative events that characterize this disorder. This review discusses the involvement of ER stress in the pathogenesis of AD, focusing the processing and trafficking of the AD-related amyloid precursor protein (APP) during disease development. The potential role of ER as a therapeutic target in AD will also be debated.

24835997|t|APP homodimers transduce an amyloid-beta-mediated increase in release probability at excitatory synapses.
24835997|a|Accumulation of amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta), the proteolytic products of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), induces a variety of synaptic dysfunctions ranging from hyperactivity to depression that are thought to cause cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. While depression of synaptic transmission has been extensively studied, the mechanisms underlying synaptic hyperactivity remain unknown. Here, we show that Abeta40 monomers and dimers augment release probability through local fine-tuning of APP-APP interactions at excitatory hippocampal boutons. Abeta40 binds to the APP, increases the APP homodimer fraction at the plasma membrane, and promotes APP-APP interactions. The APP activation induces structural rearrangements in the APP/Gi/o-protein complex, boosting presynaptic calcium flux and vesicle release. The APP growth-factor-like domain (GFLD) mediates APP-APP conformational changes and presynaptic enhancement. Thus, the APP homodimer constitutes a presynaptic receptor that transduces signal from Abeta40 to glutamate release. Excessive APP activation may initiate a positive feedback loop, contributing to hippocampal hyperactivity in Alzheimer's disease.

24836237|t|Search for top-quark partners with charge 5/3 in the same-sign dilepton final state.
24836237|a|A search for the production of heavy partners of the top quark with charge 5/3 is performed in events with a pair of same-sign leptons. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.5 fb(-1) and was collected at sqrt[s] = 8 TeV by the CMS experiment. No significant excess is observed in the data above the expected background, and the existence of top-quark partners with masses below 800 GeV is excluded at a 95% confidence level, assuming they decay exclusively to tW. This is the first limit on these particles from the LHC, and it is significantly more restrictive than previous limits.

24836238|t|Search for flavor-changing neutral currents in top-quark decays t   Zq in pp collisions at sqrt[s] = 8 TeV.
24836238|a|A search for flavor-changing neutral currents in top-quark decays t   Zq is performed in events produced from the decay chain tt   Zq+Wb, where both vector bosons decay leptonically, producing a final state with three leptons (electrons or muons). A data set collected with the CMS detector at the LHC is used, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb(-1) of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. No excess is seen in the observed number of events relative to the standard model prediction; thus, no evidence for flavor-changing neutral currents in top-quark decays is found. A combination with a previous search at 7 TeV excludes a t   Zq branching fraction greater than 0.05% at the 95% confidence level.

24836270|t|Proceedings from the first Global Summit on Radiological Quality and Safety.
24836270|a|The ACR, the European Society of Radiology, and the International Society of Radiology held the first joint Global Summit on Radiological Quality and Safety in May 2013. The program was divided into 3 day-long themes: appropriateness of imaging, radiation protection/infrastructure, and quality and safety. Participants came from global organizations, including the International Atomic Energy Agency, the World Health Organization, and other institutions; industry and patient advocacy groups with an interest in imaging were also represented. The goal was to exchange ideas and solutions and share concerns to arrive at a better and more uniform approach to quality and safety. Participants were asked to use the information presented to develop strategies and tactics to harmonize and promote best practices worldwide. These strategies were summarized at the conclusion of the meeting.

24837743|t|Neophobia, NQO1 and SIRT1 as premorbid and prodromal indicators of AD in 3xTg-AD mice.
24837743|a|Increased oxidative stress seems to be a key factor underlying natural processes of aging, but also to occur prior to neuropathological hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases. The present work studied the temporal variation of three key antioxidant enzymes in cortex and hippocampus during the development of behavioral and cognitive symptoms in 3xTg-AD mice, and as compared to age-matched controls. At 2 months of age, when no intraneuronal Abeta immunoreactivity has been reported, increased neophobia shown as a delayed and reduced rearing, evidenced the onset of BPSD-like symptoms at premorbid stages of disease. In these animals, NQO1 was found increased in both the hippocampus (800%) and cortex (400%) and progressively diminished at older ages. SOD1 was increased in the hippocampus at 4 months of age, when neuronal Abeta accumulation has been established. These hippocampal increases of antioxidants before the prodromal emergence of cognitive symptoms support their role as defense mechanisms. SIRT1 levels showed opposite age-dependent changes in cortex (increase) and hippocampus (decrease) relative to controls. Prodromal cognitive deficits emerged at 6 months of age, concomitantly to cortical overexpression of SIRT1 but down-regulation of NQO1 and SIRT1 in the hippocampus, suggesting inadequate antioxidative protection to prevent or delay the subjacent neuronal damage. The present data further support the link between oxidative status and the anxious profile. Their crosstalk may underline AD-pathological mechanisms that may lead to deranged physiology and selective neuronal degeneration. It also points out increased neophobia and high expression of NQO1 among the first indicators of disease in the 3xTg-AD mice.

24838531|t|Impact of amyloid beta25-35 on membrane stability, energy metabolism, and antioxidant enzymes in erythrocytes.
24838531|a|Amyloid beta25-35 (Abeta25-35) represents a neurotoxic fragment of Abeta1-40 or Abeta1-42, and is implicated in the progressive neurodegeneration in cases of the Alzheimer disease (AD). Amyloid beta25-35 was shown to lyse rat erythrocytes (RBCs) of all ages, and the extent of the RBC toxicity is directly correlated with Abeta25-35 concentration and cell age. Activities of glycolytic, antioxidant, and Na(+)/K(+)-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) enzymes, in vivo, are significantly decreased in older RBCs as compared to the young RBCs. In vitro, Abeta25-35 reduced activities of hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione transferase and increased Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity; these effects are significantly greater in aged RBCs as compared to those of the younger cells. The diminution in activity of certain enzymes may determine the life span of the RBCs in vivo and may be relevant to the human AD; higher sensitivity of older RBCs to Abeta25-35 toxicity may contribute to the ultimate death of the RBCs in patients with AD.

24839743|t|Social marketing campaigns that promote condom use among MSM: a literature review.
24839743|a|The turn of the century has seen an increase in reported cases of sexually transmitted infections including the human immunodeficiency virus, particularly in groups of men who have sex with men. Both internationally and in New Zealand the implementation of social marketing human immunodeficiency virus prevention programmes are identified as appropriate mechanisms to promote condom use in men who have sex with men. This paper presents a review of the literature on research-based social marketing initiatives designed to decrease sexually transmitted infections, including the human immunodeficiency virus, through an increase in condom use by men who have sex with men. Eleven quality assured articles met the inclusion criteria and were consequently included in the review. The review presented here strongly supports the utilisation of behaviourally based social marketing campaigns to increase condom use in men who have sex with men. Nurses are frequently first point of contact for consumers of health services. As such they need to have a sound understanding of not only Get it On!, a New Zealand social marketing campaign designed to promote condom use, but also about existing international campaigns. Nurses should also know about social marketing principles if they are to effect positive changes in condom use and address the complex challenges inherent in tackling increased rates of sexually transmitted infections, including the human immunodeficiency virus.

24840308|t|Secreted amyloid beta-proteins in a cell culture model include N-terminally extended peptides that impair synaptic plasticity.
24840308|a|Evidence for a central role of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) in the genesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has led to advanced human trials of Abeta-lowering agents. The "amyloid hypothesis" of AD postulates deleterious effects of small, soluble forms of Abeta on synaptic form and function. Because selectively targeting synaptotoxic forms of soluble Abeta could be therapeutically advantageous, it is important to understand the full range of soluble Abeta derivatives. We previously described a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line (7PA2 cells) that stably expresses mutant human amyloid precursor protein (APP). Here, we extend this work by purifying an sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-stable, ~8 kDa Abeta species from the 7PA2 medium. Mass spectrometry confirmed its identity as a noncovalently bonded Abeta40 homodimer that impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in vivo. We further report the detection of Abeta-containing fragments of APP in the 7PA2 medium that extend N-terminal from Asp1 of Abeta. These N-terminally extended Abeta-containing monomeric fragments are distinct from soluble Abeta oligomers formed from Abeta1-40/42 monomers and are bioactive synaptotoxins secreted by 7PA2 cells. Importantly, decreasing beta-secretase processing of APP elevated these alternative synaptotoxic APP fragments. We conclude that certain synaptotoxic Abeta-containing species can arise from APP processing events N-terminal to the classical beta-secretase cleavage site.

24841744|t|Amyloid-beta accumulation, neurogenesis, behavior, and the age of rats.
24841744|a|The goals of this research were to describe age-related changes in brain biochemistry and behavior, and the relationships between them. The chronological ages of greatest change are particularly important for targeting interventions. In this experiment, 36 Fischer 344/Brown-Norway rats (3, 12, 20, and 30 months old) were trained in lever boxes on temporal discrimination tasks. The greatest response rate decrease and response pattern change occurred between 12 and 20 months. The biochemical results showed that amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta40 and Abeta42) increased with age. The endothelial expression of the Abeta influx transporter (RAGE) also increased, and the expression of Abeta efflux transporter (LPR-1) decreased, with age. The greatest change in the biochemical measures also were between 12 and 20 months. Twenty additional rats were analyzed for stem cell proliferation, and neurogenesis decreased with age, particularly between about 12 and 20 months. These early changes in brain, biochemistry, and behavior provide opportunity for new therapies or prophylaxis.

24842955|t|Mass spectrometry-based candidate reference measurement procedure for quantification of amyloid-beta in cerebrospinal fluid.
24842955|a|BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-beta (Abeta42) is a well-established biomarker for Alzheimer disease. Several immunoassays for Abeta42 exist but differ in absolute concentrations and may suffer from matrix interference, thereby hampering interlaboratory comparisons and the use of general cutoff levels. Together with the IFCC Working Group on CSF Proteins, we developed a candidate reference measurement procedure (RMP) for Abeta42. METHODS: The antibody-independent candidate RMP was based on solid-phase extraction and isotope-dilution LC-MS/MS. The candidate RMP used 2 differently stable isotope-labeled Abeta42 peptides for calibration in human CSF, an important aspect since there was no analyte-free matrix available. Because no CSF certified reference material (CRM) exists, we used a nonlabeled Abeta42 standard, the concentration of which was determined by amino acid analysis. We performed measurements on a high-resolution quadrupole-Orbitrap hybrid instrument. The results were compared with a method run in a second laboratory with triple quadrupole instrumentation. RESULTS: The candidate RMP allowed quantification of CSF Abeta42 from 150 to 4000 pg/mL. Validation of the method showed a recovery of 100% (15%), intraassay and interassay imprecision of 5.0% and 6.4%, respectively, and an expanded uncertainty of 15.7%. No analytical interferences or carryover were detected. CONCLUSIONS: This method will help set the value of CSF Abeta42 in a CRM, which could be used to harmonize Abeta42 assays and facilitate the introduction of general cutoff concentrations for CSF Abeta42 in clinical trials and practice.

24844149|t|Nuclear 82-kDa choline acetyltransferase decreases amyloidogenic APP metabolism in neurons from APP/PS1 transgenic mice.
24844149|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is associated with increased amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) to beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta), cholinergic neuron loss with decreased choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity, and cognitive dysfunction. Both 69-kDa ChAT and 82-kDa ChAT are expressed in cholinergic neurons in human brain and spinal cord with 82-kDa ChAT localized predominantly to neuronal nuclei, suggesting potential alternative functional roles for the enzyme. By gene microarray analysis, we found that 82-kDa ChAT-expressing IMR32 neural cells have altered expression of genes involved in diverse cellular functions. Importantly, genes for several proteins that regulate APP processing along amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic pathways are differentially expressed in 82-kDa ChAT-containing cells. The predicted net effect based on observed changes in expression patterns of these genes would be decreased amyloidogenic APP processing with decreased Abeta production. This functional outcome was verified experimentally as a significant decrease in BACE1 protein levels and activity and a concomitant reduction in the release of endogenous Abeta1-42 from neurons cultured from brains of AD-model APP/PS1 transgenic mice. The expression of 82-kDa ChAT in neurons increased levels of GGA3, which is involved in trafficking BACE1 to lysosomes for degradation. shRNA-induced decreases in GGA3 protein levels attenuated the 82-kDa ChAT-mediated decreases in BACE1 protein and activity and Abeta1-42 release. Evidence that 82-kDa ChAT can enhance GGA3 gene expression is shown by enhanced GGA3 gene promoter activity in SN56 neural cells expressing this ChAT protein. These studies indicate a novel relationship between cholinergic neurons and APP processing, with 82-kDa ChAT acting as a negative regulator of Abeta production. This decreased formation of Abeta could result in protection for cholinergic neurons, as well as protection of other cells in the vicinity that are sensitive to increased levels of Abeta. Decreasing levels of 82-kDa ChAT due to increasing age or neurodegeneration could alter the balance towards increasing Abeta production, with this potentiating the decline in function of cholinergic neurons.

24844197|t|Developmental gene expression provides clues to relationships between sponge and eumetazoan body plans.
24844197|a|Elucidation of macroevolutionary transitions between diverse animal body plans remains a major challenge in evolutionary biology. We address the sponge-eumetazoan transition by analyzing expression of a broad range of eumetazoan developmental regulatory genes in Sycon ciliatum (Calcispongiae). Here we show that many members of surprisingly numerous Wnt and Tgfbeta gene families are expressed higher or uniquely in the adult apical end and the larval posterior end. Genes involved in formation of the eumetazoan endomesoderm, such as beta-catenin, Brachyury and Gata, as well as germline markers Vasa and Pl10, are expressed during formation and maintenance of choanoderm, the feeding epithelium of sponges. Similarity in developmental gene expression between sponges and eumetazoans, especially cnidarians, is consistent with Haeckel's view that body plans of sponges and cnidarians are homologous. These results provide a framework for further studies aimed at deciphering ancestral developmental regulatory networks and their modifications during animal body plans evolution.

24844685|t|Amyloid plaque-independent deficit of early postnatal visual cortical plasticity in the 5XFAD transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease.
24844685|a|Autosomal dominant forms of familial Alzheimer's disease are linked to an aberrant processing of the amyloid-beta protein precursor, which results in an increased production of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides that first form oligomers and eventually aggregate in the form of extracellular amyloid plaques in the brain. The accumulation of Abeta peptides oligomers seems to correlate with alterations of synaptic transmission in experimental models of Alzheimer's disease. Whether Abeta aggregation disrupts synaptic function independently of amyloid plaques deposition still needs further research. Here we report an amyloid plaque-independent deficit of neuronal plasticity after short-term sensory deprivation in the visual system of 5XFAD mice.

24844686|t|Previously unrecognized missense mutation E126K of PSEN2 segregates with early onset Alzheimer's disease in a family.
24844686|a|Mutations in the gene PSEN2 are a rare cause of early onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD). PSEN2 sequence variants are often only found in one patient and pathogenicity cannot be formally documented. Here we describe a previously unrecognized sequence change (c.376G>A) in PSEN2 in an EOAD patient and her likewise affected mother. This change results in the exchange of amino acid glutamic acid (E) by lysine (K) at position 126 of the protein (p.E126K). Pathogenicity of the mutation is shown by segregation with disease, evolutionary conservation of E126, and in silico analysis of the mutation.

24845186|t|Physical exercise neuroprotects ovariectomized 3xTg-AD mice through BDNF mechanisms.
24845186|a|Postmenopausal women may be more vulnerable to cognitive loss and Alzheimer's disease (AD) than premenopausal women because of their deficiency in estrogens, in addition to their usually older age. Aerobic physical exercise has been proposed as a therapeutic approach for maintaining health and well-being in postmenopausal women, and for improving brain health and plasticity in populations at high risk for AD. To study the neuroprotective mechanisms of physical exercise in a postmenopausal animal model, we submitted previously ovariectomized, six-month old non-transgenic and 3xTg-AD mice to three months of voluntary exercise in a running wheel. At nine months of age, we observed lower grip strength and some exacerbation of the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD)-like involving active exploratory activities. A similar major cognitive impairment was observed of ovariectomized 3xTg-AD mice in comparison with sham-operated 3xTg-AD mice. A reduction of bodily fitness and lack of retention of memory were observed in the ovariectomized non-transgenic mice. Physical exercise protected against all deleterious behaviors and normalized learning and memory. It also protected against body frailty, as expected. Analyses of hippocampal key markers of antioxidant and neuroplasticity signaling pathways, showed that ovariectomy impairs the activation of CREB through physical exercise. Furthermore, molecular and behavioral correlates suggested a central role of BDNF in the neuroprotection mediated by physical exercise therapy against apathy and memory loss induced by ovariectomy and the AD-genotype.

24845621|t|Sleep deficits in mild cognitive impairment are related to increased levels of plasma amyloid-beta and cortical thinning.
24845621|a|Evidence suggests that amyloid-beta (Abeta) depositions parallel sleep deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it remains unknown whether impaired sleep and changes in plasma Abeta levels are related in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) subjects, and whether both markers are further associated with cortical thinning in canonical AD regions. To jointly address this issue, we investigated relationships between changes in physiological sleep and plasma Abeta concentrations in 21 healthy old (HO) adults and 21 aMCI subjects, and further assessed whether these two factors were associated with cortical loss in each group. aMCI, but not HO subjects, showed significant relationships between disrupted slow-wave sleep (SWS) and increased plasma levels of Abeta42. We also found that shortened rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep in aMCI correlated with thinning of the posterior cingulate, precuneus, and postcentral gyrus; whereas higher levels of Abeta40 and Abeta42 accounted for grey matter (GM) loss of posterior cingulate and entorhinal cortex, respectively. These results support preliminary relationships between Abeta burden and altered sleep physiology observed in animal models of AD amyloidosis, and provide precise cortical correlates of these changes in older adults with aMCI. Taken together, these findings open new research avenues on the combined role of sleep, peripheral Abeta levels and cortical integrity in tracking the progression from normal aging to early neurodegeneration.

24846616|t|Memantine improves spatial learning and memory impairments by regulating NGF signaling in APP/PS1 transgenic mice.
24846616|a|Memantine (MEM) is used for improving the cognitive impairments of the patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) by multiple neuroprotective mechanisms. However, it is still not clear whether nerve growth factor (NGF) signaling is involved in the mechanisms of MEM. The present study investigated the neuroprotective effects of MEM treatment on the cognitive performance and amyloidosis in APP/PS1 transgenic mice, and disclosed the NGF-related mechanism of MEM. We found that MEM treatment improved the cognitive performance by decreasing the escape latency and path length in the navigation test, by shortening the duration in target quadrant and reducing the frequency to pass through the target in probe trial, and by prolonging the latency and decreasing the frequencies of entering the dark compartment in passive avoidance test. The over-expressions of Abeta(1-42) and amyloid precursor protein (APP) were also decreased in the brains of APP/PS1 mice. Interestingly, MEM treatment improved the decreased NGF levels in APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, NGF/TrkA signaling was activated by increasing the phosphorylation levels of tyrosine kinase (TrkA), proto-oncogene serine/threonine-protein kinase, Raf1 (c-Raf), extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK)1/2 and cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) after MEM treatment. Simultaneously, MEM also inhibited NGF/p75(NTR) signaling via decreasing the cleavage substrate of p75(NTR), increasing the JNK2 phosphorylation and decreasing the levels of p53 and cleaved-caspase 3. Therefore, the dual-regulation on NGF signaling was attributed to the improvements of cognitive deficits and Abeta depositions in APP/PS1 mice. In conclusion, MEM treatment activated the NGF/TrkA signaling, and inhibited the p75(NTR) signaling in APP/PS1 mice to ameliorate the behavioral deficits and amyloidosis, indicating that NGF signaling was a new potential target of MEM treatment for AD therapy.

24846973|t|[The effect of DNA methylation on beta-amyloid accumulation in Alzheimer's disease].
24846973|a|DNA methylation is the most intensively studied mechanism for epigenetic gene regulation. The functions of DNA methylation have recently drawn wide attention for investigation into the etiology of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has been well established that beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation leads to the formation of senile plaques, which is a hallmark of AD pathology. Aggregation of Abeta induces neurotoxicities manifested by apoptosis, neuroin-flammation, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction etc., which consequently provoke the pathological progression of AD. Previous studies have demonstrated that DNA methylation plays an important role in regulating genes associated with the production, clearance and aggregation of Abeta. DNA methylation is a reversible process, making it a promising target for AD therapeutics. Further studies of DNA methylation in the initiation and progression of AD would pave the road to explore improved approaches to treat this disease. In this review, we summarize the involvement of DNA methylation in Abeta accumulation as well as the associated pathological alterations during the initiation and progression of AD, which would help to fully appreciate the molecular basis of AD.

24848686|t|An update of the International Society of Sexual Medicine's guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of premature ejaculation (PE).
24848686|a|INTRODUCTION: In 2009, the International Society for Sexual Medicine (ISSM) convened a select panel of experts to develop an evidence-based set of guidelines for patients suffering from lifelong premature ejaculation (PE). That document reviewed definitions, etiology, impact on the patient and partner, assessment, and pharmacological, psychological, and combined treatments. It concluded by recognizing the continually evolving nature of clinical research and recommended a subsequent guideline review and revision every fourth year. Consistent with that recommendation, the ISSM organized a second multidisciplinary panel of experts in April 2013, which met for 2 days in Bangalore, India. This manuscript updates the previous guidelines and reports on the recommendations of the panel of experts. AIM: The aim of this study was to develop clearly worded, practical, evidenced-based recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of PE for family practice clinicians as well as sexual medicine experts. METHOD: A comprehensive literature review was performed. RESULTS: This article contains the report of the second ISSM PE Guidelines Committee. It offers a new unified definition of PE and updates the previous treatment recommendations. Brief assessment procedures are delineated, and validated diagnostic and treatment questionnaires are reviewed. Finally, the best practices treatment recommendations are presented to guide clinicians, both familiar and unfamiliar with PE, in facilitating treatment of their patients. CONCLUSION: Development of guidelines is an evolutionary process that continually reviews data and incorporates the best new research.

24849345|t|1alpha,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 reduces cerebral amyloid-beta accumulation and improves cognition in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.
24849345|a|We demonstrate a role of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in reducing cerebral soluble and insoluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides. Short-term treatment of two human amyloid precursor protein-expressing models, Tg2576 and TgCRND8 mice, with 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], the endogenous active ligand of VDR, resulted in higher brain P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and lower soluble Abeta levels, effects negated with coadministration of elacridar, a P-gp inhibitor. Long-term treatment of TgCRND8 mice with 1,25(OH)2D3 during the period of plaque formation reduced soluble and insoluble plaque-associated Abeta, particularly in the hippocampus in which the VDR is abundant and P-gp induction is greatest after 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment, and this led to improved conditioned fear memory. In mice fed a vitamin D-deficient diet, lower cerebral P-gp expression was observed, but levels were restored on replenishment with VDR ligands. The composite data suggest that the VDR is an important therapeutic target in the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

24849358|t|The systemic amyloid precursor transthyretin (TTR) behaves as a neuronal stress protein regulated by HSF1 in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells and APP23 Alzheimer's disease model mice.
24849358|a|Increased neuronal synthesis of transthyretin (TTR) may favorably impact on Alzheimer's disease (AD) because TTR has been shown to inhibit Abeta aggregation and detoxify cell-damaging conformers. The mechanism whereby hippocampal and cortical neurons from AD patients and APP23 AD model mice produce more TTR is unknown. We now show that TTR expression in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells, primary hippocampal neurons and the hippocampus of APP23 mice, is significantly enhanced by heat shock factor 1 (HSF1). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrated occupation of TTR promoter heat shock elements by HSF1 in APP23 hippocampi, primary murine hippocampal neurons, and SH-SY5Y cells, but not in mouse liver, cultured human hepatoma (HepG2) cells, or AC16 cultured human cardiomyocytes. Treating SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells with heat shock or the HSF1 stimulator celastrol increased TTR transcription in parallel with that of HSP40, HSP70, and HSP90. With both treatments, ChIP showed increased occupancy of heat shock elements in the TTR promoter by HSF1. In vivo celastrol increased the HSF1 ChIP signal in hippocampus but not in liver. Transfection of a human HSF1 construct into SH-SY5Y cells increased TTR transcription and protein production, which could be blocked by shHSF1 antisense. The effect is neuron specific. In cultured HepG2 cells, HSF1 was either suppressive or had no effect on TTR expression confirming the differential effects of HSF1 on TTR transcription in different cell types.

24849360|t|Anti-ApoE antibody given after plaque onset decreases Abeta accumulation and improves brain function in a mouse model of Abeta amyloidosis.
24849360|a|Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is the strongest known genetic risk factor for late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). It influences amyloid-beta (Abeta) clearance and aggregation, which likely contributes in large part to its role in AD pathogenesis. We recently found that HJ6.3, a monoclonal antibody against apoE, significantly reduced Abeta plaque load when given to APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 (APP/PS1) mice starting before the onset of plaque deposition. To determine whether the anti-apoE antibody HJ6.3 affects Abeta plaques, neuronal network function, and behavior in APP/PS1 mice after plaque onset, we administered HJ6.3 (10 mg/kg/week) or PBS intraperitoneally to 7-month-old APP/PS1 mice for 21 weeks. HJ6.3 mildly improved spatial learning performance in the water maze, restored resting-state functional connectivity, and modestly reduced brain Abeta plaque load. There was no effect of HJ6.3 on total plasma cholesterol or cerebral amyloid angiopathy. To investigate the underlying mechanisms of anti-apoE immunotherapy, HJ6.3 was applied to the brain cortical surface and amyloid deposition was followed over 2 weeks using in vivo imaging. Acute exposure to HJ6.3 affected the course of amyloid deposition in that it prevented the formation of new amyloid deposits, limited their growth, and was associated with occasional clearance of plaques, a process likely associated with direct binding to amyloid aggregates. Topical application of HJ6.3 for only 14 d also decreased the density of amyloid plaques assessed postmortem. Collectively, these studies suggest that anti-apoE antibodies have therapeutic potential when given before or after the onset of Abeta pathology.

24849361|t|Reversal of apoE4-driven brain pathology and behavioral deficits by bexarotene.
24849361|a|Apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4), the most prevalent genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), is less lipidated than its corresponding AD-benign form, apoE3, and it has been suggested that the pathological effects of apoE4 are mediated by lipid-related mechanisms. ATP-binding cassette transporters A1 and G1 (ABCA1 and ABCG1, respectively) are the most important apoE-lipidating proteins. The expression of these proteins, as well as that of apoE, is controlled by the transcription regulation retinoid X receptor (RXR)-liver X receptor (LXR) system. In the present study, we investigated the effects of the RXR agonist bexarotene on mRNA and protein levels of apoE, ABCA1, and ABCG1 in young, naive apoE3- and apoE4-targeted replacement mice and assessed the extent to which this reverses the apoE4-driven pathological phenotype. This investigation reveled that bexarotene increases the mRNA and protein levels of ABCA1 and ABCG1 in hippocampal neurons, but has no effect on the corresponding levels of apoE. These findings were associated with reversal of the lipidation deficiency of apoE4 and of the cognitive impairments of apoE4 mice in several tests. Furthermore, bexarotene reversed the apoE4-driven accumulation of Abeta42 and hyperphosphorylated tau in hippocampal neurons, as well as the apoE4-induced reduction in the levels of the presynaptic marker vesicular glutamatergic transporter 1 (VGluT1). In conclusion, the results show that treatment of apoE4 mice with the RXR agonist bexarotene reverses the apoE4-induced cognitive and neuronal impairments in vivo and suggest that this is due to reversal of the lipidation deficiency of apoE4. This puts forward the possibility that RXR activation and increased levels of ABCA1 and ABCG1 could be useful in the treatment of human apoE4 carriers.

24849465|t|Anatomical variations of the anterior communicating artery complex: gender relationship.
24849465|a|PURPOSE: The anatomy of the anterior communicating artery complex plays a critical role in surgical treatment of anterior cerebral circulation aneurysms. A thorough description of vascular variations of the anterior communicating artery complex seems to be lacking. The aim of this study was to describe the anatomical variations of the anterior communicating artery complex. METHODS: The study group consisted of 411 subjects (52.31% women), without any intracranial pathologies, that had undergone head computed tomography angiography. We used maximum intensity projections, volume rendering and multi planar reconstructions to study and classify the anatomical variations of the anterior communicating and anterior cerebral arteries. RESULTS: Male subjects had a significantly higher prevalence of the typical anterior communicating artery complex (59.69 vs. 46.05%; p < 0.01). The aplastic anterior communicating artery (23.26 vs. 15.88%; p = 0.04) and triple A2 segment of the anterior cerebral artery (1.86 vs. 0.00%; p = 0.05) were more common in women than in men. CONCLUSION: Female subjects have a higher incidence of variations in the anterior communicating artery complex. There is a higher incidence of anterior communicating artery aplasia among women.

24849570|t|Altered amyloid precursor protein processing regulates glucose uptake and oxidation in cultured rodent myotubes.
24849570|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Impaired glucose uptake in skeletal muscle is an important contributor to glucose intolerance in type 2 diabetes. The aspartate protease, beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), a critical regulator of amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, modulates in vivo glucose disposal and insulin sensitivity in mice. Insulin-independent pathways to stimulate glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation may offer alternative therapeutic avenues for the treatment of diabetes. We therefore addressed whether BACE1 activity, via APP processing, in skeletal muscle modifies glucose uptake and oxidation independently of insulin. METHODS: Skeletal muscle cell lines were used to investigate the effects of BACE1 and alpha-secretase inhibition and BACE1 and APP overexpression on glucose uptake, GLUT4 cell surface translocation, glucose oxidation and cellular respiration. RESULTS: In the absence of insulin, reduction of BACE1 activity increased glucose uptake and oxidation, GLUT4myc cell surface translocation, and basal rate of oxygen consumption. In contrast, overexpressing BACE1 in C2C12 myotubes decreased glucose uptake, glucose oxidation and oxygen consumption rate. APP overexpression increased and alpha-secretase inhibition decreased glucose uptake in C2C12 myotubes. The increase in glucose uptake elicited by BACE1 inhibition is dependent on phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mimicked by soluble APPalpha (sAPPalpha). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Inhibition of muscle BACE1 activity increases insulin-independent, PI3K-dependent glucose uptake and cell surface translocation of GLUT4. As APP overexpression raises basal glucose uptake, and direct application of sAPPalpha increases PI3K-protein kinase B signalling and glucose uptake in myotubes, we suggest that alpha-secretase-dependent shedding of sAPPalpha regulates insulin-independent glucose uptake in skeletal muscle.

24849862|t|Advancing research diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease: the IWG-2 criteria.
24849862|a|In the past 8 years, both the International Working Group (IWG) and the US National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association have contributed criteria for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that better define clinical phenotypes and integrate biomarkers into the diagnostic process, covering the full staging of the disease. This Position Paper considers the strengths and limitations of the IWG research diagnostic criteria and proposes advances to improve the diagnostic framework. On the basis of these refinements, the diagnosis of AD can be simplified, requiring the presence of an appropriate clinical AD phenotype (typical or atypical) and a pathophysiological biomarker consistent with the presence of Alzheimer's pathology. We propose that downstream topographical biomarkers of the disease, such as volumetric MRI and fluorodeoxyglucose PET, might better serve in the measurement and monitoring of the course of disease. This paper also elaborates on the specific diagnostic criteria for atypical forms of AD, for mixed AD, and for the preclinical states of AD.

24852227|t|Understanding the cause of sporadic Alzheimer's disease.
24852227|a|The increasing prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and a lack of effective prevention or disease-modifying therapies are global challenges with devastating personal, social and economic consequences. The amyloid beta (Abeta) hypothesis posits that cerebral beta-amyloidosis is a critical early event in AD pathogenesis. However, failed clinical trials of Abeta-centric drug candidates have called this hypothesis into question. Whereas we acknowledge that the Abeta hypothesis is far from disproven, we here re-visit the links between Abeta, tau and neurodegeneration. We review the genetics, epidemiology and pathology of sporadic AD and give an updated account of what is currently known about the molecular pathogenesis of the disease.

24852598|t|New mouse model of Alzheimer's.
24852598|a|Amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) accumulation is a key characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD); therefore, mouse models of AD exhibiting Abeta pathology are valuable tools for unraveling disease mechanisms. However, the overexpression of Abeta precursor protein (APP) used in previous mouse models may cause Abeta-independent artifacts that influence data interpretation. To circumvent these problems, we used an APP knock-in (KI) strategy to introduce mutations to the mouse APP gene to develop a new generation of AD mouse models. These new models, termed APP(NL-F) and APP(NL-G-F), have endogenous APP levels and develop robust Abeta amyloidosis, which induce synaptic degeneration and memory impairments. Thus, we suggest that these novel APP KI mice will serve as important tools to elucidate molecular mechanisms of AD.

24852682|t|Cerebrospinal fluid beta-amyloid and phospho-tau biomarker interactions affecting brain structure in preclinical Alzheimer disease.
24852682|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationships between core cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and cortical thickness (CTh) in preclinical Alzheimer disease (AD). METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, normal controls (n = 145) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative underwent structural 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and lumbar puncture. CSF beta-amyloid1-42 (Abeta) and phospho-tau181p (p-tau) levels were measured by Luminex assays. Samples were dichotomized using published cutoffs (Abeta(+) /Abeta(-) and p-tau(+) /ptau(-)). CTh was measured by Freesurfer. CTh difference maps were derived from interaction and correlation analyses. Clusters from the interaction analysis were isolated to analyze the directionality of the interaction by analysis of covariance. RESULTS: We found a significant biomarker interaction between CSF Abeta and CSF p-tau levels affecting brain structure. Cortical atrophy only occurs in subjects with both Abeta(+) and p-tau(+). The stratified correlation analyses showed that the relationship between p-tau and CTh is modified by Abeta status and the relationship between Abeta and CTh is modified by p-tau status. p-Tau-dependent thinning was found in different cortical regions in Abeta(+) subjects but not in Abeta(-) subjects. Cortical thickening was related to decreasing CSF Abeta values in the absence of abnormal p-tau, but no correlations were found in p-tau(+) subjects. INTERPRETATION: Our data suggest that interactions between biomarkers in AD result in a 2-phase phenomenon of pathological cortical thickening associated with low CSF Abeta, followed by atrophy once CSF p-tau becomes abnormal. These interactions should be considered in clinical trials in preclinical AD, both when selecting patients and when using MRI as a surrogate marker of efficacy.

24852932|t|Relationship of mismatch repair proteins and survivin in colon polyps and carcinomas.
24852932|a|Mismatch repair genes (MMR) play an essential role in DNA repair. MMR mutations predominantly in MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and rarely in PMS1, may cause the production of abnormally short or inactivated proteins. The antiapoptotic protein survivin functions in the inhibition of apoptosis, regulation of cell division and also enhances angiogenesis. Both MMRP and survivin are considered to be powerful prognostic parameters. This study was designed to determine the relationship between MMRP and survivin in colon lesions. The study included 113 cases of colon carcinoma and 51 cases of colon polyps. Survivin expression and MMRP status were assessed by immunohistochemistry. In each section, expression, intensity of immunostaining and percentage of labeled cells were analyzed. In carcinomas, immunoreaction was detected in 100/113 cases for MLH1 (88.5%), 112/113 cases for MSH2 (99.1%), 110/113 cases for MSH6 (97.3%), and 103/113 cases for PMS2 (91.2%). Survivin was shown in 47/113 cases (41.6%). The statistical analysis confirmed a significant correlation between the expression of MMRP and survivin in the assessed parameters. All 51 polyp samples were positive for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2. Only 8 of those (15.7%) were positive for survivin. Statistically significant differences were observed between the expression of MMRP and survivin. In conclusion, this study revealed that MMRP may suppress the antiapoptotic function of survivin through p53 inactivation of its promoter in grade 1 and grade 2 colon carcinomas.

24853936|t|The intersection of amyloid beta and tau at synapses in Alzheimer's disease.
24853936|a|The collapse of neural networks important for memory and cognition, including death of neurons and degeneration of synapses, causes the debilitating dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We suggest that synaptic changes are central to the disease process. Amyloid beta and tau form fibrillar lesions that are the classical hallmarks of AD. Recent data indicate that both molecules may have normal roles at the synapse, and that the accumulation of soluble toxic forms of the proteins at the synapse may be on the critical path to neurodegeneration. Further, the march of neurofibrillary tangles through brain circuits appears to take advantage of recently described mechanisms of transsynaptic spread of pathological forms of tau. These two key phenomena, synapse loss and the spread of pathology through the brain via synapses, make it critical to understand the physiological and pathological roles of amyloid beta and tau at the synapse.

24854439|t|Ginsenoside Rh2 promotes nonamyloidgenic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein via a cholesterol-dependent pathway.
24854439|a|Ginsenoside Rh2 (Rh2) is a ginseng derivative used in Chinese traditional medicine. We investigated whether Rh2 can help prevent Alzheimer's disease symptoms and examined underlying mechanisms. We injected Rh2 into tg2576 Alzheimer's disease model mice and looked for behavioral improvement and senile plaque reduction in brain slices. We measured amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism species changes, amyloid beta40 and 42 levels and beta, gamma secretase activity in primary hippocampal neurons. By living cell staining, we detected surface and endocytosed APP. We also measured cholesterol and lipid rafts in primary neurons. Rh2 treatment significantly improved learning and memory performance at 14 months of age; it also reduced brain senile plaques at this age. Based on in vitro experiments, we found that Rh2 treatment increased soluble APPalpha (sAPPalpha) levels, increased CTFalpha/beta ratios, and reduced amyloid beta 40 and 42 concentrations. Surface APP levels dramatically increased. Based on living cell staining, we found that Rh2 inhibited APP endocytosis. Based on lipid removal and reload experiments, we found that Rh2 can modulate APP by reducing cholesterol and lipid raft levels. We concluded that Rh2 improves learning and memory function in Alzheimer's disease model mice, and that this improvement is accomplished by reducing amyloid beta secretion and APP endocytosis, which in turn is achieved by reducing cholesterol and lipid raft concentrations.

24854788|t|The amyloid state and its association with protein misfolding diseases.
24854788|a|The phenomenon of protein aggregation and amyloid formation has become the subject of rapidly increasing research activities across a wide range of scientific disciplines. Such activities have been stimulated by the association of amyloid deposition with a range of debilitating medical disorders, from Alzheimer's disease to type II diabetes, many of which are major threats to human health and welfare in the modern world. It has become clear, however, that the ability to form the amyloid state is more general than previously imagined, and that its study can provide unique insights into the nature of the functional forms of peptides and proteins, as well as understanding the means by which protein homeostasis can be maintained and protein metastasis avoided.

24855110|a|The recognition of the serious health-damaging effects of tobacco smoke exposure has initiated several preventive programmes on the national and international levels worldwide. In the last decade, a considerable decrease in the prevalence of active smoking was observed in Denmark, changing the country from a poor to a favourable position in comparison to other EU countries. However, second-hand tobacco smoke exposure, especially in homes, still ranks Denmark among the problematic countries in Europe. This poorly recognised and studied discrepancy calls for further research and effective targeted interventions on population level.

24855651|t|Novel zinc-binding site in the E2 domain regulates amyloid precursor-like protein 1 (APLP1) oligomerization.
24855651|a|The amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the APP-like proteins 1 and 2 (APLP1 and APLP2) are a family of multidomain transmembrane proteins possessing homo- and heterotypic contact sites in their ectodomains. We previously reported that divalent metal ions dictate the conformation of the extracellular APP E2 domain (Dahms, S. O., Konnig, I., Roeser, D., Guhrs, K.-H., Mayer, M. C., Kaden, D., Multhaup, G., and Than, M. E. (2012) J. Mol. Biol. 416, 438-452), but unresolved is the nature and functional importance of metal ion binding to APLP1 and APLP2. We found here that zinc ions bound to APP and APLP1 E2 domains and mediated their oligomerization, whereas the APLP2 E2 domain interacted more weakly with zinc possessing a less surface-exposed zinc-binding site, and stayed monomeric. Copper ions bound to E2 domains of all three proteins. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analyses examined the effect of metal ion binding to APP and APLPs in the cellular context in real time. Zinc ions specifically induced APP and APLP1 oligomerization and forced APLP1 into multimeric clusters at the plasma membrane consistent with zinc concentrations in the blood and brain. The observed effects were mediated by a novel zinc-binding site within the APLP1 E2 domain as APLP1 deletion mutants revealed. Based upon its cellular localization and its dominant response to zinc ions, APLP1 is mainly affected by extracellular zinc among the APP family proteins. We conclude that zinc binding and APP/APLP oligomerization are intimately linked, and we propose that this represents a novel mechanism for regulating APP/APLP protein function at the molecular level.

24855834|t|Acorus tatarinowii Schott extract protects PC12 cells from amyloid-beta induced neurotoxicity.
24855834|a|Amyloid-beta induced neurotoxicity has been identified as a major cause of Alzheimer's disease. Acorus tatarinowii Schott is one of the most frequently used Chinese herbs for Alzheimer's disease treatment. However, the effects of Acorus tatarinowii Schott on amyloid-beta mediated nerve cell damage remains unknown. In the present study, neuronal differentiated PC12 cells were used as a model to evaluate the effects of A. tatarinowii Schott extract (ATSE) against Abeta25-35 induced neurotoxicity. The results showed pretreatment with ATSE significantly protected PC12 cells from Abeta25-35 induced cell death, lactate dehydrogenase release, DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction and cytochrome c release from mitochondria. In addition, pretreatment with ATSE also significantly inhibited Abeta25-35 induced caspase-3 activation and reactive oxygen species generation in PC12 cells. These observations suggested that ATSE protects PC12 cells from amyloid-beta induced neurotoxicity.

24856688|t|Measurements of tt spin correlations and top-quark polarization using dilepton final states in pp collisions at sqrt[s]=7  TeV.
24856688|a|Spin correlations and polarization in the top quark-antiquark system are measured using dilepton final states produced in pp collisions at the LHC at sqrt[s]=7  TeV. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 5.0  fb(-1) collected with the CMS detector. The measurements are performed using events with two oppositely charged leptons (electrons or muons), a significant imbalance in transverse momentum, and two or more jets, where at least one of the jets is identified as originating from a b quark. The spin correlations and polarization are measured through asymmetries in angular distributions of the two selected leptons, unfolded to the parton level. All measurements are found to be in agreement with predictions of the standard model.

24856820|t|Direct observations of amyloid beta self-assembly in live cells provide insights into differences in the kinetics of Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) aggregation.
24856820|a|Insight into how amyloid beta (Abeta) aggregation occurs in vivo is vital for understanding the molecular pathways that underlie Alzheimer's disease and requires new techniques that provide detailed kinetic and mechanistic information. Using noninvasive fluorescence lifetime recordings, we imaged the formation of Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) aggregates in live cells. For both peptides, the cellular uptake via endocytosis is rapid and spontaneous. They are then retained in lysosomes, where their accumulation leads to aggregation. The kinetics of Abeta(1-42) aggregation are considerably faster than those of Abeta(1-40) and, unlike those of the latter peptide, show no detectable lag phase. We used superresolution fluorescence imaging to examine the resulting aggregates and could observe compact amyloid structures, likely because of spatial confinement within cellular compartments. Taken together, these findings provide clues as to how Abeta aggregation may occur within neurons.

24857343|t|Interactions of a water-soluble fullerene derivative with amyloid-beta protofibrils: dynamics, binding mechanism, and the resulting salt-bridge disruption.
24857343|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with the pathological self-assembly of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides into beta-sheet-rich oligomers and insoluble amyloid fibrils. Experimental studies reported that 1,2-(dimethoxymethano)fullerene (DMF), a water-soluble fullerene derivative, inhibits strongly Abeta peptide aggregation at the early stage. However, the interaction and binding mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, we have investigated the detailed interaction of a DMF molecule with a fibrillar hexamer of full-length Abeta42 and the resulting structural alterations by performing multiple all-atom explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Starting from different initial states with a minimum distance of 2 nm between the DMF and the Abeta protofibril, our MD simulations show that the DMF binds to the Abeta protofibril via both slow and fast binding processes. Three dominant binding sites are identified: the central hydrophobic core (CHC) site (17LVFFA21), the turn site (27NKGAI31), and the C-terminal beta-sheet site consisting of the smallest side-chain residue glycine and hydrophobic residues (31IIGLMVGGVVI41). Binding energy analyses reveal the importance of pi-stacking interactions, especially in the CHC site, hydrophobic interactions, and curvature matching. Strikingly, we find that the binding of DMF to the turn region can disrupt the D23-K28 salt-bridge that is important for the Abeta fibrillation. These results provide molecular insight into the binding mechanism of fullerene to Abeta protofibrils and offer new routes for the therapeutic drug design using fullerene derivatives against AD.

24857657|t|HuD regulates coding and noncoding RNA to induce APP Abeta processing.
24857657|a|The primarily neuronal RNA-binding protein HuD is implicated in learning and memory. Here, we report the identification of several HuD target transcripts linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. HuD interacted with the 3' UTRs of APP mRNA (encoding amyloid precursor protein) and BACE1 mRNA (encoding beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1) and increased the half-lives of these mRNAs. HuD also associated with and stabilized the long noncoding (lnc)RNA BACE1AS, which partly complements BACE1 mRNA and enhances BACE1 expression. Consistent with HuD promoting production of APP and APP-cleaving enzyme, the levels of APP, BACE1, BACE1AS, and Abeta were higher in the brain of HuD-overexpressing mice. Importantly, cortex (superior temporal gyrus) from patients with AD displayed significantly higher levels of HuD and, accordingly, elevated APP, BACE1, BACE1AS, and Abeta than did cortical tissue from healthy age-matched individuals. We propose that HuD jointly promotes the production of APP and the cleavage of its amyloidogenic fragment, Abeta.

24857774|t|AlphaLISA-based high-throughput screening assay to measure levels of soluble amyloid precursor protein alpha.
24857774|a|Activation of nonamyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been hypothesized to be a viable approach for Alzheimer's disease drug discovery. However, until recently, the lack of HTS-compatible assay technologies precluded large scale screening efforts to discover molecules that potentiate nonamyloidogenic pathways. We have developed an HTS-compatible assay based on AlphaLISA technology that quantitatively detects soluble APPalpha (sAPPalpha), a marker of nonamyloidogenic processing of APP, released from live cells in low volume, 384-well plates. The assay exhibited good QC parameters (Z'>0.5, S/B>2). A pilot screen of 801 compounds yielded a novel chemotype that increased the release of sAPPalpha 2-fold at 5muM. These results suggest that the AlphaLISA-based HTS assay is robust and sensitive and can be used to screen large compound collections to discover molecules that potentiate the release of sAPPalpha. Additionally, we demonstrated that increase of APP processing by nonamyloidogenic pathways will result in decrease of release of amyloidogenic Abeta40 fragments.

24857861|t|Factors influencing compact-extended structure equilibrium in oligomers of abeta1-40 peptide--an ion mobility mass spectrometry study.
24857861|a|Oligomers formed by amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide are widely believed to be the main neurotoxic agent in Alzheimer's disease. Studies discovered a broad variety of oligomeric forms, which display different levels of toxicity. Some of these forms may further assemble into mature fibrils, while other might be off-pathway from conversion to fibrils and assemble into alternative forms. To better understand a relationship between the structure and toxicity of Abeta oligomers, we require systematic characterization and classification of all possible forms, facilitating rational design of the beneficial modifiers of their activity. In previous ion mobility analysis of Abeta1-40 oligomers, we have detected the coexistence of two alternative structural forms (compact and extended) in a pool of low-order Abeta1-40 oligomers. These forms may represent two pathways of the oligomer evolution, leading either to fibrils or to off-pathway oligomers, which are potential candidates for the neurotoxic species. Here, we have analyzed the impact of incubation time, the presence of selected metal ions and the effect of a series of point mutations on mutual population of alternative forms. We have shown that a salt bridge D23K28 provides stabilization of the compact form whereas G25 is required for the existence of the extended form. We have found that binding of metal ions also stabilizes the compact form. These results improve our understanding of the possible molecular mechanism of the bifurcation of structural evolution of non-monomeric Abeta species into an off-fibril pathway, ultimately leading to the formation of potentially neurotoxic species.

24857980|t|Persistence of behaviours in the Forced Swim Test in 3xTg-AD mice at advanced stages of disease.
24857980|a|Forced Swimming Test (FST) models behavioural despair in animals by loss of motivation to respond or the refusal to escape. The present study characterizes the behavioural responses of 12-month-old male 3xTg-AD mice in FST as compared to age-matched no-transgenic (NTg) mice. Paradoxical results were consistently found from what would be expected from their BPSD (Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia)-like profile. The comprehensive analysis of the ethogram shown in the FST considered the intervals of the test (0-2 and 2-6min), all the elicited behavioural responses (immobility, swimming and climbing) and their features (total duration, frequency of episodes and mean duration). Both genotypes showed equal number of swimming episodes and climbing attempts during the first interval, that resulted in high swimming times, short climbing and scarce immobility. Thereafter, the NTg mice showed a behavioural shift over time and the immobility response showed up. In contrast, all the measures consistently evidenced that 3xTg-AD persisted with the previous behavioural pattern. Genotype differences consisted in less number of episodes of immobility and swimming, and a low immobility time in favour of swimming. No differences were found in 'climbing' attempts. The behavioural response observed is discussed as a lack of ability of 3xTg-AD mice to shift behaviour over time that may result of poorest cognitive flexibility and copying with stress strategies more than behavioural despair per se.

24858299|t|The protease activity of transthyretin reverses the effect of pH on the amyloid-beta protein/heparan sulfate proteoglycan interaction: a biochromatographic study.
24858299|a|Patients suffering of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are characterized by a low transthyretin (TTR) level in the brain. The effect of pH and TTR concentration in the medium on the beta-amyloid protein (Abeta)/heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) association mechanism were studied using a biochromatographic approach. For this purpose, HSPG was immobilized via amino groups onto the amino propyl silica pre-packed column, activated with glutaraldehyde, by using the Schiff base method. Using an equilibrium perturbation method, it was clearly shown that Abeta can be bound with HSPG. This approach allowed the determination of the thermodynamic data of this binding mechanism. The role of the pH was also analyzed. Results from enthalpy-entropy compensation and the plot of the number of protons exchanged versus pH showed that the binding mechanism was dependent on pH with a critical value at pH=6.5. This value agreed with a histidine protonation as an imidazolium cation. Moreover, the corresponding thermodynamical data showed that at pH>6.5, van der Waals and hydrogen bonds due to aromatic amino acids as tyrosine or phenylalanine present in the N-terminal (NT) part governed the Abeta/HSPG association. Abeta remained in its physiological structure in a random coil form (i.e. the non-amyloidogenic structure) because van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonds were preponderant. At acidic pH (pH<6.5), ionic and hydrophobic interactions, created by histidine protonation and hydrophobic amino acids, appeared in the Abeta/HSPG binding. These hydrophobic and ionic interactions led to the conversion of the random coil form of Abeta into a beta-sheet structure which was the amyloidogenic folding. When TTR was incubated with Abeta, the Abeta/HSPG association mechanism was enthalpy driven at all pH values. The affinity of Abeta for HSPG decreased when TTR concentration increased due to the complexation of Abeta with TTR. Also, the decrease of the peak area with the increase of TTR concentration demonstrated that this Abeta/TTR association led to the cleavage of Abeta full length to a smaller fragment. For acidic pH (pH<6.5), it was shown that the importance of the hydrophobic and ionic interactions decreased when TTR concentration increased. This result confirmed that Abeta was cleaved by TTR in a part containing only the NT part. Our results demonstrated clearly that TTR reversed the effect of acidic pH and thus played a protective role in AD.

24858312|t|Potassium 2-(1-hydroxypentyl)-benzoate promotes long-term potentiation in Abeta1-42-injected rats and APP/PS1 transgenic mice.
24858312|a|AIM: Potassium 2-(1-hydroxypentyl)-benzoate (dl-PHPB) is a new drug candidate for ischemic stroke. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of dl-PHPB on memory deficits and long-term potentiation (LTP) impairment in animal models of Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: The expression of NMDA receptor subunits GluN1 and GluN2B in the hippocampus and cortex of APP/PS1 transgenic mice were detected using Western blot analysis. Memory deficits of the mice were evaluated with the passive avoidance test. LTP impairment was studied in the dentate region of Abeta1-42-injected rats and APP/PS1 transgenic mice. RESULTS: APP/PS1 transgenic mice showed significantly lower levels of GluN1 and p-GluN2B in hippocampus, and chronic administration of dl-PHPB (100 mg   kg(-1)   d(-1), po) reversed the downregulation of p-GluN2B, but did not change GluN1 level in the hippocampus. Furthermore, chronic administration of dl-PHPB reversed the memory deficits in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. In the dentate region of normal rats, injection of dl-PHPB (100 mumol/L, icv) did not change the basal synaptic transmission, but significantly enhanced the high-frequency stimulation (HFS)-induced LTP, which was completely prevented by pre-injection of APV (150 mumol/L, icv). Chronic administration of dl-PHPB (100 mg   kg(-1)   d(-1), po) reversed LTP impairment in Abeta1-42-injected normal rats and APP/PS1 transgenic mice. CONCLUSION: Chronic administration of dl-PHPB improves learning and memory and promotes LTP in the animal models of Alzheimer's disease, possibly via increasing p-GluN2B expression in the hippocampus.

24859152|t|Tanshinone IIA reduces the risk of Alzheimer's disease by inhibiting iNOS, MMP-2 and NF-kappaBp65 transcription and translation in the temporal lobes of rat models of Alzheimer's disease.
24859152|a|Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA), one of the major active constituents of the medicinal herb Salvia miltiorrhiza, has been reported to possess neuroprotective effects against the pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the molecular mechanism underlying this effect remains unclear. To examine the effect of Tan IIA on AD, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms, in vivo animal experiments and in vitro molecular biology investigations were employed in the present study. Firstly, a rat model of AD was successfully established by direct injection of the amyloid beta protein (Abeta) and then these rats were administered an interventional treatment of Tan IIA. The learning and memory ability of rats was evaluated in four groups (Control, Sham, AD and Tan IIA) utilizing a Morris water maze test. Quantitative (q)PCR was employed to detect the mRNA expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and nuclear transcription factor kappa (NF-kappaBp65) in temporal lobe tissues and protein expression was determined with western blot analysis. In addition, association analyses between iNOS, MMP-2 and NF-kappaBp65 at a transcriptional and translational level were performed utilizing Spearman's correlation analysis. In the present study, the results revealed that rats in the AD group demonstrated significant disruptions in learning and memory ability, and the symptoms were evidently reduced by Tan IIA. Furthermore, the upregulation of iNOS, MMP-2 and NF-kappaBp65 at a transcriptional and translational level in AD rats was distinctly inhibited by Tan IIA. Therefore, it was concluded that iNOS, MMP-2 and NF-kappaBp65 are involved in AD development, and Tan IIA may reduce AD risk by inhibiting transcription and translation of these genes. Furthermore, the positive correlation of iNOS and MMP-2 with NF-kappaBp65, respectively, provides evidence supporting the hypothesis that Tan IIA reduces AD risk by inhibiting iNOS and MMP-2 at a transcriptional and translational level through the NF-kappaB pathway. In summary, Tan IIA is an effective neuroprotective agent for AD therapy, and iNOS, MMP-2 and NF-kappaBp65 may be the potential molecular targets for manipulating this effect therapeutically.

24859569|t|The phosphorylation of Hsp20 enhances its association with amyloid-beta to increase protection against neuronal cell death.
24859569|a|Up-regulation of Hsp20 protein levels in response to amyloid fibril formation is considered a key protective response against the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Indeed, the physical interaction between Hsp20 and Abeta is known to prevent Abeta oligomerisation and protects neuronal cells from Abeta mediated toxicity, however, details of the molecular mechanism and regulatory cell signalling events behind this process have remained elusive. Using both conventional MTT end-point assays and novel real time measurement of cell impedance, we show that Hsp20 protects human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells from the neurotoxic effects of Abeta. In an attempt to provide a mechanism for the neuroprotection afforded by Hsp20, we used peptide array, co-immunoprecipitation analysis and NMR techniques to map the interaction between Hsp20 and Abeta and report a binding mode where Hsp20 binds adjacent to the oligomerisation domain of Abeta, preventing aggregation. The Hsp20/Abeta interaction is enhanced by Hsp20 phosphorylation, which serves to increase association with low molecular weight Abeta species and decrease the effective concentration of Hsp20 required to disrupt the formation of amyloid oligomers. Finally, using a novel fluorescent assay for the real time evaluation of morphology-specific Abeta aggregation, we show that phospho-dependency of this effect is more pronounced for fibrils than for globular Abeta forms and that 25mers corresponding to the Hsp20 N-terminal can be used as Abeta aggregate inhibitors. Our report is the first to provide a molecular model for the Hsp20/Abeta complex and the first to suggest that modulation of the cAMP/cGMP pathways could be a novel route to enhance Hsp20-mediated attenuation of Abeta fibril neurotoxicity.

24859763|t|Molecular and cytotoxic properties of hIAPP17-29 and rIAPP17-29 fragments: a comparative study with the respective full-length parent polypeptides.
24859763|a|The human islet polypeptide (hIAPP) or amylin is a 37-residue peptide hormone secreted by beta-cells of the islet of Langerhans in the pancreas. Unlike the rat variant of IAPP (rIAPP), human amylin is highly amyloidogenic and is found as amyloid deposits in nearly 95% of patients afflicted with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Human and rat IAPP have nearly identical primary sequence differing at only six positions which are encompassed within the 17-29 aminoacid region. Using Circular Dichroism (CD), Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and ThT-fluorescence (Th-T), we examined the aggregation properties of both full-length hIAPP1-37 and the related peptide fragment hIAPP17-29. For the sake of comparison, similar experiments were carried out on the respective rat variants rIAPP1-37 and rIAPP17-29. These studies were conducted at physiological pH in buffered solution not containing fluorinated co-solvents as well as in the presence of model membranes (LUV). In addition, the cytotoxic activity of the investigated peptides was determined toward different pancreatic beta-cell lines. All the peptide studied in this work resulted cytotoxic despite beta-sheet structure being observed, in vitro, for the hIAPP1-37 only. This suggests that beta-sheet conformational transition that generally precedes the fibril formation, is not a prerequisite for toxicity towards beta-cells. Interestingly, confocal microscopy indicated that the IAPP peptides can enter the cell and might exert their toxic action at an intracellular level.

24859793|t|Heparin induced dimerization of APP is primarily mediated by E1 and regulated by its acidic domain.
24859793|a|The amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its cellular processing are believed to be centrally involved in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition, many physiological functions have been described for APP, including a role in cell-cell- and cell-ECM-adhesion as well as in axonal outgrowth. We show here the molecular determinants of the oligomerization/dimerization of APP, which is central for its cellular (mis)function. Using size exclusion chromatography (SEC), dynamic light scattering and SEC-coupled static light scattering we demonstrate that the dimerization of APP is energetically induced by a heparin mediated dimerization of the E1 domain, which results in a dimeric interaction of E2. We also show that the acidic domain (AcD) interferes with the dimerization of E1 and propose a model where both, cis- and trans-dimerization occur dependent on cellular localization and function.

24860142|t|Convergence of pathology in dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease: a role for the novel interaction of alpha-synuclein and presenilin 1 in disease.
24860142|a|A growing number of PSEN1 mutations have been associated with dementia with Lewy bodies and familial Alzheimer's disease with concomitant alpha-synuclein pathology. The objective of this study was to determine if PSEN1 plays a direct role in the development of alpha-synuclein pathology in these diseases. Using mass spectrometry, immunoelectron microscopy and fluorescence lifetime image microscopy based on Forster resonance energy transfer (FLIM-FRET) we identified alpha-synuclein as a novel interactor of PSEN1 in wild-type mouse brain tissue. The interaction of alpha-synuclein with PSEN1 was detected in post-mortem brain tissue from cognitively normal cases and was significantly increased in tissue from cases with dementia with Lewy bodies and familial Alzheimer's disease associated with known PSEN1 mutations. We confirmed an increased interaction of PSEN1 and alpha-synuclein in cell lines expressing well characterized familial Alzheimer's disease PSEN1 mutations, L166P and delta exon 9, and demonstrated that PSEN1 mutations associate with increased membrane association and accumulation of alpha-synuclein. Our data provides evidence of a molecular interaction of PSEN1 and alpha-synuclein that may explain the clinical and pathophysiological overlap seen in synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and some forms of Alzheimer's disease.

24860840|t|Preoperative cerebrospinal fluid beta-Amyloid/Tau ratio and postoperative delirium.
24860840|a|OBJECTIVE: The neuropathogenesis of postoperative delirium remains unknown. Low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) betaamyloid protein (Abeta) and high CSF Tau levels are associated with Alzheimer's disease. We therefore assessed whether lower preoperative CSF Abeta/Tau ratio was associated with higher incidence and greater severity of postoperative delirium. METHODS: One hundred and fifty three participants (71+-5 years, 53% males) who had total hip/knee replacement under spinal anesthesia were enrolled. CSF was obtained during initiation of spinal anesthesia. The incidence and severity of postoperative delirium were determined by Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) and Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS) on postoperative day 1 and 2. Abeta40, Abeta42, and Tau levels in the CSF were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The relationships among these variables were determined, adjusting for age and gender. RESULTS: Participants in the lowest quartile of preoperative CSF Abeta40/Tau and Abeta42/Tau ratio had higher incidence (32% versus 17%, P=0. 0482) and greater symptom severity of postoperative delirium (Abeta40/Tau ratio: 4 versus 3, P=0. 034; Abeta42/Tau ratio: 4 versus 3, P=0. 062, the median of the highest Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale score) as compared to the combination of the rest of the quartiles. The preoperative CSF Abeta40/Tau or Abeta42/Tau ratio was inversely associated with Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale score (Abeta40/Tau ratio: -0.12+-0.05, P=0.014, adj. -0.12+-0.05, P=0.018; Abeta42/Tau ratio: -0.65+-0.26, P=0.013, adj. -0.62+-0.27, P=0.022). INTERPRETATION: Lower CSF Abeta/Tau ratio could be associated with postoperative delirium, pending confirmation of our preliminary results in further studies. These findings suggest potential roles of Abeta and/or Tau in postoperative delirium neuropathogenesis.

24861310|t|Pyroglutamylated amyloid-beta is associated with hyperphosphorylated tau and severity of Alzheimer's disease.
24861310|a|Pyroglutamylated amyloid-beta (pE(3)-Abeta) has been suggested to play a major role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis as amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers containing pE(3)-Abeta might initiate tau-dependent cytotoxicity. We aimed to further elucidate the associations among pE(3)-Abeta, full-length Abeta and hyperphosphorylated tau (HP-tau) in human brain tissue. We examined 41 post mortem brains of both AD (n = 18) and controls. Sections from frontal and entorhinal cortices were stained with pE(3)-Abeta, HP-tau and full-length Abeta antibodies. The respective loads were assessed using image analysis and western blot analysis was performed in a subset of cases. All loads were significantly higher in AD, but when using Abeta loads as independent variables only frontal pE(3)-Abeta load predicted AD. In frontal and entorhinal cortices pE(3)-Abeta load independently predicted HP-tau load while non-pE(3)-Abeta failed to do so. All loads correlated with the severity of AD neuropathology. However, partial correlation analysis revealed respective correlations in the frontal cortex only for pE(3)-Abeta load only while in the entorhinal cortex respective correlations were seen for both HP-tau and non-pE(3)-Abeta loads. Mini Mental State Examination scores were independently predicted by entorhinal HP-tau load and by frontal pE(3)-Abeta load. Here, we report an association between pE(3)-Abeta and HP-tau in human brain tissue and an influence of frontal pE(3)-Abeta on both the severity of AD neuropathology and clinical dementia. Our findings further support the notion that pE(3)-Abeta may represent an important link between Abeta and HP-tau, and investigations into its role as diagnostic and therapeutic target in AD are warranted.

24862368|t|Effects of corticotrophin-releasing factor receptor 1 antagonists on amyloid-beta and behavior in Tg2576 mice.
24862368|a|RATIONALE: Previous studies indicate that psychosocial stressors could accelerate amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels and accelerate plaque deposition in mouse models of Alzheimer disease (AD). Stressors enhanced the release of corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF), and exogenous CRF administration mimicked the effects of stress on Abeta levels in mouse models of AD. However, whether CRF receptor 1 (CRF1) antagonists could influence the stress-induced acceleration of an AD-like process in mouse models has not been well studied. OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine whether CRF1 antagonists inhibit the effects of isolation stress on tissue Abeta levels, Abeta plaque deposition, and behaviors related to anxiety and memory in Tg2576 mice, and to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying such effects. METHODS: Cohorts of Tg2576 mouse pups were isolated or group-housed at 21 days of age, and then the subgroups of these cohorts received daily intraperitoneal injections of the CRF1 antagonists, antalarmin or R121919 (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg), or vehicle for 1 week. Other cohorts of Tg2576 mouse pups were isolated or group-housed at 21 days of age, and then at 4 months of age, subgroups of these mice were administered antalarmin (20 mg/kg) or vehicle in their drinking water for 6 months. Finally, cultured primary hippocampal neurons from regular Tg2576 pups (P0) were incubated with CRF (0.1, 1, and 10 nM), antalarmin (100 nM) or H-89 (1 muM) for 48 h. Brain tissues or cultured neurons were collected for histological and biochemical analyses, and behavioral measures were collected in the cohorts of mice that were chronically stressed. RESULTS: Administration of antalarmin at 20 mg/kg dose for 1 week significantly reduced Abeta1-42 levels in isolation stressed mice. Administration of antalarmin for 6 months significantly decreased plasma corticosterone levels, tissue Abeta1-42 levels, and Abeta plaque deposition in the brain and blocked the effects of isolation stress on behaviors related to anxiety and memory. Finally, incubation of neurons with 100 nM antalarmin inhibited the ability of 10 nM CRF to increase Abeta1-42 levels and protein kinase A IIbeta expression. The effect of CRF1 on Abeta1-42 levels was also diminished by treatment with H-89, a c-AMP/PKA inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that CRF1 antagonists can slow an AD-like process in Tg2576 mice and that the c-AMP/PKA signaling pathway may be involved in this effect.

24863220|t|Investigation of the inhibitory effects of TiO(2) on the beta-amyloid peptide aggregation.
24863220|a|TiO2 thin films are of great interest as biocompatible coatings and also as photocatalytic self-cleaning and antimicrobial coatings. In this work we used beta-amyloid as a model for infectious protein to investigate the attachment and photocatalytic degradation. TiO2 films were prepared on stainless steel substrates using magnetron sputtering. The films were characterised before and after exposure to beta-amyloid (1-42), using XRD, Raman spectroscopy, XPS and AFM. The TiO2 film was mostly composed of the anatase phase with a relatively high surface roughness. The presence of Raman peaks at 1668cm(-1) and 1263cm(-1), with the XPS spectral feature for nitrogen at 400eV, confirmed the adsorption of amyloid on surface. Following exposure of the beta-amyloid contaminated TiO2 to UV-B irradiation a slight shift of amide modes was observed. Furthermore, the amide I spectra show an overall decrease in alpha-helix content with presence of a minor peak around 1591cm(-1), which is related to tryptophanyl and tyrosinyl radicals, which can lead to conformational change of beta-amyloid. The C1s band at 292.2eV suggests the formation of free carboxylic acid. The loss in the crucial structure of beta-amyloid leads to reduce the fibril formation, thought to be induced through a photocatalytic process.

24863668|t|Iron overload accelerates neuronal amyloid-beta production and cognitive impairment in transgenic mice model of Alzheimer's disease.
24863668|a|Iron dyshomeostasis is proving increasingly likely to be involved in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD); yet, its mechanism is not well understood. Here, we investigated the AD-related mechanism(s) of iron-sulfate exposure in vitro and in vivo, using cultured primary cortical neurons and APP/PS1 AD-model mice, respectively. In both systems, we observed iron-induced disruptions of amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, neuronal signaling, and cognitive behavior. Iron overload increased production of amyloidogenic KPI-APP and amyloid beta. Further, this APP misprocessing was blocked by MK-801 in vitro, suggesting the effect was N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) dependent. Calcium imaging confirmed that 24 hours iron exposure led to disrupted synaptic signaling by augmenting GluN2B-containing NMDAR expression-GluN2B messenger RNA and protein levels were increased and promoting excessing extrasynaptic NMDAR signaling. The disrupted GluN2B expression was concurrent with diminished expression of the splicing factors, sc35 and hnRNPA1. In APP/PS1 mice, chronic iron treatment led to hastened progression of cognitive impairment with the novel object recognition discrimination index, revealing a deficit at the age of 4 months, concomitant with augmented GluN2B expression. Together, these data suggest iron-induced APP misprocessing and hastened cognitive decline occur through inordinate extrasynaptic NMDAR activation.

24863958|t|Multifunctional 8-hydroxyquinoline-appended cyclodextrins as new inhibitors of metal-induced protein aggregation.
24863958|a|Mounting evidence suggests a pivotal role of metal imbalances in protein misfolding and amyloid diseases. As such, metal ions represent a promising therapeutic target. In this context, the synthesis of chelators that also contain complementary functionalities to combat the multifactorial nature of neurodegenerative diseases is a highly topical issue. We report two new 8-hydroxyquinoline-appended cyclodextrins and highlight their multifunctional properties, including their Cu(II) and Zn(II) binding abilities, and capacity to act as antioxidants and metal-induced antiaggregants. In particular, the latter property has been applied in the development of an effective assay that exploits the formation of amyloid fibrils when beta-lactoglobulin A is heated in the presence of metal ions.

24865997|t|Ablation of MMP9 gene ameliorates paracellular permeability and fibrinogen-amyloid beta complex formation during hyperhomocysteinemia.
24865997|a|Increased blood level of homocysteine (Hcy), called hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) accompanies many cognitive disorders including Alzheimer's disease. We hypothesized that HHcy-enhanced cerebrovascular permeability occurs via activation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) and leads to an increased formation of fibrinogen-beta-amyloid (Fg-Abeta) complex. Cerebrovascular permeability changes were assessed in C57BL/6J (wild type, WT), cystathionine-beta-synthase heterozygote (Cbs+/-, a genetic model of HHcy), MMP9 gene knockout (Mmp9-/-), and Cbs and Mmp9 double knockout (Cbs+/-/Mmp9-/-) mice using a dual-tracer probing method. Expression of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) and Fg-Abeta complex formation was assessed in mouse brain cryosections by immunohistochemistry. Short-term memory of mice was assessed with a novel object recognition test. The cerebrovascular permeability in Cbs+/- mice was increased via mainly the paracellular transport pathway. VE-cadherin expression was the lowest and Fg-Abeta complex formation was the highest along with the diminished short-term memory in Cbs+/- mice. These effects of HHcy were ameliorated in Cbs+/-/Mmp9-/- mice. Thus, HHcy causes activation of MMP9 increasing cerebrovascular permeability by downregulation of VE-cadherin resulting in an enhanced formation of Fg-Abeta complex that can be associated with loss of memory. These data may lead to the identification of new targets for therapeutic intervention that can modulate HHcy-induced cerebrovascular permeability and resultant pathologies.

24866012|t|A membrane proximal helix in the cytosolic domain of the human APP interacting protein LR11/SorLA deforms liposomes.
24866012|a|Over the last decade, compelling evidence has linked the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) to defective intracellular trafficking of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Faulty APP trafficking results in an overproduction of Abeta peptides, which is generally agreed to be the primary cause of AD-related pathogenesis. LR11 (SorLA), a type I transmembrane sorting receptor, has emerged as a key regulator of APP trafficking and processing. It directly interacts with APP and diverts it away from amyloidogenic processing. The 54-residue cytosolic domain of LR11 is essential for its proper intracellular localization and trafficking which, in turn, determines the fate of APP. Here, we have found a surprising membrane-proximal amphipathic helix in the cytosolic domain of LR11. Moreover, a peptide corresponding to this region folds into an alpha-helical structure in the presence of liposomes and transforms liposomes to small vesicles and tubule-like particles. We postulate that this amphipathic helix may contribute to the dynamic remodeling of membrane structure and facilitate LR11 intracellular transport.

24866237|t|GGA1 overexpression attenuates amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein in Niemann-Pick type C cells.
24866237|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and a rare inherited disorder of cholesterol transport, Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) share several similarities including aberrant APP processing and increased Abeta production. Previously, we have shown that the AD-like phenotype in NPC model cells involves cholesterol-dependent enhanced APP cleavage by beta-secretase and accumulation of both APP and BACE1 within endocytic compartments. Since retrograde transport of BACE1 from endocytic compartments to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) is regulated by the Golgi-localized gamma-ear containing ADP ribosylation factor-binding protein 1 (GGA1), we analyzed in this work a potential role of GGA1 in the AD-like phenotype of NPC1-null cells. Overexpression of GGA1 caused a shift in APP processing towards the non-amyloidogenic pathway by increasing the localization of APP at the cell surface. However, the observed effect appear to be independent on the subcellular localization and phosphorylation state of BACE1. These findings show that the AD-like phenotype of NPC model cells can be partly reverted by promoting a non-amyloidogenic processing of APP through the upregulation of GGA1 supporting its preventive role against AD.

24866404|t|White matter integrity is associated with cerebrospinal fluid markers of Alzheimer's disease in normal adults.
24866404|a|We explored whether white matter (WM) integrity in cognitively normal (CN) older adults is associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of Alzheimer's disease pathology. Twenty CN older adults underwent lumbar puncture and magnetic resonance imaging within a few days of each other. Analysis of diffusion tensor imaging data involved a priori region of interest and voxelwise approaches. The region of interest results revealed a positive correlation between CSF measures of amyloid-beta (Abeta(42) and Abeta(42)/p-Tau(181)) and WM integrity in the fornix, a relationship which persisted after controlling for hippocampal volume and fornix volume. Lower WM integrity in the same portion of the fornix was also associated with reduced performance on the Digit Symbol test. Subsequent exploratory voxelwise analyses indicated a positive correlation between CSF Abeta(42)/p-Tau(181) and WM integrity in bilateral portions of the fornix, superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and in the corpus callosum and left inferior longitudinal fasciculus. Our results link lower WM microstructural integrity in CN older adults with CSF biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and suggest that this association in the fornix may be independent of volumetric measures.

24866905|t|Modeling the overall survival of patients with advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer using data of routine laboratory tests.
24866905|a|Cancer patients undergo routine clinical monitoring with an array of blood tests that may carry long-term prognostic information. We aimed to develop a new prognostic model predicting survival for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), based on laboratory tests commonly performed in clinical practice. A cohort of 1,161 stage IIIB or IV NSCLC patients was divided into training (n = 773) and testing (n = 388) cohorts. We analyzed the associations of 32 commonly tested laboratory variables with patient survival in the training cohort. We developed a model based on those significant laboratory variables, together with important clinical variables. The model was then evaluated in the testing cohort. Five variables, including albumin, total protein, alkaline phosphatase, blood urea nitrogen and international normalized ratio, were significantly associated with patient survival after stepwise selection. A model incorporating these variables classified patients into low-, medium- and high-risk groups with median survival of 16.9, 7.2 and 2.1 months, respectively (p < 0.0001). Compared with low-risk group, patients in the medium- and high-risk groups had a significantly higher risk of death at 1 year, with hazard ratio (HR) of 1.95 (95% CI 1.62-2.36) and 5.22 (4.30-6.34), respectively. These results were validated in the testing cohort. Overall, we developed a prognostic model relying entirely on readily available variables, with similar predictive power to those which depend on more specialized and expensive molecular assays. Further study is necessary to validate and further refine this model, and compare its performance to models based on more specialized and expensive testing.

24867889|t|sAPP modulates iron efflux from brain microvascular endothelial cells by stabilizing the ferrous iron exporter ferroportin.
24867889|a|A sequence within the E2 domain of soluble amyloid precursor protein (sAPP) stimulates iron efflux. This activity has been attributed to a ferroxidase activity suggested for this motif. We demonstrate that the stimulation of efflux supported by this peptide and by sAPPalpha is due to their stabilization of the ferrous iron exporter, ferroportin (Fpn), in the plasma membrane of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMVEC). The peptide does not bind ferric iron explaining why it does not and thermodynamically cannot promote ferrous iron autoxidation. This peptide specifically pulls Fpn down from the plasma membrane of hBMVEC; based on these results, FTP, for ferroportin-targeting peptide, correctly identifies the function of this peptide. The data suggest that in stabilizing Fpn via the targeting due to the FTP sequence, sAPP will increase the flux of iron into the cerebral interstitium. This inference correlates with the observation of significant iron deposition in the amyloid plaques characteristic of Alzheimer's disease.

24868884|t|ETAS, an enzyme-treated asparagus extract, attenuates amyloid beta-induced cellular disorder in PC12 cells.
24868884|a|One of the pathological characterizations of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the deposition of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) in cerebral cortical cells. The deposition of Abeta in neuronal cells leads to an increase in the production of free radicals that are typified by reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby inducing cell death. A growing body of evidence now suggests that several plant-derived food ingredients are capable of scavenging ROS in mammalian cells. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether enzyme-treated asparagus extract (ETAS), which is rich in antioxidants, is one of these ingredients. The pre-incubation of differentiated PC 12 cells with ETAS significantly recovered Abeta-induced reduction of cell viability, which was accompanied by reduced levels of ROS. These results suggest that ETAS may be one of the functional food ingredients with anti-oxidative capacity to help prevent AD.

24869594|t|Juzen-Taiho-to, an herbal medicine, promotes the differentiation of transplanted bone marrow cells into microglia in the mouse brain injected with fibrillar amyloid beta.
24869594|a|Microglia are the main immunocompetent and phagocytic cells in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Bone marrow-derived microglia have been demonstrated to be more effective in antigen presentation and phagocytosis than inherent microglia in AD. Thus, microglia have received much attention in the pathogenesis of AD. The herbal medicine Juzen-taiho-to (JTT) has been reported to reduce beta-amyloid (Abeta) burden in the mouse brain of an AD model. In this study, we explored the effects of JTT on the migration and differentiation of bone marrow-derived cells in the mouse brain of acutely induced AD. To chase bone marrow-derived cells, we made a chimeric mouse line in C57BL/6 by transplanting fresh bone marrow cells, isolated from the transgenic mice expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein gene. The chimeric mice were orally administrated with JTT or distilled water, and were left untreated or given intrahippocampal injection of fibrillar Abeta 1-42 (fAbeta42) or vehicle. In the hippocampus of the vehicle-injected mouse, JTT treatment for 37 days caused a significant increase in the number of microglial cells. In the fAbeta42-injected mouse hippocampus, a larger number of bone marrow-derived cells were detected in JTT-treated mice than control mice in the non-neighboring regions of the fAbeta42-injected site but not around the injected site. These results suggest that JTT might contribute to the reduction of Abeta burden and the immune surveillance in non-pathological as well as pathological brain regions. The results also implicate the therapeutic potential of JTT in AD.

24870034|t|Genome-wide analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae identifies cellular processes affecting intracellular aggregation of Alzheimer's amyloid-beta42: importance of lipid homeostasis.
24870034|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta)-containing plaques are a major neuropathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The two major isoforms of Abeta peptide associated with AD are Abeta40 and Abeta42, of which the latter is highly prone to aggregation. Increased presence and aggregation of intracellular Abeta42 peptides is an early event in AD progression. Improved understanding of cellular processes affecting Abeta42 aggregation may have implications for development of therapeutic strategies. Abeta42 fused to green fluorescent protein (Abeta42-GFP) was expressed in ~4600 mutants of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome-wide deletion library to identify proteins and cellular processes affecting intracellular Abeta42 aggregation by assessing the fluorescence of Abeta42-GFP. This screening identified 110 mutants exhibiting intense Abeta42-GFP-associated fluorescence. Four major cellular processes were overrepresented in the data set, including phospholipid homeostasis. Disruption of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and/or phosphatidylethanolamine metabolism had a major effect on intracellular Abeta42 aggregation and localization. Confocal microscopy indicated that Abeta42-GFP localization in the phospholipid mutants was juxtaposed to the nucleus, most likely associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/ER membrane. These data provide a genome-wide indication of cellular processes that affect intracellular Abeta42-GFP aggregation and may have important implications for understanding cellular mechanisms affecting intracellular Abeta42 aggregation and AD disease progression.

24870607|t|Amyloid beta in hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis-Dutch type.
24870607|a|Hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis - Dutch type is an autosomal dominant hereditary disease caused by a point mutation in the amyloid precursor protein gene on chromosome 21. The mutation causes an amino acid substitution at codon 693 (E22Q), the 'Dutch mutation'. Amyloid beta, the product after cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein, is secreted into the extracellular space. The Dutch mutation leads to altered amyloid beta cleavage and secretion, enhanced aggregation properties, higher proteolysis resistance, lowered brain efflux transporter affinity, and enhanced cell surfaces binding. All these result in amyloid beta accumulation in cerebral vessel walls, causing cell death and vessel wall integrity loss, making cerebral vessel walls in hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis-Dutch type more prone to rupture and obstruction, leading to hemorrhages and infarcts. Studying the effects of altered amyloid beta metabolism due to mutations like the 'Dutch' provides us with a better understanding of amyloid beta toxicity, also in other amyloid beta diseases like sporadic cerebral amyloid angiopathy and Alzheimer's disease.

24871565|t|Metal ions and intrinsically disordered proteins and peptides: from Cu/Zn amyloid-beta to general principles.
24871565|a|The interaction of d-block metal ions (Cu, Zn, Fe, etc.) with intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) has gained interest, partly due to their proposed roles in several diseases, mainly neurodegenerative. A prominent member of IDPs is the peptide amyloid-beta (Abeta) that aggregates into metal-enriched amyloid plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, in which Cu and Zn are bound to Abeta. IDPs are a class of proteins and peptides that lack a unique 3D structure when the protein is isolated. This disordered structure impacts their interaction with metal ions compared with structured metalloproteins. Metalloproteins either have a preorganized metal binding site or fold upon metal binding, resulting in defined 3D structure with a well-defined metal site. In contrast, for Abeta and likely most of the other IDPs, the affinity for Cu(I/II) and Zn(II) is weaker and the interaction is flexible with different coordination sites present. Coordination of Cu(I/II) with Abeta is very dynamic including fast Cu-exchange reactions (milliseconds or less) that are intrapeptidic between different sites as well as interpeptidic. This highly dynamic metal-IDP interaction has a strong impact on reactivity and potential biological role: (i) Due to the low affinity compared with classical metalloproteins, IDPs likely bind metals only at special places or under special conditions. For Abeta, this is likely in the neurons that expel Zn or Cu into the synapse and upon metal dysregulation occurring in Alzheimer's disease. (ii) Amino acid substitutions (mutations) on noncoordinating residues can change drastically the coordination sphere. (iii) Considering the Cu/Zn-Abeta aberrant interaction, therapeutic strategies can be based on removal of Cu/Zn or precluding their binding to the peptide. The latter is very difficult due to the multitude of metal-binding sites, but the fast koff facilitates removal. (iv) The high flexibility of the Cu-Abeta complex results in different conformations with different redox activity. Only some conformations are able to produce reactive oxygen species. (v) Other, more specific catalysis (like enzymes) is very unlikely for Cu/Zn-Abeta. (vi) The Cu/Zn exchange reactions with Abeta are faster than the aggregation process and can hence have a strong impact on this process. In conclusion, the coordination chemistry is fundamentally different for most of IDPs compared with the classical, structured metalloproteins or with (bio)-inorganic complexes. The dynamics is a key parameter to understand this interaction and its potential biological impact.

24874077|t|Leptin attenuates BACE1 expression and amyloid-beta genesis via the activation of SIRT1 signaling pathway.
24874077|a|The aspartyl protease beta-site AbetaPP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in Abeta production, a peptide at the nexus of neurodegenerative cascades in Alzheimer Disease (AD). The adipocytokine leptin has been demonstrated to reduce Abeta production and decrease BACE1 activity and expression levels. However, the signaling cascades involved in the leptin-induced mitigation in Abeta levels and BACE1 expression levels have not been elucidated. We have demonstrated that the transcription factor nuclear factor - kappa B (NF-kappaB) positively regulates BACE1 transcription. NF-kappaB activity is tightly regulated by the mammalian sirtuin SIRT1. Multiple studies have cogently evinced that leptin activates the metabolic master regulator SIRT1. In this study, we determined the extent to which SIRT1 expression and activity regulate the leptin-induced attenuation in BACE1 expression and Abeta levels in cultured human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. This study also elucidated and delineated the signal transduction pathways involved in the leptin induced mitigation in BACE1 expression. Our results demonstrate for the first time that leptin attenuates the activation and transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB by reducing the acetylation of the p65 subunit in a SIRT1-dependent manner. Furthermore, our data shows that leptin reduces the NF-kappaB-mediated transcription of BACE1 and consequently reduces Amyloid-beta genesis. Our study provides a valuable insight and a novel mechanism by which leptin reduces BACE1 expression and Amyloid-beta production and may help design potential therapeutic interventions.

24874292|t|High-efficiency organic light-emitting diodes with fluorescent emitters.
24874292|a|Fluorescence-based organic light-emitting diodes have continued to attract interest because of their long operational lifetimes, high colour purity of electroluminescence and potential to be manufactured at low cost in next-generation full-colour display and lighting applications. In fluorescent molecules, however, the exciton production efficiency is limited to 25% due to the deactivation of triplet excitons. Here we report fluorescence-based organic light-emitting diodes that realize external quantum efficiencies as high as 13.4-18% for blue, green, yellow and red emission, indicating that the exciton production efficiency reached nearly 100%. The high performance is enabled by utilization of thermally activated delayed fluorescence molecules as assistant dopants that permit efficient transfer of all electrically generated singlet and triplet excitons from the assistant dopants to the fluorescent emitters. Organic light-emitting diodes employing this exciton harvesting process provide freedom for the selection of emitters from a wide variety of conventional fluorescent molecules. 

24874542|t|Interleukin-1beta mediated amyloid plaque clearance is independent of CCR2 signaling in the APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
24874542|a|Neuroinflammation is a key component of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Particularly, the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) is upregulated in human AD and believed to promote amyloid plaque deposition. However, studies from our laboratory have shown that chronic IL-1beta overexpression in the APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) mouse model of AD ameliorates amyloid pathology, increases plaque-associated microglia, and induces recruitment of peripheral immune cells to the brain parenchyma. To investigate the contribution of CCR2 signaling in IL-1beta-mediated amyloid plaque clearance, seven month-old APP/PS1/CCR2(-/-) mice were intrahippocampally transduced with a recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 2 containing the cleaved form of human IL-1beta (rAAV2-IL-1beta). Four weeks after rAAV2-IL-1beta transduction, we found significant reductions in 6E10 and Congo red staining of amyloid plaques that was confirmed by decreased levels of insoluble Abeta1-42 and Abeta1-40 in the inflamed hippocampus. Bone marrow chimeric studies confirmed the presence of infiltrating immune cells following IL-1beta overexpression and revealed that dramatic reduction of CCR2(+) peripheral mononuclear cell recruitment to the inflamed hippocampus did not prevent the ability of IL-1beta to induce amyloid plaque clearance. These results suggest that infiltrating CCR2(+) monocytes do not contribute to IL-1beta-mediated amyloid plaque clearance.

24876064|t|N-truncation and pyroglutaminylation enhances the opsonizing capacity of Abeta-peptides and facilitates phagocytosis by macrophages and microglia.
24876064|a|Abnormal accumulations of amyloid-beta (Abeta)-peptides are one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The precursor of the Abeta-peptides, the amyloid precursor protein (APP), is also found in peripheral blood cells, but its function in these cells remains elusive. We previously observed that mononuclear phagocytes release Abeta-peptides during activation and phagocytosis, suggesting a physiologic role in inflammatory processes. Here, we show that supplementing the media with soluble N-terminally truncated Abeta(2-40) and Abeta(2-42) as well as Abeta(1-42) induced the phagocytosis of polystyrene particles (PSPs) by primary human monocytes. If the PSPs were pre-incubated with Abeta-peptides, phagocytosis was induced by all tested Abeta-peptide species. N-terminally truncated Abeta(x-42) induced the phagocytosis of PSPs significantly more effectively than did Abeta(x-40). Similarly, the phagocytosis of Escherichia coli by GM-CSF- and M-CSF-elicited macrophages as well as microglia was particularly facilitated by pre-incubation with N-terminally truncated Abeta(x-42). The proinflammatory polarization of monocytes was indicated by the reduced MSRI expression and IL-10 secretion after phagocytosis of PSPs coated with Abeta(1-42), Abeta(2-42) and Abeta(3p-42). Polarization of the macrophages by GM-CSF reduced the phagocytic activity, but it did not affect the capabilities of Abeta-peptides to opsonize prey. Taken together, Abeta-peptides support phagocytosis as soluble factors and act as opsonins. Differential effects among the Abeta-peptide variants point to distinct mechanisms of interaction among monocytes/macrophages, prey and Abeta-peptides. A proinflammatory polarization induced by the phagocytosis of Abeta-peptide coated particles may provide a model for the chronic inflammatory reaction and sustained plaque deposition in AD.

24876496|t|Composition of isolated synaptic boutons reveals the amounts of vesicle trafficking proteins.
24876496|a|Synaptic vesicle recycling has long served as a model for the general mechanisms of cellular trafficking. We used an integrative approach, combining quantitative immunoblotting and mass spectrometry to determine protein numbers; electron microscopy to measure organelle numbers, sizes, and positions; and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy to localize the proteins. Using these data, we generated a three-dimensional model of an "average" synapse, displaying 300,000 proteins in atomic detail. The copy numbers of proteins involved in the same step of synaptic vesicle recycling correlated closely. In contrast, copy numbers varied over more than three orders of magnitude between steps, from about 150 copies for the endosomal fusion proteins to more than 20,000 for the exocytotic ones. 

24878198|t|Naturally occurring polyphenolic inhibitors of amyloid beta aggregation.
24878198|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disease and is one of the main causes of death in developed countries. Consumption of foods rich in polyphenolics is strongly correlated with reduced incidence of Alzheimer's disease. Our study has investigated the biological activity of previously untested polyphenolic compounds in preventing amyloid beta aggregation. The anti-aggregatory potential of these compounds was assessed using the Thioflavin-T assay, transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering and size exclusion chromatography. Two structurally related compounds, luteolin and transilitin were identified as potent inhibitors of Abeta fibril formation. Computational docking studies with an X-ray derived oligomeric structure offer a rationale for the inhibitory activity observed and may facilitate development of improved inhibitors of Abeta aggregation and toxicity.

24878959|t|Nuclear translocation uncovers the amyloid peptide Abeta42 as a regulator of gene transcription.
24878959|a|Although soluble species of the amyloid-beta peptide Abeta42 correlate with disease symptoms in Alzheimer disease, little is known about the biological activities of amyloid-beta (Abeta). Here, we show that Abeta peptides varying in lengths from 38 to 43 amino acids are internalized by cultured neuroblastoma cells and can be found in the nucleus. By three independent methods, we demonstrate direct detection of nuclear Abeta42 as follows: (i) biochemical analysis of nuclear fractions; (ii) detection of biotin-labeled Abeta in living cells by confocal laser scanning microscopy; and (iii) transmission electron microscopy of Abeta in cultured cells, as well as brain tissue of wild-type and transgenic APPPS1 mice (overexpression of amyloid precursor protein and presenilin 1 with Swedish and L166P mutations, respectively). Also, this study details a novel role for Abeta42 in nuclear signaling, distinct from the amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that Abeta42 specifically interacts as a repressor of gene transcription with LRP1 and KAI1 promoters. By quantitative RT-PCR, we confirmed that mRNA levels of the examined candidate genes were exclusively decreased by the potentially neurotoxic Abeta42 wild-type peptide. Shorter peptides (Abeta38 or Abeta40) and other longer peptides (nontoxic Abeta42 G33A substitution or Abeta43) did not affect mRNA levels. Overall, our data indicate that the nuclear translocation of Abeta42 impacts gene regulation, and deleterious effects of Abeta42 in Alzheimer disease pathogenesis may be influenced by altering the expression profiles of disease-modifying genes.

24879532|a|The synthesis of 1,3,6-trisubstituted-2,5-diketopiperazine scaffolds bearing up to three 'clickable' sites for further oxime bond or alkyne-azide cycloaddition ligations is described. The orthogonally Boc/Alloc protected DKP precursors prepared from L-lysine residues and an aminohexyl arm are efficiently prepared on a gram scale by sequentially using Fukuyama-Mitsunobu alkylation, dipeptide coupling and diketopiperazine ring formation as key steps. These scaffolds, with their glyoxylyl, aminooxy, alkynyl or azido functions, are "ready-to-use" platforms for biomolecular assembly. Their potentiality in this field was proved through the chemoselective ligation of Abeta-binding motifs, the KLVFFA peptide and the curcumin molecule. The inhibitory effect of these conjugates on Abeta amyloid fibril formation is reported using thioflavin T fluorescence assays and AFM observation.

24879954|t|Montelukast rescues primary neurons against Abeta1-42-induced toxicity through inhibiting CysLT1R-mediated NF-kappaB signaling.
24879954|a|Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), which can invoke a cascade of inflammatory responses, is considered to play a causal role in the development and progress of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Montelukast, known as a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLT1R) antagonist, is currently used for treatment of inflammatory diseases such as asthma. We have previously reported that CysLT1R activation is involved in Abeta generation. In this study, we investigated rescuing effect of CysLT1R antagonist montelukast on Abeta1-42-induced neurotoxicity in primary neurons. Our data showed that Abeta1-42 elicited a marked increase of CysLT1R expression in primary mouse neurons. This increment of CysLT1R expression was accompanied by increases of inflammatory factors such as NF-kappaB p65, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) as well as pro-apoptotic protein Caspase-3 activation and anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2 reduction. Abeta1-42-mediated increase of CysLT1R expression was associated with Abeta1-42-induced cytotoxicity as measured by MTT reduction assay and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay. This observation was confirmed with treatment of montelukast, a selective CysLT1R antagonist, which had significant effect on Abeta1-42-induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, blockade of CysLT1R with montelukast reversed Abeta1-42-mediated increase of CysLT1R expression, and concomitant changes of the pro-inflammatory factors and the apoptosis-related proteins. The results demonstrate that montelukast rescued neurons against Abeta1-42-induced neurotoxicity, neuroinflammation and apoptosis by down-regulating CysLT1R-mediated NF-kappaB signaling, suggesting that CysLT1R may be a potential target for AD, and its antagonist may have beneficial effects for treatment of AD.

24884841|t|Higher incidence of premenopausal breast cancer in less developed countries; myth or truth?
24884841|a|BACKGROUND: Fundamental etiologic differences have been suggested to cause earlier onset of breast cancer in less developed countries (LDCs) than in more developed countries (MDCs). We explored this hypothesis using world-wide breast cancer incidence data. METHODS: We compared international age-standardized incidence rates (ASR) of pre- (<50 years) and postmenopausal (>=50 years) breast cancers as well as temporal trends in ASRs of pre-and postmenopausal breast cancer among selected countries during 1975-2008. We used joinpoint log-linear regression analysis to estimate annual percent changes (APC) for premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer in the northern Europe and in Black and White women population in the US. RESULTS: Premenopausal breast cancers comprised a substantially higher proportion of all incident breast cancers in LDCs (average 47.3%) compared to MDCs (average 18.5%). However, the ASR of premenopausal breast cancer was consistently higher in MDCs (29.4/100,000) than LDCs (12.8/100,000). The ASR of postmenopausal cancer was about five-fold higher in the MDCs (307.6/100,000) than the LDCs (65.4/100,000). The APC of breast cancer in Denmark was substantially higher in postmenopausal (1.33%) than premenopausal cancer (0.98%). Higher incidence of breast cancer among the white than black women in the US was pertained only to the postmenopausal cancer. CONCLUSION: The substantial and consistent lower age-specific incidence of breast cancer in LDCs than in MDCs contradicts the theory of earlier onset. Demographic differences with fewer old women in LDCs and lower prevalence of risk factors of postmenopausal cancer are the most likely explanation to the lower mean age at diagnosis in these countries.

24886882|t|Jujuboside A, a neuroprotective agent from semen Ziziphi Spinosae ameliorates behavioral disorders of the dementia mouse model induced by Abeta 1-42.
24886882|a|Semen Ziziphi Spinosae (SZS) has been used as a hypnotic-sedative medicine for thousands of years. Recently, SZS has also shown notable neuroprotective activities via anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects in dementia animals. Jujuboside A (JuA), isolated from SZS, has been proved to be a major hypnotic-sedative component of SZS. In the present study, we firstly evaluated the effects of intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of JuA (0.02 and 0.2mg/kg) for five consecutive days on cognitive impairment induced by ICV injection of Abeta 1-42. The results showed that ICV treatment with JuA significantly mitigated learning and memory impairment in mice induced by Abeta 1-42 as measured by the Y-maze, active avoidance and Morris water maze. Furthermore, ICV treatment with JuA reduced the level of Abeta 1-42 in hippocampus, significantly inhibited the activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and NO, and decreased the amount of the increased malondialdehyde (MDA) in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of mice treated with ICV injection of Abeta 1-42. Shrinkage of nuclei, swollen and eccentrically dispersed neuronal bodies were observed in hippocampus of AD mice induced by Abeta 1-42, however, JuA noticeably improved the histopathological damage. Cumulatively, the present study indicates that JuA may serve as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of Alzheimer' disease.

24886908|t|The preclinical Alzheimer cognitive composite: measuring amyloid-related decline.
24886908|a|IMPORTANCE: As Alzheimer disease (AD) research moves to intervene in presymptomatic phases of the disease, we must develop outcome measures sensitive to the earliest disease-related changes. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the feasibility of a cognitive composite outcome for clinically normal elderly participants with evidence of AD pathology using the ADCS Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (ADCS-PACC). The ADCS-PACC combines tests that assess episodic memory, timed executive function, and global cognition. The ADCS-PACC is the primary outcome measure for the first clinical trial in preclinical AD (ie, the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's study). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: With the ADCS-PACC, we derive pilot estimates of amyloid-related decline using data from 2 observational studies conducted in North America and another conducted in Australia. The participants analyzed had normal cognition and mean ages of 75.81, 71.37, and 79.42 years across the 3 studies. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: For the 2 studies that collected data on Abeta levels (ADNI and AIBL), we estimate decline in a preclinical AD "Abeta-positive" placebo group and compare them with an "Abeta-negative" group. For the study that did not include data on Abeta levels (the ADCS Prevention Instrument [ADCS-PI] study), we grouped participants by the presence of APOE-epsilon4 and by clinical progression. RESULTS: In ADNI, Abeta-positive participants showed more decline than did Abeta-negative participants with regard to the ADCS-PACC score at 24 months (mean [SE] difference, -1.239 [0.522] [95% CI, -2.263 to -0.215]; P = .02). In AIBL, the mean (SE) difference is significant at both 18 months (-1.009 [0.406] [95% CI, -1.805 to -0.213]; P = .01) and 36 months (-1.404 [0.452] [95% CI, -2.290 to -0.519]; P = .002). In the ADCS-PI study, APOE-epsilon4 allele carriers performed significantly worse on the ADCS-PACC at 24 months (mean [SE] score, -0.742 [0.294] [95% CI, -1.318 to -0.165]; P = .01) and 36 months (-1.531 [0.469] [95% CI, -2.450 to -0.612]; P = .001). In the ADCS-PI study, cognitively normal participants who progress from a global Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0 are significantly worse on the ADCS-PACC than cognitively normal participants who are stable with a global Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0 at months 12, 24, and 36 (mean [SE] ADCS-PACC score, -4.471 [0.702] [95% CI, -5.848 to -3.094]; P < .001). Using pilot estimates of variance and assuming 500 participants per group with 30% attrition and a 5% alpha level, we project 80% power to detect effects in the range of Delta = 0.467 to 0.733 on the ADCS-PACC. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Analyses of at-risk cognitively normal populations suggest that we can reliably measure the first signs of cognitive decline with the ADCS-PACC. These analyses also suggest the feasibility of secondary prevention trials.

24887018|t|Effect of 1 night of total sleep deprivation on cerebrospinal fluid beta-amyloid 42 in healthy middle-aged men: a randomized clinical trial.
24887018|a|IMPORTANCE: Increasing evidence suggests a relationship between poor sleep and the risk of developing Alzheimer disease. A previous study found an effect of sleep on beta-amyloid (Abeta), which is a key protein in Alzheimer disease pathology. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of 1 night of total sleep deprivation on cerebrospinal fluid Abeta42 protein levels in healthy middle-aged men. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Alzheimer, Wakefulness, and Amyloid Kinetics (AWAKE) study at the Radboud Alzheimer Center, a randomized clinical trial that took place between June 1, 2012, and October 1, 2012. Participants were cognitively normal middle-aged men (40-60 years of age) with normal sleep (n = 26) recruited from the local population. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to 1 night with unrestricted sleep (n = 13) or 1 night of total sleep deprivation (24 hours of wakefulness) (n = 13). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Sleep was monitored using continuous polysomnographic recording from 3 pm until 10 am. Cerebrospinal fluid samples were collected using an intrathecal catheter at defined times to compare cerebral Abeta42 concentrations between evening and morning. RESULTS: A night of unrestricted sleep led to a 6% decrease in Abeta42 levels of 25.3 pg/mL (95% CI [0.94, 49.6], P = .04), whereas sleep deprivation counteracted this decrease. When accounting for the individual trajectories of Abeta42 over time, a difference of 75.8 pg/mL of Abeta42 was shown between the unrestricted sleep and sleep deprivation group (95% CI [3.4, 148.4], P = .04). The individual trajectories of evening and morning Abeta42 concentrations differed between the unrestricted sleep and sleep deprivation groups (P = .04) in contrast to stable Abeta40, tau, and total protein levels. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Sleep deprivation, or prolonged wakefulness, interferes with a physiological morning decrease in Abeta42. We hypothesize that chronic sleep deprivation increases cerebral Abeta42 levels, which elevates the risk of Alzheimer disease. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01194713.

24887203|t|Early alterations in energy metabolism in the hippocampus of APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
24887203|a|The present study had focused on the behavioral phenotype and gene expression profile of molecules related to insulin receptor signaling in the hippocampus of 3 and 6 month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Elevated levels of the insoluble Abeta (1-42) were detected in the brain extracts of the transgenic animals as early as 3 months of age, prior to the Abeta plaque formation (pre-plaque stage). By the early plaque stage (6 months) both the soluble and insoluble Abeta (1-40) and Abeta (1-42) peptides were detectable. We studied the expression of genes related to memory function (Arc, Fos), insulin signaling, including insulin receptor (Insr), Irs1 and Irs2, as well as genes involved in insulin growth factor pathways, such as Igf1, Igf2, Igfr and Igfbp2. We also examined the expression and protein levels of key molecules related to energy metabolism (PGC1-alpha, and AMPK) and mitochondrial functionality (OXPHOS, TFAM, NRF1 and NRF2). 6 month-old APP/PS1 mice demonstrated impaired cognitive ability, were glucose intolerant and showed a significant reduction in hippocampal Insr and Irs2 transcripts. Further observations also suggest alterations in key cellular energy sensors that regulate the activities of a number of metabolic enzymes through phosphorylation, such as a decrease in the Prkaa2 mRNA levels and in the pAMPK (Thr172)/Total APMK ratio. Moreover, mRNA and protein analysis reveals a significant downregulation of genes essential for mitochondrial replication and respiratory function, including PGC-1alpha in hippocampal extracts of APP/PS1 mice, compared to age-matched wild-type controls at 3 and 6 months of age. Overall, the findings of this study show early alterations in genes involved in insulin and energy metabolism pathways in an APP/PS1 model of AD. These changes affect the activity of key molecules like NRF1 and PGC-1alpha, which are involved in mitochondrial biogenesis. Our results reinforce the hypothesis that the impairments in both insulin signaling and energy metabolism precede the development of AD amyloidogenesis.

24890399|t|Beneficial properties of natural phenols: highlight on protection against pathological conditions associated with amyloid aggregation.
24890399|a|Mediterranean and Asian diets are currently considered as the most healthy traditional feeding habits effective against risk of age-associated, particularly cardiovascular and neurodegenerative, diseases. A common feature of these two regimens is the abundance of foods and beverages of plant origin (green tea, extra virgin olive oil, red wine, spices, berries, and aromatic herbs) that are considered responsible for the observed beneficial effects. Epidemiological data suggest that the phenolic component remarkably enriched in these foods plays an important role in reducing the incidence of amyloid diseases, pathological conditions associated to tissue deposition of toxic protein aggregates responsible for progressive functional deterioration. Great effort is being spent to provide knowledge on the effects of several natural phenols in this context, moving from the test tube to animal models and, more slowly, to the patient's bed. An emerging feature that makes these molecules increasingly attractive for amyloid disease prevention and therapy is their wide spectrum of activity: recent pieces of evidence suggest that they can inhibit the production of amyloidogenic peptides from precursors, increase antioxidant enzyme activity, activate autophagy and reduce inflammation. Our concept should than shift from considering natural phenols simply as antioxidants or, at the best, as amyloid aggregation inhibitors, to describing them as potentially multitargeting drugs. A main concern is the low bioavailability of such compounds and efforts aimed at improving it are underway, with encapsulation strategies being the most promising ones.

24893984|t|Potassium 2-(1-hydroxypentyl)-benzoate improves memory deficits and attenuates amyloid and tau pathologies in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
24893984|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition and neurofibrillary tangles. Dl-PHPB [potassium 2-(1-hydroxypentyl)-benzoate], has been shown to have neuroprotective effects on cerebral ischemic, vascular dementia, and Abeta-induced animal models by inhibiting oxidative injury, neuronal apoptosis, and glial activation. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of dl-PHPB on learning and memory in amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS1) double-transgenic AD mouse models (APP/PS1) and the mechanisms of dl-PHPB in reducing Abeta accumulation and tau phosphorylation. Twelve-month-old APP/PS1 mice were given 30 mg/kg dl-PHPB by oral gavage for 3 months. Dl-PHPB treatment significantly improved the spatial learning and memory deficits compared with the vehicle-treated APP/PS1 mice. In the meantime, dl-PHPB obviously reduced tau hyperphosphorylation at Ser199, Thr205, and Ser396 sites in APP/PS1 mice. This reduction was accompanied by APP phosphorylation reduction and protein kinase C activation. In addition, expression of cyclin-dependent kinase and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta, the most important kinases involved in tau phosphorylation, was markedly decreased by dl-PHPB treatment. Phosphorylated protein kinase B and phosphoinositide 3-kinase levels of APP/PS1 mice were significantly reduced compared with levels in wild-type mice, and dl-PHPB reversed the reduction. The effects of dl-PHPB effecting a decrease in tau phosphorylation and kinase activation were further confirmed in neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells overexpressing wild-type human APP695. These data raised the possibility that dl-PHPB might be a promising multitarget neuronal protective agent for the treatment of AD.

24894631|t|The FAM3 superfamily member ILEI ameliorates Alzheimer's disease-like pathology by destabilizing the penultimate amyloid-beta precursor.
24894631|a|Accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) in the brain underlies the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta is produced by beta- and gamma-secretase-mediated sequential proteolysis of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP). Here we identify a secretory protein named interleukin-like epithelial-mesenchymal transition inducer (ILEI, also known as FAM3 superfamily member C) as a negative regulator of Abeta production. ILEI destabilizes the beta-secretase-cleaved APP carboxy-terminal fragment, the penultimate precursor of Abeta, by binding to the gamma-secretase complex and interfering with its chaperone properties. Notch signalling and gamma-secretase activity are not affected by ILEI. We also show neuronal expression of ILEI and its induction by transforming growth factor-beta signalling. The level of secreted ILEI is markedly decreased in the brains of AD patients. Transgenic (Tg) overexpression of ILEI significantly reduces the brain Abeta burden and ameliorates the memory deficit in AD model mice. ILEI may be a plausible target for the development of disease-modifying therapies.

24895350|t|Monitoring the ability to deliver care in low- and middle-income countries: a systematic review of health facility assessment tools.
24895350|a|INTRODUCTION: Health facilities assessments are an essential instrument for health system strengthening in low- and middle-income countries. These assessments are used to conduct health facility censuses to assess the capacity of the health system to deliver health care and to identify gaps in the coverage of health services. Despite the valuable role of these assessments, there are currently no minimum standards or frameworks for these tools. METHODS: We used a structured keyword search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE and HealthStar databases and searched the websites of the World Health Organization, the World Bank and the International Health Facilities Assessment Network to locate all available health facilities assessment tools intended for use in low- and middle-income countries. We parsed the various assessment tools to identify similarities between them, which we catalogued into a framework comprising 41 assessment domains. RESULTS: We identified 10 health facility assessment tools meeting our inclusion criteria, all of which were included in our analysis. We found substantial variation in the comprehensiveness of the included tools, with the assessments containing indicators in 13 to 33 (median: 25.5) of the 41 assessment domains included in our framework. None of the tools collected data on all 41 of the assessment domains we identified. CONCLUSIONS: Not only do a large number of health facility assessment tools exist, but the data they collect and methods they employ are very different. This certainly limits the comparability of the data between different countries' health systems and probably creates blind spots that impede efforts to strengthen those systems. Agreement is needed on the essential elements of health facility assessments to guide the development of specific indicators and for refining existing instruments.

24895380|t|Global analysis of S-nitrosylation sites in the wild type (APP) transgenic mouse brain-clues for synaptic pathology.
24895380|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by an early synaptic loss, which strongly correlates with the severity of dementia. The pathogenesis and causes of characteristic AD symptoms are not fully understood. Defects in various cellular cascades were suggested, including the imbalance in production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Alterations in S-nitrosylation of several proteins were previously demonstrated in various AD animal models and patients. In this work, using combined biotin-switch affinity/nano-LC-MS/MS and bioinformatic approaches we profiled endogenous S-nitrosylation of brain synaptosomal proteins from wild type and transgenic mice overexpressing mutated human Amyloid Precursor Protein (hAPP). Our data suggest involvement of S-nitrosylation in the regulation of 138 synaptic proteins, including MAGUK, CamkII, or synaptotagmins. Thirty-eight proteins were differentially S-nitrosylated in hAPP mice only. Ninety-five S-nitrosylated peptides were identified for the first time (40% of total, including 33 peptides exclusively in hAPP synaptosomes). We verified differential S-nitrosylation of 10 (26% of all identified) synaptosomal proteins from hAPP mice, by Western blotting with specific antibodies. Functional enrichment analysis linked S-nitrosylated proteins to various cellular pathways, including: glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, calcium homeostasis, ion, and vesicle transport, suggesting a basic role of this post-translational modification in the regulation of synapses. The linkage of SNO-proteins to axonal guidance and other processes related to APP metabolism exclusively in the hAPP brain, implicates S-nitrosylation in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

24898256|t|Amyloid precursor protein (APP)/APP-like protein 2 (APLP2) expression is required to initiate endosome-nucleus-autophagosome trafficking of glypican-1-derived heparan sulfate.
24898256|a|Anhydromannose (anMan)-containing heparan sulfate (HS) derived from the proteoglycan glypican-1 is generated in endosomes by an endogenously or ascorbate-induced S-nitrosothiolcatalyzed reaction. Processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and APP-like protein 2 (APLP2) by beta- and gamma-secretases into amyloid beta(A) and Abeta-like peptides also takes place in these compartments. Moreover, anMan-containing HS suppresses the formation of toxic Abeta assemblies in vitro. We showed by using deconvolution immunofluorescence microscopy with an anMan-specific monoclonal antibody as well as (35)S labeling experiments that expression of APP/APLP2 is required for ascorbate-induced transport of HS from endosomes to the nucleus. Nuclear translocation was observed in wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (WT MEFs), Tg2576 MEFs, and N2a neuroblastoma cells but not in APP(-/-) and APLP2(-/-) MEFs. Transfection of APP(-/-) cells with a vector encoding APP restored nuclear import of anMan-containing HS. In WT MEFs and N2a neuroblastoma cells exposed to beta- or gamma-secretase inhibitors, nuclear translocation was greatly impeded, suggesting involvement of APP/APLP2 degradation products. In Tg2576 MEFs, the beta-inhibitor blocked transport, but the gamma-inhibitor did not. During chase in ascorbate- free medium, anMan-containing HS disappeared from the nuclei of WT MEFs. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy showed that they appeared in acidic, LC3-positive vesicles in keeping with an autophagosomal location. There was increased accumulation of anMan-containing HS in nuclei and cytosolic vesicles upon treatment with chloroquine, indicating that HS was degraded in lysosomes. Manipulations of APP expression and processing may have deleterious effects upon HS function in the nucleus.

24898636|t|Bombycis excrementum reduces amyloid-beta oligomer-induced memory impairments, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation in mice.
24898636|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of progressive dementia and is characterized by memory impairments, neuronal death, and neuroinflammation. AD-related pathophysiology is caused primarily by the presence of amyloid-beta oligomers (AbetaO). Recently, an increased focus has been directed toward natural compounds or medicinal extracts for the treatment of AD. Extracts from Bombycis excrementum (BE), which is composed of various bioactive constituents and mulberry leaves (the preferred food of silkworms), have been shown to possess anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, and anti-oxidative effects. Additionally, mulberry leaves exert anti-amyloidogenic action and neuroprotective effects against Abeta peptides but it is unknown whether BE has a therapeutic effect on AD-related pathologies. Therefore, the present study examined whether BE inhibits AbetaO-induced memory loss, neuronal death, and inflammation. Behavioral tests revealed that BE significantly ameliorated AbetaO-induced memory impairments and inhibited AbetaO-induced neuronal loss in cultured cells and the brains of mice. BE also significantly inhibited microgliosis and astrogliosis following intra-hippocampal AbetaO injections in mice. Furthermore, BE significantly attenuated the release of nitric oxide from microglia and reduced AbetaO-induced S100-beta cytokine release from activated astrocytes. These results suggest that BE may be a candidate agent for the treatment of AD.

24898644|t|Impact of N-Acetylcysteine on cerebral amyloid-beta plaques and kidney damage in spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats.
24898644|a|BACKGROUND: Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) in spontaneously hypertensive stroke prone rats (SHRSP) is accompanied by parenchymal amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition in the brain and by hypertensive nephropathy with tubulointerstitial damage. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) promotes blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown in SHRSP and may thus accelerate the failure of vascular and perivascular clearance of Abeta. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we test the hypothesis that treatment with NAC increases the cerebral Abeta load and improves renal damage in the SHRSP model. METHODS: A total of 46 SHRSP (ages 18-44 weeks) were treated daily with NAC (12 mg/kg body weight) and 74 no-treated age-matched SHRSP served as controls. The prevalence of parenchymal Abeta load, IgG positive small vessels, and small perivascular bleeds was assessed in different brain regions. Tubulointerstitial kidney damage was assessed through a) the presence of erythrocytes in peritubular capillaries and b) tubular protein cylinders. RESULTS: SHRSP treated with NAC had an age-dependent increase of BBB breakdown (assessed by the presence of IgG positive small vessels) and small perivascular bleeds, mainly in the cortex. NAC significantly increased the Abeta plaque load in the cortex while the number of parenchymal amyloid deposits in the remaining brain areas including basal ganglia, hippocampus, thalamus, and corpus callosum were unchanged. There were no significant treatment effects on tubulointerstitial kidney damage. CONCLUSION: The impact of NAC on cerebral cortical plaque load increase may result from the vascular pathology of SHRSP that accompanies BBB breakdown, leading to the failure of amyloid clearance mechanisms. It remains to be seen whether in humans chronic NAC intake may increase amyloid load in the aging human brain and dementia.

24898658|t|Decreased expression of cathepsin D in monocytes is related to the defective degradation of amyloid-beta in Alzheimer's disease.
24898658|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative dementia characterized by pathological senile plaques composed of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Bone marrow-derived monocytes of patients with AD migrate across the blood-brain barrier into the brain, but are defective at clearing Abeta in the neuritic plaques. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, in patients with AD, we found that cathepsin D, a major lysosomal aspartic protease, was underexpressed in monocytes, resulting in the defective degradation of Abeta by monocytes/macrophages. Further, downregulation of cathepsin D in THP-1 cells significantly reduced the clearance of amyloid plaques in the brain sections of AbetaPP/PS1 mice. The clearance ability was recovered by the overexpression of cathepsin D in AD monocytes. These results suggest that decreased expression of cathepsin D in the peripheral monocytes is a potential signature of AD, and that this decreased expression is involved in Abeta degradation and AD pathogenesis.

24899047|t|Coding variants in TREM2 increase risk for Alzheimer's disease.
24899047|a|The triggering receptor expressed on myeloid 2 (TREM2) is an immune phagocytic receptor expressed on brain microglia known to trigger phagocytosis and regulate the inflammatory response. Homozygous mutations in TREM2 cause Nasu-Hakola disease, a rare recessive form of dementia. A heterozygous TREM2 variant, p.R47H, was recently shown to increase Alzheimer''s disease (AD) risk. We hypothesized that if TREM2 is truly an AD risk gene, there would be additional rare variants in TREM2 that substantially affect AD risk. To test this hypothesis, we performed pooled sequencing of TREM2 coding regions in 2082 AD cases and 1648 cognitively normal elderly controls of European American descent. We identified 16 non-synonymous variants, six of which were not identified in previous AD studies. Two variants, p.R47H [P = 9.17 x 10(-4), odds ratio (OR) = 2.63 (1.44-4.81)] and p.R62H [P = 2.36 x 10(-4), OR = 2.36 (1.47-3.80)] were significantly associated with disease risk in single-variant analyses. Gene-based tests demonstrate variants in TREM2 are genome-wide significantly associated with AD [PSKAT-O = 5.37 x 10(-7); OR = 2.55 (1.80-3.67)]. The association of TREM2 variants with AD is still highly significant after excluding p.R47H [PSKAT-O = 7.72 x 10(-5); OR = 2.47 (1.62-3.87)], indicating that additional TREM2 variants affect AD risk. Genotyping in available family members of probands suggested that p.R47H (P = 4.65 x 10(-2)) and p.R62H (P = 6.87 x 10(-3)) were more frequently seen in AD cases versus controls within these families. Gel electrophoresis analysis confirms that at least three TREM2 transcripts are expressed in human brains, including one encoding a soluble form of TREM2.

24899710|a|An unresolved debate in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is whether amyloid plaques are pathogenic, causing overt physical disruption of neural circuits, or protective, sequestering soluble forms of amyloid-beta (Abeta) that initiate synaptic damage and cognitive decline. Few animal models of AD have been capable of isolating the relative contribution made by soluble and insoluble forms of Abeta to the behavioral symptoms and biochemical consequences of the disease. Here we use a controllable transgenic mouse model expressing a mutant form of amyloid precursor protein (APP) to distinguish the impact of soluble Abeta from that of deposited amyloid on cognitive function and synaptic structure. Rapid inhibition of transgenic APP modulated the production of Abeta without affecting pre-existing amyloid deposits and restored cognitive performance to the level of healthy controls in Morris water maze, radial arm water maze, and fear conditioning. Selective reduction of Abeta with a gamma-secretase inhibitor provided similar improvement, suggesting that transgene suppression restored cognition, at least in part by lowering Abeta. Cognitive improvement coincided with reduced levels of synaptotoxic Abeta oligomers, greater synaptic density surrounding amyloid plaques, and increased expression of presynaptic and postsynaptic markers. Together these findings indicate that transient Abeta species underlie much of the cognitive and synaptic deficits observed in this model and demonstrate that significant functional and structural recovery can be attained without removing deposited amyloid.

24902900|t|Cerium oxide nanoparticles protect against Abeta-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and neuronal cell death.
24902900|a|Evidence indicates that nitrosative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction participate in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid beta (Abeta) and peroxynitrite induce mitochondrial fragmentation and neuronal cell death by abnormal activation of dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), a large GTPase that regulates mitochondrial fission. The exact mechanisms of mitochondrial fragmentation and DRP1 overactivation in AD remain unknown; however, DRP1 serine 616 (S616) phosphorylation is likely involved. Although it is clear that nitrosative stress caused by peroxynitrite has a role in AD, effective antioxidant therapies are lacking. Cerium oxide nanoparticles, or nanoceria, switch between their Ce(3+) and Ce(4+) states and are able to scavenge superoxide anions, hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite. Therefore, nanoceria might protect against neurodegeneration. Here we report that nanoceria are internalized by neurons and accumulate at the mitochondrial outer membrane and plasma membrane. Furthermore, nanoceria reduce levels of reactive nitrogen species and protein tyrosine nitration in neurons exposed to peroxynitrite. Importantly, nanoceria reduce endogenous peroxynitrite and Abeta-induced mitochondrial fragmentation, DRP1 S616 hyperphosphorylation and neuronal cell death.

24903713|t|Intracellular Abeta pathology and early cognitive impairments in a transgenic rat overexpressing human amyloid precursor protein: a multidimensional study.
24903713|a|Numerous studies have implicated the abnormal accumulation of intraneuronal amyloid-beta (Abeta) as an important contributor to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, capable of triggering neuroinflammation, tau hyperphosphorylation and cognitive deficits. However, the occurrence and pathological relevance of intracellular Abeta remain a matter of controversial debate. In this study, we have used a multidimensional approach including high-magnification and super-resolution microscopy, cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) mass spectrometry analysis and ELISA to investigate the Abeta pathology and its associated cognitive impairments, in a novel transgenic rat model overexpressing human APP. Our microscopy studies with quantitative co-localization analysis revealed the presence of intraneuronal Abeta in transgenic rats, with an immunological signal that was clearly distinguished from that of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its C-terminal fragments (CTFs). The early intraneuronal pathology was accompanied by a significant elevation of soluble Abeta42 peptides that paralleled the presence and progression of early cognitive deficits, several months prior to amyloid plaque deposition. Abeta38, Abeta39, Abeta40 and Abeta42 peptides were detected in the rat CSF by MALDI-MS analysis even at the plaque-free stages; suggesting that a combination of intracellular and soluble extracellular Abeta may be responsible for impairing cognition at early time points. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the intraneuronal development of AD-like amyloid pathology includes a mixture of molecular species (Abeta, APP and CTFs) of which a considerable component is Abeta; and that the early presence of these species within neurons has deleterious effects in the CNS, even before the development of full-blown AD-like pathology.

24903778|t|LIMK1 is involved in the protective effects of bone morphogenetic protein 6 against amyloid-beta-induced neurotoxicity in rat hippocampal neurons.
24903778|a|Bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP6) has neuroprotective effects against various neuronal injuries, but its effect on amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced neurotoxicity remains unclear. We exposed rat hippocampal neurons to different concentrations of Abeta25-35 to induce neurotoxicity, and then treated cells with BMP6 to assess the neuroprotective effects. In vivo, we bilaterally injected Abeta1-40 into basal forebrain to simulate the neuropathological process of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and explored changes in the expression of BMP6 and LIMK1. Our data demonstrated that BMP6 prevented apoptosis induced by a high dose of Abeta25-35, and inhibited rod formation induced by low dose of Abeta25-35 in hippocampal neurons. Forebrain injection of Abeta1-40 led to a significant downregulation of BMP6, and inactivation of LIMK1 pathway in basal forebrain, whereas the opposite changes were observed in hippocampus. Our results suggest that BMP6 has neuroprotective effects against Abeta25-35. The BMP6 and LIMK1 pathways may have different expression patterns at different stages of AD, and be self-regulating via a negative feedback mechanism between different brain regions.

24903973|t|Cilostazol suppresses beta-amyloid production by activating a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 via the upregulation of SIRT1-coupled retinoic acid receptor-beta.
24903973|a|The accumulation of plaques of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, results from the sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by activation of beta- and gamma-secretases. However, the production of Abeta can be avoided by alternate cleavage of APP by alpha-and gamma-secretases. We hypothesized that cilostazol attenuates Abeta production by increasing a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10)/alpha-secretase activity via SIRT1-coupled retinoic acid receptor-beta (RARbeta) activation in N2a cells expressing human APP Swedish mutation (N2aSwe). To evoke endogenous Abeta overproduction, the culture medium was switched from medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) to medium containing 1% FBS, and cells were cultured for 3~24 hr. After depletion of FBS in media, N2aSwe cells showed increased accumulations of full-length APP (FL-APP) and Abeta in a time-dependent manner (3-24 hr) in association with decreased ADAM10 protein expression. When pretreated with cilostazol (10-30 muM), FL-APP and Abeta levels were significantly reduced, and ADAM10 and alpha-secretase activities were restored. Furthermore, the effect of cilostazol on ADAM10 expression was antagonized by pretreating Rp-cAMPS and sirtinol and by SIRT1-gene silencing. In the N2aSwe cells overexpressing the SIRT1 gene, ADAM10, and sAPPalpha levels were significantly elevated. In addition, like all-trans retinoic acid, cilostazol enhanced the protein expressions of RARbeta and ADAM10, and the cilostazol-stimulated ADAM10 elevation was significantly attenuated by LE135 (a RARbeta inhibitor), sirtinol, and RARbeta-gene silencing. In conclusion, cilostazol suppresses the accumulations of FL-APP and Abeta by activating ADAM10 via the upregulation of SIRT1-coupled RARbeta.

24906740|t|A glucan isolated from flowers of Lonicera japonica Thunb. inhibits aggregation and neurotoxicity of Abeta42.
24906740|a|Inhibition of Abeta aggregation and attenuation of its cytotoxicity are considered to valuable therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, a glucan named as LJW0F2 was purified from flowers of Lonicera japonica Thunb. Using monosaccharides composition analysis, methylation analysis, IR and NMR spectroscopy, this polysaccharide was elucidated to be an alpha-D-(1 4)-glucan with an alpha-(1 4) linked branch attached to the C-6 position. Its inhibitory effect on Abeta42 aggregation was measured by fluorescence spectroscopic analysis with thioflavine T (ThT) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). We showed that polysaccharide LJW0F2 could inhibit Abeta42 aggregation in a dose-dependent-manner. Besides, LJW0F2 could attenuate the cytotoxicity induced by Abeta42 aggregation in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first report that the exogenous plant-derived polysaccharide might block Abeta42 aggregation directly and reduce its toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells.

24907234|t|Vascular risk and Abeta interact to reduce cortical thickness in AD vulnerable brain regions.
24907234|a|OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to define whether vascular risk factors interact with beta-amyloid (Abeta) in producing changes in brain structure that could underlie the increased risk of Alzheimer disease (AD). METHODS: Sixty-six cognitively normal and mildly impaired older individuals with a wide range of vascular risk factors were included in this study. The presence of Abeta was assessed using [(11)C]Pittsburgh compound B-PET imaging, and cortical thickness was measured using 3-tesla MRI. Vascular risk was measured with the Framingham Coronary Risk Profile Index. RESULTS: Individuals with high levels of vascular risk factors have thinner frontotemporal cortex independent of Abeta. These frontotemporal regions are also affected in individuals with Abeta deposition, but the latter show additional thinning in parietal cortices. Abeta and vascular risk were found to interact in posterior (especially in parietal) brain regions, where Abeta has its greatest effect. In this way, the negative effect of Abeta in posterior regions is increased by the presence of vascular risk. CONCLUSION: Abeta and vascular risk interact to enhance cortical thinning in posterior brain regions that are particularly vulnerable to AD. These findings give insight concerning the mechanisms whereby vascular risk increases the likelihood of developing AD and supports the therapeutic intervention of controlling vascular risk for the prevention of AD.

24907271|t|beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1(BACE1) regulates Notch signaling by controlling the cleavage of Jagged 1 (Jag1) and Jagged 2 (Jag2) proteins.
24907271|a|BACE1 is a type I transmembrane aspartyl protease that cleaves amyloid precursor protein at the beta-secretase site to initiate the release of beta-amyloid peptide. As a secretase, BACE1 also cleaves additional membrane-bound molecules by exerting various cellular functions. In this study, we showed that BACE1 can effectively shed the membrane-anchored signaling molecule Jagged 1 (Jag1).Wealso mapped the cleavage sites of Jag1 by ADAM10 and ADAM17. Although Jag1 shares a high degree of homology with Jag2 in the ectodomain region, BACE1 fails to cleave Jag2 effectively, indicating a selective cleavage of Jag1. Abolished cleavage of Jag1 in BACE1-null mice leads to enhanced astrogenesis and, concomitantly, reduced neurogenesis. This characterization provides biochemical evidence that the Jag1-Notch pathway is under the control of BACE1 activity

24907904|t|An increased neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio in Alzheimer's disease is a function of age and is weakly correlated with neocortical amyloid accumulation.
24907904|a|Inflammation is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Whether directly involved in the pathogenesis, or a downstream consequence of neuronal death, the blood neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is reported to be a putative, non-invasive peripheral biomarker for AD. The aim of this study was to re-evaluate the diagnostic utility of longitudinal measures of the NLR. The NLR was stable across all time-points and weakly correlated with neocortical amyloid burden (R=0.21 at baseline, 0.27 at 18 months, 0.20 at 36 months and 0.10 at 54 months). Cross-sectionally, the NLR was significantly elevated in AD participants as compared to HC participants at baseline (p<0.0001), 18 months (p<0.0001), 36 months (p=0.002) and at 54 months (p=0.007), however only prior to adjustment for age, sex and APOEepsilon4 allele status (p>0.05 at all time-points except for 18 months; p<0.0001). Longitudinally, the NLR was not significantly different between HC and AD participants (p>0.05) adjusted for age, sex and APOEepsilon4 allele status. Comparing the NLR between cognitive transition groups over time (transition towards an AD type dementia), there was no significant difference in the NLR levels between those participants, who did not transition and those participants who did transition, or those in the stable AD group after adjusting for age, sex and APOEepsilon4 allele status (p>0.05). Despite inflammation being a hallmark in AD and previous reports showing that the NLR can discriminate HC from AD patients, our results suggest that the sensitivity of the NLR itself is not robust enough for diagnostic utility. We identified significant relationships cross sectionally (p<0.05 at baseline, 18 months and 36 months) between the NLR and neocortical amyloid burden, but this relationship was lost after longitudinal analyses (p>0.5). The NLR also had limited association with cognitive decline, although in our cohort, the number of participants transitioning was relatively small. In conclusion, the NLR may reflect AD-related inflammatory processes in the periphery, but age and sex are dominant covariates which need to be controlled for in population-based screening.

24908174|t|Human CNS immune senescence and neurodegeneration.
24908174|a|Microglial cells comprising the brain's immune system are essential for ensuring neuroprotection in the normal and pathological CNS. On the basis of histopathological observations in human brain, we believe that the ability of microglia to provide neuroprotection deteriorates as our brains get older and that such CNS immune senescence is a major factor contributing to the development of aging-related neurodegenerative diseases, notably Alzheimer's disease. The idea is consistent with the fact that immune senescence occurs naturally in the periphery, rendering the elderly people more susceptible to infections and cancers. There is an analogous situation in the brain, except that here the main impact comes down to diminished neuroprotection and resultant neurodegeneration.

24908260|t|Health care utilization patterns and costs for patients with hidradenitis suppurativa.
24908260|a|IMPORTANCE: Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic cutaneous disease with acutely painful flares that require appropriate and timely treatment. OBJECTIVE: To assess how individuals with HS utilize medical care, especially emergency department (ED) care, a high-cost setting, and to describe the health care costs for this group. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cohort cost-identification study of 150 493 individuals with claims from the MarketScan medical claims database. Patients with claims for HS and psoriasis (16 736 and 110 266, respectively) and a control group with neither condition (23 491) during the study period, January 2008 to December 2010, were included. EXPOSURES: An HS cohort was formed from all the patients who had 2 or more claims for HS (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision [ICD-9] code 705.83) during the 3-year period. A psoriasis cohort was used as a comparison group, since it is another chronic inflammatory condition with prominent skin findings. This group included randomly selected patients who had 2 or more claims for psoriasis (ICD-9 code 696.1) during the 3-year period. A second control group included randomly selected patients who had no claims for either condition during the 3-year period. From these cohorts only patients that were continuously enrolled for the 3-year period were included. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Health care utilization measures including inpatient length of stay, emergency department and outpatient visits, and number of days supplied of prescription medication were investigated. Cost variables were also investigated and included inpatient, outpatient, emergency department, prescription drug, and total all-cause health care expenditures, which were adjusted for inflation and reported in 2010 US dollars. RESULTS: The largest component of the total 3-year cost for the HS group was inpatient cost (37.4%). In contrast, for the psoriasis group this was drug costs (46.5%) and for the control group, inpatient costs (40.9%). The proportion of people who were hospitalized in the HS cohort (15.8%) was higher than the psoriasis (10.8%) or control (8.6%) groups (P < .001). The proportion of patients who used the ED over the 3-year period was higher in the HS cohort (27.1%) than the psoriasis (17.4%) or control groups (17.2%) (P < .001). Similarly, the mean (SD) 3-year ED cost for the HS group was $2002 ($6632) and was higher than both comparison groups (P < .001). After adjustment for age, sex, and comorbidities, ED utilization remained higher in the HS group compared with the control (P < .001) and psoriasis (P = .02) cohorts. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Hidradenitis suppurativa affects a younger, predominantly female population of patients. High-cost settings, such as ED and inpatient care, are used more frequently for patients with HS. Both patients and clinicians should be aware of this finding, and further research is needed to investigate the impact of health care utilization on patient outcomes.

24909620|t|Amyloid-beta (Abeta1-42)-induced paralysis in Caenorhabditis elegans is reduced by restricted cholesterol supply.
24909620|a|Alzheimer' disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the misfolding and aggregation of amyloid beta (Abeta). This process is influenced through supply of cholesterol via apolipoproteins to neurons. In the present study, we used the transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans strain CL2006, which expresses Abeta1-42 under control of a muscle-specific promoter, to test the effects of the apolipoprotein B homologue vitellogenin-6 on paralysis. Knockdown of vitellogenin-6 using RNA-interference (RNAi) recently was shown to significantly reduce cholesterol absorption in C. elegans, and both, RNAi for vitellogenin-6 or lowering the cholesterol concentration in the medium was associated with reduced Abeta-aggregation and paralysis in the nematodes. The effects of both interventions are mediated through the inhibition of the steroidal-signaling pathway since knockdown of its key factors DAF-9 or DAF-12 reduced paralysis independent of the cholesterol concentration and without additive effects by vitellogenin-6 RNAi. Double-RNAi for daf-12 and the downstream target of insulin-signaling, the foxo transcription factor daf-16, revealed that the paralysis-triggering effects of daf-16 RNAi were dominant over the preventive effects of daf-12 RNAi. Identical observations were made when the transcriptional co-activators of DAF-16, ftt-2 or par-5 were knocked down instead of daf-16. In conclusion, interactions between the steroidal and insulin-signaling pathways were identified in Abeta1-42 expressing CL2006, where cholesterol deprivation inhibits steroidal-signaling and thereby activates DAF-16-signaling. Those effects were associated with a reduced Alzheimer phenotype in the nematodes, i.e. reduced protein aggregation and paralysis.

24910393|t|Amyloid-beta diurnal pattern: possible role of sleep in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.
24910393|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline that is a growing public health crisis with a prevalence projected to more than double in the next 20 years. Sleep is frequently impaired in individuals with AD. Further, recent studies have linked numerous age-related sleep disturbances such as poor sleep efficiency and sleep apnea, to future risk of cognitive impairment. Aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) into extracellular plaques in the brain is a key step in AD pathogenesis and likely begins 20 years before the onset of dementia. Abeta concentrations in both humans and mouse models show Abeta concentrations rise during wakefulness and fall during sleep, that is, an Abeta diurnal pattern. There is evidence in animal models that changes in sleep time alter Abeta deposition, suggesting that sleep may play a role in AD pathogenesis. A hypothetical model for the role of sleep and the Abeta diurnal pattern in AD pathogenesis is proposed.

24911167|t|Detection of amyloid-beta42 using a waveguide-coupled bimetallic surface plasmon resonance sensor chip in the intensity measurement mode.
24911167|a|The waveguide-coupled bimetallic (WcBiM) surface plasmon resonance (SPR) chip had been utilized in the intensity interrogation detection mode to detect amyloid-beta42 (Abeta42), a biomarker of the Alzheimer disease. The SPR reflectance curve of the WcBiM chip has the narrower full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) compared with the SPR reflectance curve of the conventional gold (Au) chip, resulting in the steeper gradient. For the enhancement of resolution, the light source was fixed at an angle where the slope of the reflectance curve is the steepest, and the change in the reflectance was monitored. For the detection of Abeta42, the antibody of Abeta42 (anti-Abeta42) was immobilized on the WcBiM SPR chip using the self-assembled monolayer. The SPR responses, the average changes in the reflectance to the Abeta42 at the concentrations of 100 pg/ml, 250 pg/ml, 500 pg/ml, 750 pg/ml, 1,000 pg/ml, and 2,000 pg/ml were 0.0111%, 0.0305%, 0.0867%, 0.1712%, 0.3021%, and 0.5577%, respectively, for the three replicates. From linear regression analysis, the calibration curve indicated that the SPR response had a linear relation with Abeta42 with the concentration in the range of 100 pg/ml to 2,000 pg/ml. A control experiment showed the anti-Abeta42-modified surface of the WcBiM chip had a high specificity to Abeta42. Thus, the enhanced resolution by utilizing the WcBiM SPR chip in the intensity interrogation detection mode aids the diagnosis of the Alzheimer disease by detecting the Abeta42 around the criteria concentration (500 pg/ml) without any labeling.

24913723|a|BACKGROUND: According to the latest revised National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (now known as the Alzheimer's Association) (NINCDS-ADRDA) diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease dementia of the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer Association, the confidence in diagnosing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease dementia is raised with the application of biomarkers based on measures in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or imaging. These tests, added to core clinical criteria, might increase the sensitivity or specificity of a testing strategy. However, the accuracy of biomarkers in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia and other dementias has not yet been systematically evaluated. A formal systematic evaluation of sensitivity, specificity, and other properties of plasma and CSF amyloid beta (Ass) biomarkers was performed. OBJECTIVES: To determine the accuracy of plasma and CSF Ass levels for detecting those patients with MCI who would convert to Alzheimer's disease dementia or other forms of dementia over time. SEARCH METHODS: The most recent search for this review was performed on 3 December 2012. We searched MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP), BIOSIS Previews (ISI Web of Knowledge), Web of Science and Conference Proceedings (ISI Web of Knowledge), PsycINFO (OvidSP), and LILACS (BIREME). We also requested a search of the Cochrane Register of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies (managed by the Cochrane Renal Group).No language or date restrictions were applied to the electronic searches and methodological filters were not used so as to maximise sensitivity. SELECTION CRITERIA: We selected those studies that had prospectively well defined cohorts with any accepted definition of cognitive decline, but no dementia, with baseline CSF or plasma Ass levels, or both, documented at or around the time the above diagnoses were made. We also included studies which looked at data from those cohorts retrospectively, and which contained sufficient data to construct two by two tables expressing plasma and CSF Ass biomarker results by disease status. Moreover, studies were only selected if they applied a reference standard for Alzheimer's dementia diagnosis, for example the NINCDS-ADRDA or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We screened all titles generated by the electronic database searches. Two review authors independently assessed the abstracts of all potentially relevant studies. We assessed the identified full papers for eligibility and extracted data to create standard two by two tables. Two independent assessors performed quality assessment using the QUADAS-2 tool. Where data allowed, we derived estimates of sensitivity at fixed values of specificity from the model we fitted to produce the summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. MAIN RESULTS: Alzheimer's disease dementia was evaluated in 14 studies using CSF Ass42. Of the 1349 participants included in the meta-analysis, 436 developed Alzheimer's dementia. Individual study estimates of sensitivity were between 36% and 100% while the specificities were between 29% and 91%. Because of the variation in assay thresholds, we did not estimate summary sensitivity and specificity. However, we derived estimates of sensitivity at fixed values of specificity from the model we fitted to produce the summary ROC curve. At the median specificity of 64%, the sensitivity was 81% (95% CI 72 to 87). This equated to a positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of 2.22 (95% CI 2.00 to 2.47) and a negative likelihood ratio (LR-) of 0.31 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.48).The accuracy of CSF Ass42 for all forms of dementia was evaluated in four studies. Of the 464 participants examined, 188 developed a form of dementia (Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia).The thresholds used were between 209 mg/ml and 512 ng/ml. The sensitivities were between 56% and 75% while the specificities were between 47% and 76%. At the median specificity of 75%, the sensitivity was estimated to be 63% (95% CI 22 to 91) from the meta-analytic model. This equated to a LR+ of 2.51 (95% CI 1.30 to 4.86) and a LR- of 0.50 (95% CI 0.16 to 1.51).The accuracy of CSF Ass42 for non-Alzheimer's disease dementia was evaluated in three studies. Of the 385 participants examined, 61 developed non-Alzheimer's disease dementia. Since there were very few studies and considerable variation between studies, the results were not meta-analysed. The sensitivities were between 8% and 63% while the specificities were between 35% and 67%.Only one study examined the accuracy of plasma Ass42 and the plasma Ass42/Ass40 ratio for Alzheimer's disease dementia. The sensitivity of 86% (95% CI 81 to 90) was the same for both tests while the specificities were 50% (95% CI 44 to 55) and 70% (95% CI 64 to 75) for plasma Ass42 and the plasma Ass42/Ass40 ratio respectively. Of the 565 participants examined, 245 developed Alzheimer's dementia and 87 non-Alzheimer's disease dementia.There was substantial heterogeneity between studies. The accuracy of Ass42 for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia did not differ significantly (P = 0.8) between studies that pre-specified the threshold for determining test positivity (n = 6) and those that only determined the threshold at follow-up (n = 8). One study excluded a sample of MCI non-Alzheimer's disease dementia converters from their analysis. In sensitivity analyses, the exclusion of this study had no impact on our findings. The exclusion of eight studies (950 patients) that were considered at high (n = 3) or unclear (n = 5) risk of bias for the patient selection domain also made no difference to our findings. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The proposed diagnostic criteria for prodromal dementia and MCI due to Alzheimer's disease, although still being debated, would be fulfilled where there is both core clinical and cognitive criteria and a single biomarker abnormality. From our review, the measure of abnormally low CSF Ass levels has very little diagnostic benefit with likelihood ratios suggesting only marginal clinical utility. The quality of reports was also poor, and thresholds and length of follow-up were inconsistent. We conclude that when applied to a population of patients with MCI, CSF Ass levels cannot be recommended as an accurate test for Alzheimer's disease.

24914747|t|Testing Abeta toxicity on primary CNS cultures using drug-screening microfluidic chips.
24914747|a|Open microscale cultures of primary central nervous system (CNS) cells have been implemented in microfluidic chips that can expose the cells to physiological fluidic shear stress conditions. Cells in the chips were exposed to differently aggregated forms of beta-amyloid (Abeta), i.e. conditions mimicking an Alzheimer's Disease environment, and treated with CNS drugs in order to assess the contribution of glial cells during pharmacological treatments. FTY720, a drug approved for the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis, was found to play a marked neuroprotective role in neuronal cultures as well as in microglia-enriched neuronal cultures, preventing neurodegeneration after cell exposure to neurotoxic oligomers of Abeta.

24916066|t|Obesity and diabetes cause cognitive dysfunction in the absence of accelerated beta-amyloid deposition in a novel murine model of mixed or vascular dementia.
24916066|a|Mid-life obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) confer a modest, increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), though the underlying mechanisms are unknown. We have created a novel mouse model that recapitulates features of T2DM and AD by crossing morbidly obese and diabetic db/db mice with APPDeltaNL/DeltaNLx PS1P264L/P264L knock-in mice. These mice (db/AD) retain many features of the parental lines (e.g. extreme obesity, diabetes, and parenchymal deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta)). The combination of the two diseases led to additional pathologies-perhaps most striking of which was the presence of severe cerebrovascular pathology, including aneurysms and small strokes. Cortical Abeta deposition was not significantly increased in the diabetic mice, though overall expression of presenilin was elevated. Surprisingly, Abeta was not deposited in the vasculature or removed to the plasma, and there was no stimulation of activity or expression of major Abeta-clearing enzymes (neprilysin, insulin degrading enzyme, or endothelin-converting enzyme). The db/AD mice displayed marked cognitive impairment in the Morris Water Maze, compared to either db/db or APPDeltaNLx PS1P264L mice. We conclude that the diabetes and/or obesity in these mice leads to a destabilization of the vasculature, leading to strokes and that this, in turn, leads to a profound cognitive impairment and that this is unlikely to be directly dependent on Abeta deposition. This model of mixed or vascular dementia provides an exciting new avenue of research into the mechanisms underlying the obesity-related risk for age-related dementia, and will provide a useful tool for the future development of therapeutics.

24916379|t|Genetic dissection reveals that Akt is the critical kinase downstream of LRRK2 to phosphorylate and inhibit FOXO1, and promotes neuron survival.
24916379|a|Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is a complex kinase and mutations in LRRK2 are perhaps the most common genetic cause of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the identification of the normal physiological function of LRRK2 remains elusive. Here, we show that LRRK2 protects neurons against apoptosis induced by the Drosophila genes grim, hid and reaper. Genetic dissection reveals that Akt is the critical downstream kinase of LRRK2 that phosphorylates and inhibits FOXO1, and thereby promotes survival. Like human LRRK2, Drosophila lrrk also promotes neuron survival; lrrk loss-of-function mutant displays reduced cell numbers, which can be rescued by LRRK2 expression. Importantly, LRRK2 G2019S and LRRK2 R1441C mutants impair the ability of LRRK2 to activate Akt, and fail to prevent apoptotic death. Ectopic expression of a constitutive active form of Akt hence is sufficient to rescue this functional deficit. These data establish that LRRK2 can protect neurons from apoptotic insult through a survival pathway in which LRRK2 signals to activate Akt, and then inhibits FOXO1. These results might indicate that a LRRK-Akt therapeutic pathway to promote neuron survival and to prevent neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease.

24916405|t|The N-terminal fragment of the beta-amyloid precursor protein of Alzheimer's disease (N-APP) binds to phosphoinositide-rich domains on the surface of hippocampal neurons.
24916405|a|The function of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) of Alzheimer's disease is poorly understood. The secreted ectodomain fragment of APP (sAPPalpha) can be readily cleaved to produce a small N-terminal fragment (N-APP) that contains heparin-binding and metal-binding domains and that has been found to have biological activity. In the present study, we examined whether N-APP can bind to lipids. We found that N-APP binds selectively to phosphoinositides (PIPs) but poorly to most other lipids. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2 )-rich microdomains were identified on the extracellular surface of neurons and glia in primary hippocampal cultures. N-APP bound to neurons and colocalized with PIPs on the cell surface. Furthermore, the binding of N-APP to neurons increased the level of cell-surface PI(4,5)P2 and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. However, PIPs were not the principal cell-surface binding site for N-APP, because N-APP binding to neurons was not inhibited by a short-acyl-chain PIP analogue, and N-APP did not bind to glial cells which also possessed PI(4,5)P2 on the cell surface. The data are explained by a model in which N-APP binds to two distinct components on neurons, one of which is an unidentified receptor and the second of which is a PIP lipid, which binds more weakly to a distinct site within N-APP. Our data provide further support for the idea that N-APP may be an important mediator of APP's biological activity.

24918635|t|Involvement of matrix metalloproteinase-9 in amyloid-beta 1-42-induced shedding of the pericyte proteoglycan NG2.
24918635|a|Deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) 1-42, the major component of senile plaques characteristic of Alzheimer disease, affects brain microvascular integrity and causes blood-brain barrier dysfunction, increased angiogenesis, and pericyte degeneration. To understand the cellular events underlying Abeta1-42 effects on microvascular alterations, we investigated whether different aggregation forms of Abeta1-42 affect shedding of the pericyte proteoglycan NG2 and whether they affect proteolytic cleavage mediated by matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9. We found decreased levels of soluble NG2, total MMP-9, and MMP-9 activity in pericyte culture supernatants in response to fibril-enriched preparations of Abeta1-42. Conversely, oligomer-enriched preparations of Abeta1-42 increased soluble NG2 levels in the supernatants. This increase was ablated by the MMP-9/MMP-2 inhibitor SB-3CT. There was also a trend toward increased MMP-9 activity observed after oligomeric Abeta1-42 exposure. Our results, demonstrating an Abeta1-42 aggregation-dependent effect on levels of NG2 and MMP-9, support previous studies showing an impact of Abeta1-42 on vascular integrity and thereby add to our understanding of mechanisms behind the microvascular changes commonly found in patients with Alzheimer disease.

24919109|t|Use of amyloid PET across the spectrum of Alzheimer's disease: clinical utility and associated ethical issues.
24919109|a|Abstract Recent advances have made possible the in vivo detection of beta-amyloid (Abeta) pathology using positron emission tomography. While the gold standard for amyloid imaging, carbon-11 labeled Pittsburgh compound B is increasingly being replaced by fluorine-18 labeled radiopharmaceuticals, with three already approved for clinical use by US and European regulatory bodies. Appropriate use criteria proposed by an amyloid imaging taskforce convened by the Alzheimer's Association and the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging recommend restricting use of this technology to the evaluation of patients with mild cognitive impairment or atypical dementia syndromes. While use among asymptomatic individuals is currently viewed as inappropriate due prognostic uncertainty, elevated levels of brain Abeta among asymptomatic individuals may represent preclinical Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid imaging is likewise expected to play a role in the design of clinical trials. Though preliminary results suggest amyloid imaging to possess clinical utility and cost-effectiveness, both domains have yet to be assessed systematically. As the field moves toward adoption of a pro-disclosure stance for amyloid imaging findings, it is imperative that a broad range of stakeholders be involved to ensure the appropriateness of emerging policies and protocols.

24919653|t|Comparing amyloid-beta deposition, neuroinflammation, glucose metabolism, and mitochondrial complex I activity in brain: a PET study in aged monkeys.
24919653|a|PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to compare amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition, translocator protein (TSPO) activity, regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (rCMRglc), and mitochondrial complex I (MC-I) activity in the brain of aged monkeys. METHODS: PET scans with (11)C-PIB (Abeta), (18)F-BCPP-EF (MC-I), (11)C-DPA-713 (TSPO), and (18)F-FDG (rCMRglc) were performed in aged monkeys (Macaca mulatta) in the conscious state and under isoflurane anaesthesia. (11)C-PIB binding to Abeta and (11)C-DPA-713 binding to TSPO were evaluated in terms of standard uptake values (SUV). The total volume of distribution (V T) of (18)F-BCPP-EF and rCMRglc with (18)F-FDG were calculated using arterial blood sampling. RESULTS: Isoflurane did not affect MC-I activity measured in terms of (18)F-BCPP-EF uptake in living brain. There was a significant negative correlation between (18)F-BCPP-EF binding (V T) and (11)C-PIB uptake (SUVR), and there was a significant positive correlation between (11)C-DPA-713 uptake (SUV) and (11)C-PIB uptake. In contrast, there was no significant correlation between rCMRglc ratio and (11)C-PIB uptake. CONCLUSION: (18)F-BCPP-EF could be a potential PET probe for quantitative imaging of impaired MC-I activity that is correlated with Abeta deposition in the living brain.

24920205|t|The use of Surgihoney to prevent or eradicate bacterial colonisation in dressing oncology long vascular lines.
24920205|a|OBJECTIVE: A pilot evaluation was performed to assess the effects of Surgihoney, an engineered honey with highly active antimicrobial activity, on bacterial colonisation in long lines in oncology patients. METHOD: This prospective service evaluation was conducted at Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (HHFT) in England, UK, between 2012 and 2013. The study population consisted of oncology patients with central intravenous lines who were receiving outpatient chemotherapy. All patients were offered line dressing with or without Surgihoney, applied to the line exit site. RESULTS: The primary outcome measure of the study was the presence or absence of bacterial colonisation of the line site. There were 30 patients in each arm - with or without Surgihoney. In the Surgihoney arm, 2 patients with existing line site colonisation were cleared of bacterial colonisation and none acquired colonisation during the study period. In the non-treatment arm, 6 patients were colonised at the line site prior to screening or during the evaluation. Bacterial colonisation was maintained throughout the period. CONCLUSION: Surgihoney is an effective antimicrobial line-site dressing, significantly reducing line site colonisation and eradicating existing colonisation. It was well tolerated by the patients. DECLARATION OF INTEREST: Surgihoney supplies were donated by Healing Honey International (HHI) who also provided some funding to Hampshire Hospitals Foundation Trust for microbiological investigation. MD and JC have provided clinical advice in an advisory capacity to HHI.

24920631|t|Chronic GluN2B antagonism disrupts behavior in wild-type mice without protecting against synapse loss or memory impairment in Alzheimer's disease mouse models.
24920631|a|Extensive evidence implicates GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors (GluN2B-NMDARs) in excitotoxic-insult-induced neurodegeneration and amyloid beta (Abeta)-induced synaptic dysfunction. Therefore, inhibiting GluN2B-NMDARs would appear to be a potential therapeutic strategy to provide neuroprotection and improve cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, there are no reports of long-term in vivo treatment of AD mouse models with GluN2B antagonists. We used piperidine18 (Pip18), a potent and selective GluN2B-NMDAR antagonist with favorable pharmacokinetic properties, for long-term dosing in AD mouse models. Reduced freezing behavior in Tg2576 mice during fear conditioning was partially reversed after subchronic (17 d) Pip18 treatment. However, analysis of freezing behavior in different contexts indicated that this increased freezing likely involves elevated anxiety or excessive memory generalization in both nontransgenic (NTG) and Tg2576 mice. In PS2APP mice chronically fed with medicated food containing Pip18 for 4 months, spatial learning and memory deficits were not rescued, plaque-associated spine loss was not affected, and synaptic function was not altered. At the same time, altered open field activity consistent with increased anxiety and degraded performance in an active avoidance task were observed in NTG after chronic treatment. These results indicate that long-term treatment with a GluN2B-NMDAR antagonist does not provide a disease-modifying benefit and could cause cognitive liabilities rather than symptomatic benefit in AD mouse models. Therefore, these results challenge the expectation of the therapeutic potential for GluN2B-NMDAR antagonists in AD.

24920637|t|CNS amyloid-beta, soluble APP-alpha and -beta kinetics during BACE inhibition.
24920637|a|BACE, a beta-secretase, is an attractive potential disease-modifying therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) as it results directly in the decrease of amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing through the beta-secretase pathway and a lowering of CNS amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels. The interaction of the beta-secretase and alpha-secretase pathway-mediated processing of APP in the rhesus monkey (nonhuman primate; NHP) CNS is not understood. We hypothesized that CNS inhibition of BACE would result in decreased newly generated Abeta and soluble APPbeta (sAPPbeta), with increased newly generated sAPPalpha. A stable isotope labeling kinetics experiment in NHPs was performed with a (13)C6-leucine infusion protocol to evaluate effects of BACE inhibition on CNS APP processing by measuring the kinetics of sAPPalpha, sAPPbeta, and Abeta in CSF. Each NHP received a low, medium, or high dose of MBI-5 (BACE inhibitor) or vehicle in a four-way crossover design. CSF sAPPalpha, sAPPbeta, and Abeta were measured by ELISA and newly incorporated label following immunoprecipitation and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Concentrations, kinetics, and amount of newly generated APP fragments were calculated. sAPPbeta and sAPPalpha kinetics were similar, but both significantly slower than Abeta. BACE inhibition resulted in decreased labeled sAPPbeta and Abeta in CSF, without observable changes in labeled CSF sAPPalpha. ELISA concentrations of sAPPbeta and Abeta both decreased and sAPPalpha increased. sAPPalpha increased by ELISA, with no difference by labeled sAPPalpha kinetics indicating increases in product may be due to APP shunting from the beta-secretase to the alpha-secretase pathway. These results provide a quantitative understanding of pharmacodynamic effects of BACE inhibition on NHP CNS, which can inform about target development.

24922585|t|Activity and architecture of pyroglutamate-modified amyloid-beta (AbetapE3-42) pores.
24922585|a|Among the family of Abeta peptides, pyroglutamate-modified Abeta (AbetapE) peptides are particularly associated with cytotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). They represent the dominant fraction of Abeta oligomers in the brains of AD patients, but their accumulation in the brains of elderly individuals with normal cognition is significantly lower. Accumulation of AbetapE plaques precedes the formation of plaques of full-length Abeta (Abeta1-40/42). Most of these properties appear to be associated with the higher hydrophobicity of AbetapE as well as an increased resistance to enzymatic degradation. However, the important question of whether AbetapE peptides induce pore activity in lipid membranes and their potential toxicity compared with other Abeta pores is still open. Here we examine the activity of AbetapE pores in anionic membranes using planar bilayer electrical recording and provide their structures using molecular dynamics simulations. We find that AbetapE pores spontaneously induce ionic current across the membrane and have some similar properties to the other previously studied pores of the Abeta family. However, there are also some significant differences. The onset of AbetapE3-42 pore activity is generally delayed compared with Abeta1-42 pores. However, once formed, AbetapE3-42 pores produce increased ion permeability of the membrane, as indicated by a greater occurrence of higher conductance electrical events. Structurally, the lactam ring of AbetapE peptides induces a change in the conformation of the N-terminal strands of the AbetapE3-42 pores. While the N-termini of wild-type Abeta1-42 peptides normally reside in the bulk water region, the N-termini of AbetapE3-42 peptides tend to reside in the hydrophobic lipid core. These studies provide a first step to an understanding of the enhanced toxicity attributed to AbetapE peptides.

24923909|t|Tonic inhibition in dentate gyrus impairs long-term potentiation and memory in an Alzheimer's [corrected] disease model.
24923909|a|Amyloid plaques and tau tangles are common pathological hallmarks for Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, reducing Abeta production failed to relieve the symptoms of AD patients. Here we report a high GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) content in reactive astrocytes in the dentate gyrus (DG) of a mouse model for AD (5xFAD) that results in increased tonic inhibition and memory deficit. We also confirm in human AD patient brains that dentate astrocytes have a high GABA content, suggesting that high astrocytic GABA level may be a novel biomarker and a potential diagnostic tool for AD. The excessive GABA in 5xFAD astrocytes is released through an astrocyte-specific GABA transporter GAT3/4, and significantly enhances tonic GABA inhibition in dentate granule cells. Importantly, reducing tonic inhibition in 5xFAD mice rescues the impairment of long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory deficit. Thus, reducing tonic GABA inhibition in the DG may lead to a novel therapy for AD.

24926593|t|Structural heterogeneity in transmembrane amyloid precursor protein homodimer is a consequence of environmental selection.
24926593|a|The 99 amino acid C-terminal fragment of amyloid precursor protein (C99), consisting of a single transmembrane (TM) helix, is known to form homodimers. Homodimers can be processed by gamma-secretase to produce amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein, which is implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). While knowledge of the structure of C99 homodimers is of great importance, experimental NMR studies and simulations have produced varying structural models, including right-handed and left-handed coiled-coils. In order to investigate the structure of this critical protein complex, simulations of the C99(15-55) homodimer in POPC membrane bilayer and DPC surfactant micelle environments were performed using a multiscale approach that blends atomistic and coarse-grained models. The C99(15-55) homodimer adopts a dominant right-handed coiled-coil topology consisting of three characteristic structural states in a bilayer, only one of which is dominant in the micelle. Our structural study, which provides a self-consistent framework for understanding a number of experiments, shows that the energy landscape of the C99 homodimer supports a variety of slowly interconverting structural states. The relative importance of any given state can be modulated through environmental selection realized by altering the membrane or micelle characteristics.

24926647|t|Worse outcomes for patients undergoing brain tumor and cerebrovascular procedures following the ACGME resident duty-hour restrictions.
24926647|a|OBJECT: On July 1, 2003, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) implemented duty-hour restrictions for resident physicians due to concerns for patient and resident safety. Though duty-hour restrictions have increased resident quality of life, studies have shown mixed results with respect to patient outcomes. In this study, the authors have evaluated the effect of duty-hour restrictions on morbidity, mortality, length of stay, and charges in patients who underwent brain tumor and cerebrovascular procedures. METHODS: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample was used to evaluate the effect of duty-hour restrictions on complications, mortality, length of stay, and charges by comparing the pre-reform (2000-2002) and post-reform (2005-2008) periods. Outcomes were compared between nonteaching and teaching hospitals using a difference-in-differences (DID) method. RESULTS: A total of 90,648 patients were included in the analysis. The overall complication rate was 11.7%, with the rates not significantly differing between the pre- and post-duty hour eras (p = 0.26). Examination of hospital teaching status revealed that complication rates decreased in nonteaching hospitals (12.1% vs 10.4%, p = 0.0004) and remained stable in teaching institutions (11.8% vs 11.9%, p = 0.73) in the post-reform era. Multivariate analysis demonstrated a significantly higher complication risk in teaching institutions (OR 1.33 [95% CI 1.11-1.59], p = 0.0022), with no significant change in nonteaching hospitals (OR 1.11 [95% CI 0.91-1.37], p = 0.31). A DID analysis to compare the magnitude in change between teaching and nonteaching institutions revealed that teaching hospitals had a significantly greater increase in complications during the post-reform era than nonteaching hospitals (p = 0.040). The overall mortality rate was 3.0%, with a significant decrease occurring in the post-reform era in both nonteaching (5.0% vs 3.2%, p < 0.0001) and teaching (3.2% vs 2.3%, p < 0.0001) hospitals. DID analysis to compare the changes in mortality between groups did not reveal a significant difference (p = 0.40). The mean length of stay for all patients was 8.7 days, with hospital stay decreasing from 9.2 days to 8.3 days in the post-reform era (p < 0.0001). The DID analysis revealed a greater length of stay decrease in nonteaching hospitals than teaching institutions, which approached significance (p = 0.055). Patient charges significantly increased in the post-reform era for all patients, increasing from $70,900 to $96,100 (p < 0.0001). The DID analysis did not reveal a significant difference between the changes in charges between teaching and nonteaching hospitals (p = 0.17). CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of duty-hour restrictions correlated with an increased risk of postoperative complications for patients undergoing brain tumor and cerebrovascular neurosurgical procedures. Duty-hour reform may therefore be associated with worse patient outcomes, contrary to its intended purpose. Due to the critical condition of many neurosurgical patients, this patient population is most sensitive and likely to be negatively affected by proposed future increased restrictions.

24927710|t|Early neuronal loss and axonal/presynaptic damage is associated with accelerated amyloid-beta accumulation in AbetaPP/PS1 Alzheimer's disease mice subiculum.
24927710|a|The progressive cognitive decline leading to dementia in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients is the consequence of a severe loss of synapses and neurons affecting particular cell subpopulations in selected brain areas, with the subiculum being one of the earliest regions displaying severe atrophy and pathology. The lack of significant neuronal loss in most AD models is, in fact, the major shortcoming for the preclinical evaluation of drugs that could have greater potential in patients to alleviate or prevent this disease. In this study, using immunohistochemical and stereological approaches, we have analyzed the histopathological events in the subiculum of AbetaPP751SwedLondon/PS1M146L mice, a transgenic model that displays neuronal vulnerability at early ages in hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Our results indicate that the subiculum is the earliest affected region in the hippocampus, showing a selective early loss of both principal neurons (28%) and SOM-positive interneurons (69%). In addition, our data demonstrate the existence of an early axonal and synaptic pathology, which may represent the beginning of the synaptic disruption and loss. These neurodegenerative processes occur in parallel, and closely related, with the onset and accelerated progression of the extracellular amyloid-beta deposition, thus suggesting plaques as major contributors of neuronal/axonal damage. Data reported here indicate that this AD model displays a selective AD-like neurodegenerative phenotype in highly vulnerable regions, including the subiculum, and therefore can be a very useful model for testing the therapeutic ability of potential compounds to protect neurons and ameliorate disease symptoms.

24928081|t|Tau protein, beta-amyloid1-42 and clusterin CSF levels in the differential diagnosis of Parkinsonian syndrome with dementia.
24928081|a|BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD), PD with dementia (PDD) and Lewy body dementia (DLB) are synucleinopathies. PDD and DLB are sometimes considered a transition between PD and Alzheimer dementia (AD). Finding in vivo markers or their combination could help in the differential diagnosis of these neurodegenerative (ND) diseases. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of tau protein, betaamyloid1-42 and clusterin and to compare these levels among patients with probable PD, PDD, DLB and AD. METHODS: CSF levels of ND markers were assessed in 96 patients (27 patients with PD, 14 with PDD, 14 with DLB, 17 with AD and 24 subjects as a control group). RESULTS: In all of the groups of patients, beta-amyloid1-42 levels were decreasing in the order PD>PDD>DLB>AD, whereas tau protein and the tau protein/beta-amyloid1-42 index were increasing in the same order (PD<PDD<AD), except for DLB. In paired group comparisons, higher levels of clusterin in PD patients (p=0.005) and PDD patients (p=0.052) compared to the CG were found. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study support the role of clusterin in PD pathogenesis. The decreasing CSF beta-amyloid1-42 levels in the order PDD, DLB and AD may relate to the increasing presence of AD pathology in these disorders.

24928124|t|Symptom onset in autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
24928124|a|OBJECTIVE: To identify factors influencing age at symptom onset and disease course in autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease (ADAD), and develop evidence-based criteria for predicting symptom onset in ADAD. METHODS: We have collected individual-level data on ages at symptom onset and death from 387 ADAD pedigrees, compiled from 137 peer-reviewed publications, the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) database, and 2 large kindreds of Colombian (PSEN1 E280A) and Volga German (PSEN2 N141I) ancestry. Our combined dataset includes 3,275 individuals, of whom 1,307 were affected by ADAD with known age at symptom onset. We assessed the relative contributions of several factors in influencing age at onset, including parental age at onset, age at onset by mutation type and family, and APOE genotype and sex. We additionally performed survival analysis using data on symptom onset collected from 183 ADAD mutation carriers followed longitudinally in the DIAN Study. RESULTS: We report summary statistics on age at onset and disease course for 174 ADAD mutations, and discover strong and highly significant (p < 10(-16), r2 > 0.38) correlations between individual age at symptom onset and predicted values based on parental age at onset and mean ages at onset by mutation type and family, which persist after controlling for APOE genotype and sex. CONCLUSIONS: Significant proportions of the observed variance in age at symptom onset in ADAD can be explained by family history and mutation type, providing empirical support for use of these data to estimate onset in clinical research.

24928203|t|Pre-activated blood platelets and a pro-thrombotic phenotype in APP23 mice modeling Alzheimer's disease.
24928203|a|Platelet activation and thrombus formation play a critical role in primary hemostasis but also represent a pathophysiological mechanism leading to acute thrombotic vascular occlusions. Besides, platelets modulate cellular processes including inflammation, angiogenesis and neurodegeneration. On the other hand, platelet activation and thrombus formation are altered in different diseases leading to either bleeding complications or pathological thrombus formation. For many years platelets have been considered to play a role in neuroinflammatory diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is characterized by deposits of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and strongly related to vascular diseases with platelets playing a critical role in the progression of AD because exposure of platelets to Abeta induces platelet activation, platelet Abeta release, and enhanced platelet adhesion to collagen in vitro and at the injured carotid artery in vivo. However, the molecular mechanisms and the relation between vascular pathology and amyloid-beta plaque formation in the pathogenesis of AD are not fully understood. Compelling evidence is suggestive for altered platelet activity in AD patients. Thus we analyzed platelet activation and thrombus formation in aged AD transgenic mice (APP23) known to develop amyloid-beta deposits in the brain parenchyma and cerebral vessels. As a result, platelets are in a pre-activated state in blood of APP23 mice and showed strongly enhanced integrin activation, degranulation and spreading kinetics on fibrinogen surfaces upon stimulation. This enhanced platelet signaling translated into almost unlimited thrombus formation on collagen under flow conditions in vitro and accelerated vessel occlusion in vivo suggesting that these mice are at high risk of arterial thrombosis leading to cerebrovascular and unexpectedly to cardiovascular complications that might be also relevant in AD patients.

24931598|t|Rational design and identification of a non-peptidic aggregation inhibitor of amyloid-beta based on a pharmacophore motif obtained from cyclo[-Lys-Leu-Val-Phe-Phe-].
24931598|a|Inhibition of pathogenic protein aggregation may be an important and straightforward therapeutic strategy for curing amyloid diseases. Small-molecule aggregation inhibitors of Alzheimer's amyloid-beta (Abeta) are extremely scarce, however, and are mainly restricted to dye- and polyphenol-type compounds that lack drug-likeness. Based on the structure-activity relationship of cyclic Abeta16-20 (cyclo-[KLVFF]), we identified unique pharmacophore motifs comprising side-chains of Leu(2), Val(3), Phe(4), and Phe(5) residues without involvement of the backbone amide bonds to inhibit Abeta aggregation. This finding allowed us to design non-peptidic, small-molecule aggregation inhibitors that possess potent activity. These molecules are the first successful non-peptidic, small-molecule aggregation inhibitors of amyloids based on rational molecular design.

24932696|a|The neurotoxicity of beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and hence the attractive therapeutic strategies focusing on the modulation of Abeta-induced neurotoxicity are warranted. The present study aims to investigate the neuroprotection and underlying mechanisms by which Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (Lamiaceae) extract (SME) protects against Abeta25-35-induced apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells. 2h Pre-treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with SME (0.01, 0.1 or 0.2mg raw herb/ml) concentration-dependently attenuated Abeta25-35-induced cell death, as evidenced by the increase in cell viability and decrease in neuronal apoptosis. In addition, SME suppressed the increased intracellular reactive oxygen species levels, decreased the protein expression of cleaved caspase-3, cytosolic cytochrome c, and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. These findings taken together suggest that SME provides substantial neuroprotection against Abeta25-35-induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells, at least in part, via inhibiting oxidative stress and attenuating the mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway. The approach used in this study may also be useful for the screening of therapeutic agents for AD and other related neurodegenerative disease.

24933538|t|Rosiglitazone prevents the memory deficits induced by amyloid-beta oligomers via inhibition of inflammatory responses.
24933538|a|Rosiglitazone has been known to attenuate neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, Morris water maze test, ELISA and electrophysiological methods were used to examine the role and underling mechanisms of rosiglitazone on Abeta42 oligomer-induced memory impairments. We found that rosiglitazone attenuated Abeta42 oligomer-induced memory impairments in rats in a dose-dependent manner. The levels of inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) and interferon gamma (IFNgamma) were significantly increased 7 days after injection of Abeta42 oligomers into the rat hippocampus. Inhibition of microglia activation prevented Abeta42 oligomer-induced increases in IL-1beta and IFNgamma levels. Rosiglitazone completely prevented the increase in the levels of IL-1beta and IFNgamma induced by Abeta42 oligomers. Treatment of hippocampal slices with the inflammatory cytokine IL-1beta or IFNgamma significantly inhibited the production of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus. Rosiglitazone prevented the inhibitory effects of inflammatory cytokines on LTP. Thus, inhibition of inflammatory responses may be part of the mechanisms of action of rosiglitazone on preventing memory deficits induced by Abeta42 oligmers.

24934601|t|Direct electrochemical and AFM detection of amyloid-beta peptide aggregation on basal plane HOPG.
24934601|a|Amyloidogenesis is associated with more than 30 human diseases, including Alzheimer's which is related to aggregation of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta). Here, consecutive stages of Abeta42 aggregation and amyloid fibril formation were followed electrochemically via oxidation of tyrosines in Abeta42 adsorbed on the basal plane graphite electrode and directly correlated with Abeta42 morphological changes observed by atomic force microscopy of the same substrate. The results offer new tools for analysis of mechanisms of Abeta aggregation.

24935788|t|Disease-modifying anti-Alzheimer's drugs: inhibitors of human cholinesterases interfering with beta-amyloid aggregation.
24935788|a|AIMS: We recently described multifunctional tools (2a-c) as potent inhibitors of human Cholinesterases (ChEs) also able to modulate events correlated with Abeta aggregation. We herein propose a thorough biological and computational analysis aiming at understanding their mechanism of action at the molecular level. METHODS: We determined the inhibitory potency of 2a-c on Abeta1-42 self-aggregation, the interference of 2a with the toxic Abeta oligomeric species and with the postaggregation states by capillary electrophoresis analysis and transmission electron microscopy. The modulation of Abeta toxicity was assessed for 2a and 2b on human neuroblastoma cells. The key interactions of 2a with Abeta and with the Abeta-preformed fibrils were computationally analyzed. 2a-c toxicity profile was also assessed (human hepatocytes and mouse fibroblasts). RESULTS: Our prototypical pluripotent analogue 2a interferes with Abeta oligomerization process thus reducing Abeta oligomers-mediated toxicity in human neuroblastoma cells. 2a also disrupts preformed fibrils. Computational studies highlighted the bases governing the diversified activities of 2a. CONCLUSION: Converging analytical, biological, and in silico data explained the mechanism of action of 2a on Abeta1-42 oligomers formation and against Abeta-preformed fibrils. This evidence, combined with toxicity data, will orient the future design of safer analogues.

24936678|t|Radioiodinated benzyloxybenzene derivatives: a class of flexible ligands target to beta-amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's brains.
24936678|a|Benzyloxybenzene, as a novel flexible scaffold without rigid planarity, was synthesized and evaluated as ligand toward Abeta plaques. The binding site calculated for these flexible ligands was the hydrophobic Val18_Phe20 channel on the flat surface of Abeta fiber. Structure-activity relationship analysis generated a common trend that binding affinities declined significantly from para-substituted ligands to ortho-substituted ones, which was also quantitatively illustrated by 3D-QSAR modeling. Autoradiography in vitro further confirmed the high affinities of radioiodinated ligands [125I]4, [125I]24, and [125I]22 (Ki=24.3, 49.4, and 17.6 nM, respectively). In biodistribution, [125I]4 exhibited high initial uptake and rapid washout property in the brain with brain2 min/brain60 min ratio of 16.3. The excellent in vitro and in vivo biostability of [125I]4 enhanced its potential for clinical application in SPECT imaging of Abeta plaques. This approach could also allow the design of a new generation of Abeta targeting ligands without rigid and planar framework.

24938499|t|CHF5074 protects SH-SY5Y human neuronal-like cells from amyloidbeta 25-35 and tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand toxicity in vitro.
24938499|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is contributed by multiple pathogenic causes. The anomalous protein amyloid-beta (Abeta) is regarded as a pivotal factor in AD, and originates from enzymatic cleavage of a precursor protein by the secretase family. 1-(3',4'-Dichloro-2-fluoro[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl)-cyclopropanecarboxylic acid (CHF5074) is a non-steroidal antiinflammatory derivative able to inhibit Abeta deposition in the brain of transgenic mouse models of AD. The proapoptotic cytokine TRAIL has been reported to mediate Abeta-dependent neurotoxicity. Here, the effects of CHF5074 on Abeta25-35- triggered TRAIL toxicity were evaluated in the differentiated human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y in vitro. Cells were pre-treated 1h with CHF5074 at graded concentrations (range: 1 nM-1 uM) and then challenged for 72 h with either Abeta25-35 or TRAIL. Results show that CHF5074 treatment prevented apoptotic death in SH-SY5Y cell line in a concentration- dependent fashion. Its maximally active concentration was 10 nM. Then, investigation of related molecular mechanisms underlying such protective effect of CHF5074 suggested that the levels of caspases, as well as of various kinases, including stress and MAP kinases, are modulated by CHF5074. Finally, treatment of injured human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y with CHF5074 resulted in prominent protection from apoptotic death. The bulk of these data suggest that CHF5074 represents a potential candidate for pharmacological neuroprotective treatment in neurodegenerative disorders.

24938503|t|Association of SORL1 gene variants with hippocampal and cerebral atrophy and Alzheimer's disease.
24938503|a|BACKGROUND: Sortilin-related receptor, Sorl1, is a neuronal receptor that interacts with the amyloid precursor protein to regulate amyloidogenesis. Variants in the gene encoding Sorl1 are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as its neuroimaging markers. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between SORL1 gene variants with ADrelated brain morphologies and AD, testing for sex-specific effects. METHODS: The sample comprised 292 individuals aged >= 75 years participating in the longitudinal Sydney Older Persons Study. A sub-sample also underwent a brain MRI scan (n=102, 53 males; 49 females). The relationships of three SORL1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): rs4935774, rs2298813, rs1133174 with brain MRI measures, and AD were determined. RESULTS: Significant associations of SORL1 variants with cross-sectional brain MRI measures and AD were observed only when the sample was stratified by sex. The most common haplotype (H1), comprising rs4935774-T, rs2298813-G, and rs1133174-G alleles (T/G/G) was associated with whole brain atrophy in both males and females (p=0.012 & p=0.013; respectively). Only SNP rs1133174 was individually associated with hippocampal atrophy in males (p= 0.039) and females (p=0.025). Of the 292 participants, 111 had either probable or possible AD. A significant association of H1 with AD (p = 0.017) was observed in females. A nominally significant association of SNP rs1133174 with AD (p = 0.051) was also observed in the whole cohort. CONCLUSION: The results provide evidence that the association of polymophisms in the sortilin-related receptor gene (SORL1) with AD and its MRI biomarkers of brain and hippocampal atrophy are moderated by sex.

24938782|t|Differences in nucleation behavior underlie the contrasting aggregation kinetics of the Abeta40 and Abeta42 peptides.
24938782|a|The two major forms of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide found in plaques in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease, Abeta40 and Abeta42, only differ by two amino acids in the C-terminal region, yet they display markedly different aggregation behavior. The origins of these differences have remained challenging to connect to specific molecular-level processes underlying the aggregation reaction. In this paper we use a general strategy to apply the conventional workflow of chemical kinetics to the aggregation of the Abeta40 peptide to identify the differences between Abeta40 and Abeta42 in terms of the microscopic determinants of the aggregation reaction. Our results reveal that the major source of aggregates in the case of Abeta40 is a fibril-catalyzed nucleation process, the multistep nature of which is evident through its saturation behavior. Moreover, our results show that the significant differences in the observed behavior of the two proteins originate not simply from a uniform increase in all microscopic rates for Abeta42 compared with Abeta40, but rather are due to a shift of more than one order of magnitude in the relative importance of primary nucleation versus fibril-catalyzed secondary nucleation processes. This analysis sheds light on the microscopic determinants of the aggregation behavior of the principal forms of Abeta and outlines a general approach toward achieving an understanding at the molecular level of the aberrant deposition of insoluble peptides in neurodegenerative disorders.

24941111|t|Pen-2 is essential for gamma-secretase complex stability and trafficking but partially dispensable for endoproteolysis.
24941111|a|The 19-transmembrane gamma-secretase complex generates the amyloid beta-peptide of Alzheimer's disease by intramembrane proteolysis of the beta-amyloid precursor protein. This complex is comprised of presenilin, Aph1, nicastrin, and Pen-2. The exact function and mechanism of the highly conserved Pen-2 subunit remain poorly understood. Using systematic mutagenesis, we confirm and extend our understanding of which key regions and specific residues play roles in various aspects of gamma-secretase function, including maturation, localization, and activity, but not processivity. In general, mutations (1) within the first half of transmembrane domain (TMD) 1 of Pen-2 decreased PS1 endoproteolysis and gamma-secretase proteolytic activity, (2) within the second half of TMD1 increased proteolytic activity, (3) within the cytosolic loop region decreased proteolytic activity, (4) within TMD2 decreased PS1 endoproteolysis, (5) within the first half of TMD2 decreased proteolytic activity, and (6) within C-terminal residues decreased proteolytic activity. Specific mutational effects included N33A in TMD1 causing an increase in gamma-secretase complexes at the cell surface and a modest decrease in stability and the previously unreported I53A mutation in the loop region reducing stability 10-fold and proteolytic activity by half. In addition, we confirm that minor PS1 endoproteolysis can occur in the complete absence of Pen-2. Together, these data suggest that rather than solely being a catalyst for gamma-secretase endoproteolysis, Pen-2 may also stabilize the complex prior to PS1 endoproteolysis, allowing time for full assembly and proper trafficking.

24941267|t|Simultaneous imaging of amyloid-beta and lipids in brain tissue using antibody-coupled liposomes and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry.
24941267|a|The spatial localization of amyloid-beta peptide deposits, the major component of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD), was mapped in transgenic AD mouse brains using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), simultaneously with several endogenous molecules that cannot be mapped using conventional immunohistochemistry imaging, including phospholipids, cholesterol and sulfatides. Whereas the endogenous lipids were detected directly, the amyloid-beta deposits, which cannot be detected as intact entities with ToF-SIMS because of extensive ion-induced fragmentation, were identified by specific binding of deuterated liposomes to antibodies directed against amyloid-beta. Comparative investigation of the amyloid-beta deposits using conventional immunohistochemistry and fluorescence microscopy suggests similar sensitivity but a more surface-confined identification due to the shallow penetration depth of the ToF-SIMS signal. The recorded ToF-SIMS images thus display the localization of lipids and amyloid-beta in a narrow (~10 nm) two-dimensional plane at the tissue surface. As compared to a frozen nontreated tissue sample, the liposome preparation protocol generally increased the signal intensity of endogenous lipids, likely caused by matrix effects associated with the removal of salts, but no severe effects on the tissue integrity and the spatial distribution of lipids were observed with ToF-SIMS or scanning electron microscopy (SEM). This method may provide an important extension to conventional tissue imaging techniques to investigate the complex interplay of different kinds of molecules in neurodegenerative diseases, in the same specimen. However, limitations in target accessibility of the liposomes as well as unspecific binding need further consideration.

24942339|t|Trained or professional doulas in the support and care of pregnant and birthing women: a critical integrative review.
24942339|a|The professionalisation of doula care and research interest in this area of maternity care/support have both grown internationally in recent years highlighting important broader issues around the access, continuity and delivery of maternity care services. However, no work to date has provided a critical appraisal of the international literature on this topic. In response, this paper presents the first critical review of international empirical literature examining professional doula care for pregnant and birthing women. A database search of AMED, CINAHL, Maternity and Infant Care, and MEDLINE using the search term, "doula" was undertaken. A total of 48 papers published between 1980 and March 2013 involving trained or professional doulas were extracted. Four descriptive categories were identified from the review: 'workforce and professional issues in doula care'; 'trained or professional doula's role and skill'; 'physical outcomes of trained or professional doula care'; and 'social outcomes of trained or professional doula care'. Of the studies evaluating outcomes of doula care, there were a number with design and methodology weaknesses. The review highlights a number of gaps in the research literature including a lack of research examining doula workforce issues; focus upon the experience and perspective of significant stakeholders such as expectant fathers with regard to trained or professional doula care; clinical trials measuring both subjective experiences and physical outcomes of trained or professional doula support; synergy between the design of clinical trials research examining trained or professional doula care and the clinical reality of professional doula practice. It is imperative that key aspects of trained doula care be subject to further rigorous, empirical investigation to help establish an evidence base to guide policy and practice relating to this area of support and care for pregnant and birthing women.

24944784|t|Genetic testing can resolve diagnostic confusion in Alport syndrome.
24944784|a|Alport syndrome (AS) is a familial glomerular disorder resulting from mutations in the genes encoding several members of the type IV collagen protein family. Despite advances in molecular genetics, renal biopsy remains an important initial diagnostic tool. Histological diagnosis is challenging as features may be non-specific, particularly early in the disease course and in females with X-linked disease. We present three families for whom there was difficulty in correctly diagnosing AS or thin basement membrane nephropathy as a result of misinterpretation of non-specific and incomplete histology. We highlight the importance of electron microscopy and immunofluorescence in improving diagnostic yield and also the hazard of interpreting a descriptive histological term as a diagnostic label. Molecular genetic testing allows a definitive diagnosis to be made in index patients and at-risk family members.

24946073|t|APOE and BDNF Val66Met polymorphisms combine to influence episodic memory function in older adults.
24946073|a|Genetic polymorphisms of apolipoprotein E (APOE) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) have shown inconsistent associations with healthy adult cognitive functions. Recent investigations have suggested that APOE polymorphisms do not contribute to non-pathological cognitive function and that any effect is likely due to prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD). Similarly, although BDNF Val66Met polymorphisms affect hippocampal morphology and function, associations with learning and/or memory have not always been found. This study sought to determine whether APOE and BDNF polymorphisms were associated, either independently or in combination, with adult cognition. Comprehensive neuropsychological assessments were conducted on 433 older adults, aged 50-79 years (M=62.16, SD=6.81), which yielded measures of episodic memory, working memory, executive function, and language processing. Participants underwent comprehensive neuropsychological assessment to ensure that only cognitively intact individuals comprised the sample. APOE and BDNF polymorphic data were used as predictors in general linear models that assessed composite cognitive domain variables, while covarying for education and age. Although no main effects for APOE or BDNF were found, the analysis identified a significant APOExBDNF interaction that predicted episodic memory performance (p=.02, eta(2)=.02). Post-hoc analyses demonstrated that in BDNF Val homozygotes, the cognitive consequences of APOE polymorphisms were minimal. However, in BDNF Met carriers, the hypothesized beneficial/detrimental effects of APOE polymorphisms were found. Our data show that concurrent consideration of both APOE and BDNF polymorphisms are required in order to witness a cognitive effect in healthy older adults.

24946075|t|The pericyte: a forgotten cell type with important implications for Alzheimer's disease?
24946075|a|Pericytes are cells in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) that degenerate in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by early neurovascular dysfunction, elevation of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta), tau pathology and neuronal loss, leading to progressive cognitive decline and dementia. Pericytes are uniquely positioned within the neurovascular unit between endothelial cells of brain capillaries, astrocytes and neurons. Recent studies have shown that pericytes regulate key neurovascular functions including BBB formation and maintenance, vascular stability and angioarchitecture, regulation of capillary blood flow, and clearance of toxic cellular by-products necessary for normal functioning of the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we review the concept of the neurovascular unit and neurovascular functions of CNS pericytes. Next, we discuss vascular contributions to AD and review new roles of pericytes in the pathogenesis of AD such as vascular-mediated Abeta-independent neurodegeneration, regulation of Abeta clearance and contributions to tau pathology, neuronal loss and cognitive decline. We conclude that future studies should focus on molecular mechanisms and pathways underlying aberrant signal transduction between pericytes and its neighboring cells within the neurovascular unit, that is, endothelial cells, astrocytes and neurons, which could represent potential therapeutic targets to control pericyte degeneration in AD and the resulting secondary vascular and neuronal degeneration.

24946940|t|Effects of analog P165 of amyloid precursor protein 5-mer peptide on learning, memory and brain insulin receptors in the rat model of cognitive decline.
24946940|a|We aim to study the therapeutic efficacy of analog P165 of amyloid precursor protein 5-mer peptide in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced cognitive decline model. Rats were divided into four groups: control, STZ, STZ+P165, and STZ+rosiglitazone (RSG). STZ model was established by intracerebroventricular injection of STZ. Three weeks following surgery, rats received daily gavage administration of distilled water (control and STZ groups), P165 (STZ+P165), or RSG (STZ+RSG) for four consecutive weeks. Learning and memory abilities were assessed with the Morris water maze test. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) was detected by ELISA. Expressions of insulin receptor-beta (IR-beta), insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), serine/threonine kinase (Akt), and phosphorylation of CREB (p-CREB) were observed by immunohistochemistry. Both P165 and RSG significantly reduced the escape latency relative to the STZ group (P165, P < 0.05; RSG, P < 0.01). STZ model rats had reduced levels of IGF-1 relative to control, and this deficit was attenuated in the STZ+P165 group (P < 0.01). IR and IRS-1 were elevated in STZ rats, and these levels were restored to near control in the STZ+P165 and STZ+RSG groups (P < 0.01). Our findings demonstrate that P165 and RSG improved hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory in STZ rats by regulating the insulin signaling pathway.

24947293|t|Persistent racial disparity in stroke hospitalization and economic impact in young adults in the buckle of stroke belt.
24947293|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Mounting evidence points to a decline in stroke incidence. However, little is known about recent patterns of stroke hospitalization within the buckle of the stroke belt. This study aims to investigate the age- and race-specific secular trends in stroke hospitalization rates, inpatient stroke mortality rates, and related hospitalization charges during the past decade in South Carolina. METHODS: Patients from 2001 to 2010 were identified from the State Inpatient Hospital Discharge Database with a primary discharge diagnosis of stroke (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes: 430-434, 436, 437.1). Age- and race-stroke-specific hospitalization rates, hospital charges, charges associated with racial disparity, and 30-day stroke mortality rates were compared between blacks and whites. RESULTS: Of the 84,179 stroke hospitalizations, 31,137 (37.0%) were from patients aged<65 years and 29,846 (35.5%) were blacks. Stroke hospitalization rates decreased in the older population (aged>=65 years) for both blacks and whites (P<0.001) but increased among the younger group (aged<65 years; P=0.004); however, this increase was mainly driven by a 17.3% rise among blacks (P=0.001), with no difference seen among whites (P=0.84). Of hospital charges totaling $2.77 billion, $453.2 million (16.4%) are associated with racial disparity (79.6% from patients aged<65 years). Thirty-day stroke mortality rates decreased in all age-race-stroke-specific groups (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The stroke hospitalization rate increased in the young blacks only, which results in a severe and persistent racial disparity. It highlights the urgent need for a racial disparity reduction in the younger population to alleviate the healthcare burden.

24947303|t|Amyloid-beta (1-40) restores adhesion properties of pulmonary surfactant, counteracting the effect of cholesterol.
24947303|a|A pulmonary surfactant (PS) is a thin lipid-protein film covering the surface of the lung alveoli at the air/liquid interface. The primary purpose of a PS is to control the surface tension of the air/liquid interface and to reduce the work of breathing. High levels of cholesterol in a PS are associated with life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI). Finding therapeutics to counteract the effect of cholesterol in a PS is a matter of contemporary research. In our earlier work, we showed that the addition of amyloid-beta (1-40) (Abeta40), the protein implicated in Alzheimer's disease, can reverse the detrimental effects of cholesterol in surfactants by improving multilayer formation and restoring PS surface active properties. We hypothesized that this phenomenon was due to Abeta40 improving adhesion properties of a surfactant. In this work we used atomic force spectroscopy to demonstrate that Abeta40 counteracts the adhesive properties of a PS compromised by high levels of cholesterol in a PS and helps to restore the functionality of a PS.

24947815|t|Intracellular selection of peptide inhibitors that target disulphide-bridged Abeta42 oligomers.
24947815|a|The beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide aggregates into a number of soluble and insoluble forms, with soluble oligomers thought to be the primary factor implicated in Alzheimer's disease pathology. As a result, a wide range of potential aggregation inhibitors have been developed. However, in addition to problems with solubility and protease susceptibility, many have inadvertently raised the concentration of these soluble neurotoxic species. Sandberg et al. previously reported a beta-hairpin stabilized variant of Abeta42 that results from an intramolecular disulphide bridge (A21C/A31C; Abeta42cc), which generates highly toxic oligomeric species incapable of converting into mature fibrils. Using an intracellular protein-fragment complementation (PCA) approach, we have screened peptide libraries using E. coli that harbor an oxidizing environment to permit cytoplasmic disulphide bond formation. Peptides designed to target either the first or second beta-strand have been demonstrated to bind to Abeta42cc, lower amyloid cytotoxicity, and confer bacterial cell survival. Peptides have consequently been tested using wild-type Abeta42 via ThT binding assays, circular dichroism, MTT cytotoxicity assays, fluorescence microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. Results demonstrate that amyloid-PCA selected peptides function by both removing amyloid oligomers as well as inhibiting their formation. These data further support the use of semirational design combined with intracellular PCA methodology to develop Abeta antagonists as candidates for modification into drugs capable of slowing or even preventing the onset of AD.

24948534|t|The Abeta peptides-activated calcium-sensing receptor stimulates the production and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor-A by normoxic adult human cortical astrocytes.
24948534|a|The excess vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) produced in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain can harm neurons, blood vessels, and other components of the neurovascular units (NVUs). But could astrocytes partaking in networks of astrocyte-neuron teams and connected to blood vessels of NVUs contribute to VEGF production? We have shown with cultured cerebral cortical normal (i.e., untransformed) adult human astrocytes (NAHAs) that exogenous amyloid-beta peptides (Abetas) stimulate the astrocytes to make and secrete large amounts of Abetas and nitric oxide by a mechanism mediated through the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). Here, we report that exogenous Abetas stimulate the NAHAs to produce and secrete even VEGF-A through a CaSR-mediated mechanism. This is indicated by the ability of Abetas to specifically bind the CaSR, and the capability of a CaSR activator, the "calcimimetic" NPS R-568, to imitate, and of the CaSR antagonist, "calcilytic" NPS 2143, to inhibit, the Abetas stimulation of VEGF-A production and secretion by the NAHAs. Thus, Abetas that accumulate in the AD brain may make the astrocytes that envelop and functionally collaborate with neurons into multi-agent AD-driving "machines" via a CaSR signaling mechanism(s). These observations suggest the possibility that CaSR allosteric antagonists such as NPS 2143 might impede AD progression.

24948815|t|Gene-environment interactions: lifetime cognitive activity, APOE genotype, and beta-amyloid burden.
24948815|a|Carriers of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele, the major genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), harbor an increased load of beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaque burden that is felt to be a major instigator of AD development. Data has suggested that lifestyle factors may reduce AD risk by directly mitigating Abeta pathology, which could be particularly beneficial in APOE epsilon4 carriers. We therefore examined the interaction between lifetime cognitive activity and the APOE epsilon4 allele in relation to brain Abeta burden. We obtained measures of lifetime cognitive activity in 118 cognitively normal human individuals (mean age: 76.13 +- 5.56 years, 70 women) using a validated questionnaire that included measures over early, middle, and current age epochs. Hierarchical regression models (adjusted for age, gender, and years of education) were conducted to examine effects of APOE epsilon4 carrier status, lifetime cognitive activity, and the interaction of the two factors with cortical Abeta deposition, quantified using [11C] Pittsburgh-compound-B (PIB)-PET. As expected, the epsilon4 carriers exhibited higher PIB retention compared with noncarriers. Lifetime cognitive activity moderated the APOE genotype effect such that cortical PIB retention was diminished in epsilon4 carriers that reported higher cognitive activity over the life course. The findings suggest that greater lifetime cognitive activity may forestall AD pathology, specifically in genetically susceptible individuals. The effect could imply that cognitive training promotes increased neural efficiency that might retard the lifelong neurally mediated deposition of Abeta.

24949598|t|Expression of amyloid-beta protein and amyloid-beta precursor protein after primary brain-stem injury in rats.
24949598|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein and its precursor, amyloid-beta precursor protein (beta-APP), have traditionally been used in the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease. Their use in diagnosis of traumatic brain injury by forensic analysis is becoming more widespread. However, to date, no reliable small animal model exists to evaluate these brain injury indicators. To address this, we have studied primary brain-stem injury in rats to assess the appearance of diffuse axonal injury in brain sections and correlate these findings with appearance of Abeta and relative beta-APP mRNA levels. Using an EnVision 2-step immunohistochemical staining method to measure axon diameter, we found that there was significant difference in axon diameters within the medulla oblongata and several time points after brain injury, ranging from 3 to 24 hours. In addition, mRNA expression levels of beta-APP increased following brain injury, peaking 3 hours following injury and decreasing back to baseline levels by 24 hours after injury. These results suggest that using immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to detect changes in Abeta-associated axonal changes and beta-APP mRNA levels, respectively, can be useful for the diagnosis of diffuse axonal injury during autopsy at early time points following fatal brain injury.

24950761|t|Role of the fast kinetics of pyroglutamate-modified amyloid-beta oligomers in membrane binding and membrane permeability.
24950761|a|Membrane permeability to ions and small molecules is believed to be a critical step in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Interactions of oligomers formed by amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides with the plasma cell membrane are believed to play a fundamental role in the processes leading to membrane permeability. Among the family of Abetas, pyroglutamate (pE)-modified Abeta peptides constitute the most abundant oligomeric species in the brains of AD patients. Although membrane permeability mechanisms have been studied for full-length Abeta1-40/42 peptides, these have not been sufficiently characterized for the more abundant AbetapE3-42 fragment. Here we have compared the adsorbed and membrane-inserted oligomeric species of AbetapE3-42 and Abeta1-42 peptides. We find lower concentrations and larger dimensions for both species of membrane-associated AbetapE3-42 oligomers. The larger dimensions are attributed to the faster self-assembly kinetics of AbetapE3-42, and the lower concentrations are attributed to weaker interactions with zwitterionic lipid headgroups. While adsorbed oligomers produced little or no significant membrane structural damage, increased membrane permeabilization to ionic species is understood in terms of enlarged membrane-inserted oligomers. Membrane-inserted AbetapE3-42 oligomers were also found to modify the mechanical properties of the membrane. Taken together, our results suggest that membrane-inserted oligomers are the primary species responsible for membrane permeability.

24951455|t|Alzheimer's disease risk genes and mechanisms of disease pathogenesis.
24951455|a|We review the genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their role in AD pathogenesis. More recent advances in understanding of the human genome-technologic advances in methods to analyze millions of polymorphisms in thousands of subjects-have revealed new genes associated with AD risk, including ABCA7, BIN1, CASS4, CD33, CD2AP, CELF1, CLU, CR1, DSG2, EPHA1, FERMT2, HLA-DRB5-DBR1, INPP5D, MS4A, MEF2C, NME8, PICALM, PTK2B, SLC24H4-RIN3, SORL1, and ZCWPW1. Emerging technologies to analyze the entire genome in large data sets have also revealed coding variants that increase AD risk: PLD3 and TREM2. We review the relationship between these AD risk genes and the cellular and neuropathologic features of AD. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the association of these genes with risk for disease will provide the most meaningful targets for therapeutic development to date.

24952745|t|Genetic association study of QT interval highlights role for calcium signaling pathways in myocardial repolarization.
24952745|a|The QT interval, an electrocardiographic measure reflecting myocardial repolarization, is a heritable trait. QT prolongation is a risk factor for ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD) and could indicate the presence of the potentially lethal mendelian long-QT syndrome (LQTS). Using a genome-wide association and replication study in up to 100,000 individuals, we identified 35 common variant loci associated with QT interval that collectively explain ~8-10% of QT-interval variation and highlight the importance of calcium regulation in myocardial repolarization. Rare variant analysis of 6 new QT interval-associated loci in 298 unrelated probands with LQTS identified coding variants not found in controls but of uncertain causality and therefore requiring validation. Several newly identified loci encode proteins that physically interact with other recognized repolarization proteins. Our integration of common variant association, expression and orthogonal protein-protein interaction screens provides new insights into cardiac electrophysiology and identifies new candidate genes for ventricular arrhythmias, LQTS and SCD.

24952994|t|Cerebrospinal fluid sphingolipids, beta-amyloid, and tau in adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease.
24952994|a|Cellular studies suggest sphingolipids may cause or accelerate amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau pathology but in vivo human studies are lacking. We determined cerebrospinal fluid levels of sphingolipids (ceramides and sphingomyelins), amyloid-beta (Abeta1-42, AbetaX-38, AbetaX-40, and AbetaX-42) and tau (T-tau and p-tau181) in 91 cognitively normal individuals, aged 36-69 years, with a parental history of Alzheimer's disease. The 18-carbon acyl chain length ceramide species was associated with AbetaX-38 (r = 0.312, p = 0.003), AbetaX-40 (r = 0.327, p = 0.002), and T-tau (r = 0.313, p = 0.003) but not with AbetaX-42 (r = 0.171, p = 0.106) or p-tau (r = 0.086, p = 0.418). All sphingomyelin species correlated (most p < 0.001) with all Abeta species and T-tau; many also correlated with p-tau. Results remained in regression models after controlling for age and APOE genotype. These results suggest in vivo relationships between cerebrospinal fluid ceramides and sphingomyelins and Abeta and tau levels in cognitively normal individuals at increased risk for Alzheimer's disease, indicating these sphingolipids may be associated with early pathogenesis.

24954831|t|Norepinephrine provides short-term neuroprotection against Abeta1-42 by reducing oxidative stress independent of Nrf2 activation.
24954831|a|Pathophysiological evidence correlating locus ceruleus neuron loss with increased Alzheimer's disease pathology suggests that norepinephrine (NE) is neuroprotective. Here, we evaluated the effects of NE on amyloid-beta (Abeta)1-42-induced neurotoxicity and determined how NE exerts its actions in human SK-N-SH neurons. NE protected SK-N-SH cells against Abeta1-42-induced neurotoxicity only after a 4-hour treatment. The ability of NE to reduce Abeta1-42-induced neurotoxicity was independent of the adrenoceptor signaling pathway. Notably, NE downregulated Abeta1-42-mediated increases in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. However, NE did not affect Abeta1-42-induced activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) redox signaling pathway, known to be involved in oxidative stress. Among the antioxidants tested, N-acetyl cysteine and glutathione, which are not only ROS scavengers but also thiol-reducing agents, mimicked the protective effects of NE. Consistently, Kelch-like ECH-associating protein 1 inhibitors, which activated the Nrf2 pathway, failed to decrease Abeta1-42-induced ROS generation and elicited no protection against Abeta1-42. Taken together, these findings suggest that NE could exert neuroprotective function against Abeta1-42 via redox cycling and reduction of intracellular oxidative stress regardless of downstream activation of the Nrf2 pathway.

24955499|t|Role of N-terminal residues in Abeta interactions with integrin receptor and cell surface.
24955499|a|beta-Amyloid (Abeta) is the primary protein component of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is believed to play a role in its pathology. To date, the mechanism of action of Abeta in AD is unclear. We and others have observed that Abeta interacts either with or in the vicinity of the alpha6 sub-unit of integrin, and believe this may be important in its interaction with neuronal cells. In this study, we used confocal microscopy and flow cytometry to explore the residue specific interactions of Abeta40 with the cell surface and the alpha6 integrin receptor sub-unit. We probed the importance of the RHD sequence in Abeta40 and found that removal of the residues or their mutation using the Abeta8-40 or the D7N early onset AD sequence, respectively, led to a greater interaction between Abeta40 and an antibody bound to the alpha6-integrin sub-unit, as measured by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). These results suggest that the RHD sequence of Abeta40 does not mediate Abeta-alpha6 integrin interactions. However, the cyclic RGD mimicking peptide, Cilengitide, reduced the measured interaction between Abeta40 fibrils without the RHD sequence and an antibody bound to the alpha6-integrin sub-unit. We further probed the role of electrostatic forces on Abeta40-cell interactions and observed that the Abeta sequence that included the N-terminal segment of the peptide had reduced cellular binding at low salt concentrations, suggesting that its first 7 residues contribute to an electrostatic repulsion for the cell surface. These findings contribute to our understanding of Abeta-cell surface interactions and may provide insight into development of novel strategies to block Abeta-cell interactions that contribute to pathology in Alzheimer's disease.

24956443|t|The involvement of sigma1 receptors in donepezil-induced rescue of hippocampal LTP impaired by beta-amyloid peptide.
24956443|a|Donepezil is a potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Additional therapeutically relevant target for donepezil is sigma1 receptor (Sig1-R). Beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) is believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. In our previous work (Kapai et al., 2012), we have shown that donepezil antagonizes the suppressive action of Abeta(1-42) on long-term potentiation (LTP) in rat hippocampal slices. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether Sig1-R is involved into the mechanisms of donepezil action. For this purpose, we have tested whether agonist of Sig1-R PRE-084 mimics, and antagonist of Sig1-R haloperidol abolishes the effect of donepezil. Population spikes (PSs) were recorded from the pyramidal layer of the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices. Drugs were applied by addition to the perfusate starting 15 min before and ending 5 min after the tetanus. In the control group, the amplitude of PS 30 min post-tetanus reached 153+-10%. Abeta (200 nM) markedly suppressed the LTP magnitude or even caused the suppression of baseline PS (82+-8%, P<0.001). This suppression of LTP could be markedly prevented when 1 muM donepezil was co-administered with Abeta (136+-11%, P<0.05). Further, we co-administered three substances: Abeta, donepezil and 0.5 muM haloperidol and have found that haloperidol antagonized the stimulating effect of donepezil on LTP (92+-6%, P<0.05). Agonist of Sig1-R PRE-084 (0.1-10 muM) enhanced control LTP and abolished the inhibitory effect of Abeta on LTP in a concentration-dependent manner. The amplitude of PS 30 min post-tetanus reached 183+-7% (P<0.01) for 10 muM PRE-084. The results suggest that activation of Sig1-R is involved into the mechanisms of donepezil-induced rescue of hippocampal LTP impaired by Abeta.

24957018|t|Cocoa extracts reduce oligomerization of amyloid-beta: implications for cognitive improvement in Alzheimer's disease.
24957018|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by pathological aggregates of amyloid peptide-beta (Abeta) and tau protein. Currently available therapies mediate AD symptoms without modifying disease progression. Polyphenol-rich diets are reported to reduce the risk for AD. OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we investigated the AD disease-modifying effects of cocoa, a rich source of flavanols, which are a class of polyphenols. We hypothesized that cocoa extracts interfere with amyloid-beta oligomerization to prevent synaptic deficits. METHODS: We tested the effects of three different cocoa extracts, viz. Natural, Dutched, and Lavado extracts, on Abeta42 and Abeta40 oligomerization, using photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins technique. To assess the effects of cocoa extracts on synaptic function, we measured long term potentiation in mouse brain hippocampal slices exposed to oligomeric Abeta. RESULTS: Our results indicate that cocoa extracts are effective in preventing the oligomerization of Abeta, with Lavado extract being most effective. Lavado extract, but not Dutched extract, was effective in restoring the long term potentiation response reduced by oligomeric Abeta. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that cocoa extracts have multiple disease-modifying properties in AD and present a promising route of therapeutic and/or preventative initiatives.

24961795|t|Amyloid precursor protein and neural development.
24961795|a|Interest in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) has increased in recent years due to its involvement in Alzheimer's disease. Since its molecular cloning, significant genetic and biochemical work has focused on the role of APP in the pathogenesis of this disease. Thus far, however, these studies have failed to deliver successful therapies. This suggests that understanding the basic biology of APP and its physiological role during development might be a crucial missing link for a better comprehension of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we present an overview of some of the key studies performed in various model organisms that have revealed roles for APP at different stages of neuronal development.

24961930|t|Modulation of amyloid-beta aggregation by histidine-coordinating Cobalt(III) Schiff base complexes.
24961930|a|Oligomers of the Abeta42 peptide are significant neurotoxins linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Histidine (His) residues present at the N terminus of Abeta42 are believed to influence toxicity by either serving as metal-ion binding sites (which promote oligomerization and oxidative damage) or facilitating synaptic binding. Transition metal complexes that bind to these residues and modulate Abeta toxicity have emerged as therapeutic candidates. Cobalt(III) Schiff base complexes (Co-sb) were evaluated for their ability to interact with Abeta peptides. HPLC-MS, NMR, fluorescence, and DFT studies demonstrated that Co-sb complexes could interact with the His residues in a truncated Abeta16 peptide representing the Abeta42 N terminus. Coordination of Co-sb complexes altered the structure of Abeta42 peptides and promoted the formation of large soluble oligomers. Interestingly, this structural perturbation of Abeta correlated to reduced synaptic binding to hippocampal neurons. These results demonstrate the promise of Co-sb complexes in anti-AD therapeutic approaches.

24961945|t|High manganese, a risk for Alzheimer's disease: high manganese induces amyloid-beta related cognitive impairment.
24961945|a|Excess manganese (Mn) in brain can be neurotoxic, implicated in several neurodegenerative disorders such as sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, little is known about the altered metal environment including elevated Mn in the progressive cognitive impairment of AD. Indeed, whether high Mn is associated with AD risk remains elusive. In the study, we recruited 40 Chinese elders with different cognitive statuses and investigated concentrations of Mn in whole blood and plasma amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides. Surprisingly, there were significant correlations of Mn with Mini-Mental State Examination score and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale score. In addition, plasma Abeta peptides increased with elevated Mn. Further studies both in vitro and in vivo demonstrated dose-related neurotoxicity and increase of Abeta by Mn treatment, which was probably caused by disrupted Abeta degradation. These data suggested that high Mn may be involved in the progress of AD as an essential pathogenic factor.

24962758|t|Abeta-HBc virus-like particles immunization without additional adjuvant ameliorates the learning and memory and reduces Abeta deposit in PDAPP mice.
24962758|a|beta-Amyloid peptide (Abeta) immunization is regarded as a promising therapy to Alzheimer's disease. The full length Abeta as antigen might induce meningoencephalitis adverse effect since the middle and C-terminal fragments of Abeta contain T cell epitopes. While N-terminal fragment of Abeta, containing B cell epitope, has weak or no immunogenicity. To improve the immunogenicity, in the previous study, we used HBv core antigen as carrier to make fusion protein containing 2 Abeta1-15. The fusion protein could form virus-like particles (VLPs) and had strong immunogenicity. The antisera prevented Abeta fiber formation and protected the PC12 cells against toxicity of Abeta. In the present study, we immunized 12-month old AD transgenic mice, PDAPP mice, to observe the therapeutic effect of immunization on behaviour and pathology. During immunization, the titer of anti-Abeta antibody reached to nearly 1:10(6) after 4th inoculation, and then maintained that level to the end of the experiment. After 6-month immunization, the behavioral changes of mice were tested by Morris Water Maze (MWM). The escape latency of immunized mice was shorter than control, and these mice entered platform quadrant more times. Immunohistochemistry results showed that Abeta-HBc VLPs immunized mice had less amyloid deposit with less microglia in cortex and hippocampus. In conclusion, Abeta-HBc VLPs ameliorated the learning and memory and reduced cerebral Abeta deposit in PDAPP mice.

24966375|t|RAGE inhibition in microglia prevents ischemia-dependent synaptic dysfunction in an amyloid-enriched environment.
24966375|a|Ischemia is known to increase the deleterious effect of beta-amyloid (Abeta), contributing to early cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we investigated whether transient ischemia may function as a trigger for Abeta-dependent synaptic impairment in the entorhinal cortex (EC), acting through specific cellular signaling. We found that synaptic depression induced by oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) was enhanced in EC slices either in presence of synthetic oligomeric Abeta or in slices from mutant human amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice (mhAPP J20). OGD-induced synaptic depression was ameliorated by functional suppression of RAGE. In particular, overexpression of the dominant-negative form of RAGE targeted to microglia (DNMSR) protects against OGD-induced synaptic impairment in an amyloid-enriched environment, reducing the activation of stress-related kinases (p38MAPK and JNK) and the release of IL-1beta. Our results demonstrate a prominent role for the RAGE-dependent neuroinflammatory pathway in the synaptic failure induced by Abeta and triggered by transient ischemia.

24966384|t|Ear2 deletion causes early memory and learning deficits in APP/PS1 mice.
24966384|a|To assess the consequences of locus ceruleus (LC) degeneration and subsequent noradrenaline (NA) deficiency in early Alzheimer's disease (AD), mice overexpressing mutant amyloid precursor protein and presenilin-1 (APP/PS1) were crossed with Ear2(-/-) mice that have a severe loss of LC neurons projecting to the hippocampus and neocortex. Testing spatial memory and hippocampal long-term potentiation revealed an impairment in APP/PS1 Ear2(-/-) mice, whereas APP/PS1 or Ear2(-/-) mice showed only minor changes. These deficits were associated with distinct synaptic changes including reduced expression of the NMDA 2A subunit and increased levels of NMDA receptor 2B in APP/PS1 Ear2(-/-) mice. Acute pharmacological replacement of NA by L-threo-DOPS partially restored phosphorylation of beta-CaMKII and spatial memory performance in APP/PS1 Ear2(-/-) mice. These changes were not accompanied by altered APP processing or amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) deposition. Thus, early LC degeneration and subsequent NA reduction may contribute to cognitive deficits via CaMKII and NMDA receptor dysfunction independent of Abeta and suggests that NA supplementation could be beneficial in treating AD.

24966406|t|Traumatic brain injury and risk of dementia in older veterans.
24966406|a|OBJECTIVES: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is common in military personnel, and there is growing concern about the long-term effects of TBI on the brain; however, few studies have examined the association between TBI and risk of dementia in veterans. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 188,764 US veterans aged 55 years or older who had at least one inpatient or outpatient visit during both the baseline (2000-2003) and follow-up (2003-2012) periods and did not have a dementia diagnosis at baseline. TBI and dementia diagnoses were determined using ICD-9 codes in electronic medical records. Fine-Gray proportional hazards models were used to determine whether TBI was associated with greater risk of incident dementia, accounting for the competing risk of death and adjusting for demographics, medical comorbidities, and psychiatric disorders. RESULTS: Veterans were a mean age of 68 years at baseline. During the 9-year follow-up period, 16% of those with TBI developed dementia compared with 10% of those without TBI (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.57; 95% confidence interval: 1.35-1.83). There was evidence of an additive association between TBI and other conditions on risk of dementia. CONCLUSIONS: TBI in older veterans was associated with a 60% increase in the risk of developing dementia over 9 years after accounting for competing risks and potential confounders. Our results suggest that TBI in older veterans may predispose toward development of symptomatic dementia and raise concern about the potential long-term consequences of TBI in younger veterans and civilians.

24967961|t|Abeta1-42 reduces P-glycoprotein in the blood-brain barrier through RAGE-NF-kappaB signaling.
24967961|a|The reduced clearance of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) from the brain partly accounts for the neurotoxic accumulation of Abeta in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, it has been suggested that P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which is an efflux transporter expressed on the luminal membrane of the brain capillary endothelium, is capable of transporting Abeta out of the brain. Although evidence has shown that restoring P-gp reduces brain Abeta in a mouse model of AD, the molecular mechanisms underlying the decrease in P-gp expression in AD is largely unknown. We found that Abeta1-42 reduced P-gp expression in the murine brain endothelial cell line bEnd.3, which was consistent with our in vivo data that P-gp expression was significantly reduced, especially near amyloid plaques in the brains of five familial AD mutations (5XFAD) mice that are used as an animal model for AD. A neutralizing antibody against the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and an inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling prevented the decrease in Abeta1-42-induced P-gp expression, suggesting that Abeta reduced P-gp expression through NF-kappaB signaling by interacting with RAGE. In addition, we observed that the P-gp reduction by Abeta was rescued in bEnd.3 cells receiving inductive signals or factors from astrocytes making contacts with endothelial cells (ECs). These results support that alterations of astrocyte-EC contacts were closely associated with P-gp expression. This suggestion was further supported by the observation of a loss of astrocyte polarity in the brains of 5XFAD mice. Taken together, we found that P-gp downregulation by Abeta was mediated through RAGE-NF-kappaB signaling pathway in ECs and that the contact between astrocytes and ECs was an important factor in the regulation of P-gp expression.

24968097|t|Curcumin derivatives as metal-chelating agents with potential multifunctional activity for pharmaceutical applications.
24968097|a|Curcuminoids represent new perspectives for the development of novel therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease (AD), one probable mechanism of action is related to their metal complexing ability. In this work we examined the metal complexing ability of substituted curcuminoids to propose new chelating molecules with biological properties comparable with curcumin but with improved stability as new potential AD therapeutic agents. The K2T derivatives originate from the insertion of a -CH2COOC(CH3)3 group on the central atom of the diketonic moiety of curcumin. They retain the diketo-ketoenol tautomerism which is solvent dependent. In aqueous solution the prevalent form is the diketo one but the addition of metal ion (Ga(3+), Cu(2+)) causes the dissociation of the enolic proton creating chelate complexes and shifting the tautomeric equilibrium towards the keto-enol form. The formation of metal complexes is followed by both NMR and UV-vis spectroscopy. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations on K2T21 complexes with Ga(3+) and Cu(2+) are performed and compared with those on curcumin complexes. [Ga(K2T21)2(H2O)2](+) was found more stable than curcumin one. Good agreement is detected between calculated and experimental (1)H and (13)C NMR data. The calculated OH bond dissociation energy (BDE) and the OH proton dissociation enthalpy (PDE), allowed to predict the radical scavenging ability of the metal ion complexed with K2T21, while the calculated electronic affinity (EA) and ionization potential (IP) represent yardsticks of antioxidant properties. Eventually theoretical calculations suggest that the proton-transfer-associated superoxide-scavenging activity is enhanced after binding metal ions, and that Ga(3+) complexes display possible superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like activity.

24969443|t|Autobiographical narratives relate to Alzheimer's disease biomarkers in older adults.
24969443|a|BACKGROUND: Autobiographical memory (ABM), personal semantic memory (PSM), and autonoetic consciousness are affected in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) but their relationship with Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers are unclear. METHODS: Forty-five participants (healthy controls (HC) = 31, MCI = 14) completed the Episodic ABM Interview and a battery of memory tests. Thirty-one (HC = 22, MCI = 9) underwent beta-amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Fourteen participants (HC = 9, MCI = 5) underwent one imaging modality. RESULTS: Unlike PSM, ABM differentiated between diagnostic categories but did not relate to AD biomarkers. Personal semantic memory was related to neocortical beta-amyloid burden after adjusting for age and apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4. Autonoetic consciousness was not associated with AD biomarkers, and was not impaired in MCI. CONCLUSIONS: Autobiographical memory was impaired in MCI participants but was not related to neocortical amyloid burden, suggesting that personal memory systems are impacted by differing disease mechanisms, rather than being uniformly underpinned by beta-amyloid. Episodic and semantic ABM impairment represent an important AD prodrome.

24970022|t|Attenuated ability of BACE1 to cleave the amyloid precursor protein via silencing long noncoding RNA BACE1-AS expression.
24970022|a|Although large numbers of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) expressed in the mammalian nervous system have been detected, their functions and mechanisms of regulation remain to be fully clarified. It has been reported that the lncRNA antisense transcript for beta-secretase-1 (BACE1-AS) is elevated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and drives the rapid feed-forward regulation of beta-secretase, suggesting that it is critical in AD development. In the present study, the senile plaque (SP) AD SH-SY5Y cell model was established using the synthetic amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) 1-42 in vitro. Using this model, the potential of siRNA-mediated silencing of lncRNA BACE1-AS expression to attenuate the ability of beta-secretase-1 (BACE1) to cleave amyloid precursor protein (APP) and to reduce the production of Abeta1-42 oligomers was investigated. MTT assays demonstrated that exogenous Abeta1-42 suppressed SH-SY5Y cell proliferation and induced APP-related factor expression and SP formation. Furthermore, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis revealed that the mRNA and protein expression of Abeta1-42 and Abeta1-40 was significantly increased in the AD model group, with a marked decrease in Ki-67 expression at day six. RNase protection assays (RPA) and northern blotting analysis confirmed that exogenous Abeta1-42 not only promoted the expression of the APP-cleaving enzyme BACE1, but also induced lncRNA BACE1-AS expression. Furthermore, lncRNA BACE1-AS formed RNA duplexes and increased the stability of BACE1 mRNA. Downregulation of lncRNA BACE1-AS expression in SH-SY5Y cells by siRNA silencing resulted in the attenuation of the ability of BACE1 to cleave APP and delayed the induction of SP formation in the SP AD SH-SY5Y cell model.

24970906|t|Abeta imaging with 18F-florbetaben in prodromal Alzheimer's disease: a prospective outcome study.
24970906|a|BACKGROUND: We assessed the clinical utility of beta-amyloid (Abeta) imaging with (18)F-florbetaben (FBB) in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) by evaluating its prognostic accuracy for progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD), comparing semiquantitative with visual scan assessment, and exploring the relationships among Abeta, hippocampal volume (HV) and memory over time. METHODS: 45 MCI underwent FBB positron emission tomography, MRI and neuropsychological assessment at baseline and 2 years and clinical follow-up at 4 years. Positive FBB (FBB+), defined by a cortical to cerebellar cortex standardised uptake value ratio (SUVR) >= 1.45, was compared with visual assessment by five readers. Amnestic MCI (aMCI) was defined by a composite episodic memory (EM) Z-score of <-1.5. RESULTS: At baseline, 24 (53%) MCI were FBB+. Majority reads agreed with SUVR classification (kappa 0.96). In 2 years, 18 (75%) FBB+ progressed to AD compared with 2 (9.5%) FBB-, yielding a predictive accuracy of 83% (95% CI 61% to 94%). Four FBB- developed non-AD dementia. Predictive accuracies of HV (58% (95% CI 42% to 73%)) and aMCI status (73% (95% CI 58% to 81%)) were lower. Combinations did not improve accuracy. By 4 years, 21 (87.5%) FBB+ had AD whereas 5 (24%) FBB- had non-AD dementia yielding a predictive accuracy of 94% (95% CI 74% to 99%). While the strong baseline association between FBB SUVR and EM declined over 2 years, the association between EM and HV became stronger. FBB SUVR increased 2.2%/year in FBB+ with no change in FBB-. CONCLUSIONS: (18)F-florbetaben Abeta imaging facilitates accurate detection of prodromal AD. As neurodegeneration progresses, and in contrast with the early stages of the disease, hippocampal atrophy and not Abeta, seems to drive memory decline. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01138111.

24972123|t|The impact of patient age and comorbidities on the occurrence of "never events" in cerebrovascular surgery: an analysis of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample.
24972123|a|OBJECT: As health care administrators focus on patient safety and cost-effectiveness, methodical assessment of quality outcome measures is critical. In 2008 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) published a series of "never events" that included 11 hospital-acquired conditions (HACs) for which related costs of treatment are not reimbursed. Cerebrovascular procedures (CVPs) are complex and are often performed in patients with significant medical comorbidities. METHODS: This study examines the impact of patient age and medical comorbidities on the occurrence of CMS-defined HACs, as well as the effect of these factors on the length of stay (LOS) and hospitalization charges in patients undergoing common CVPs. RESULTS: The HACs occurred at a frequency of 0.49% (1.33% in the intracranial procedures and 0.33% in the carotid procedures). Falls/trauma (n = 4610, 72.3% HACs, 357 HACs per 100,000 CVPs) and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (n = 714, 11.2% HACs, 55 HACs per 100,000 CVPs) were the most common events. Age and the presence of >= 2 comorbidities were strong independent predictors of HACs (p < 0.0001). The occurrence of HACs negatively impacts both LOS and hospital costs. Patients with at least 1 HAC were 10 times more likely to have prolonged LOS (>= 90th percentile) (p < 0.0001), and 8 times more likely to have high inpatient costs (>= 90th percentile) (p < 0.0001) when adjusting for patient and hospital factors. CONCLUSIONS: Improved quality protocols focused on individual patient characteristics might help to decrease the frequency of HACs in this high-risk population. These data suggest that risk adjustment according to underlying patient factors may be warranted when considering reimbursement for costs related to HACs in the setting of CVPs.

24973120|t|Resting microglia react to Abeta42 fibrils but do not detect oligomers or oligomer-induced neuronal damage.
24973120|a|In Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposits accumulate in the brain parenchyma and contain fibrils of aggregated heterogeneous Abeta peptides. In addition to fibrils, Abeta aggregates into stable soluble species (termed Abeta oligomers), which are increasingly viewed as the key drivers of early neurodegenerative events in AD. Abeta aggregates stimulate microglia recruitment and activation. In the AD brain, microglia surround Abeta deposits, activate, and abnormally produce inflammatory mediators, contributing to AD pathogenesis. However, it remains unclear to which of the conformationally diverse Abeta species microglia specifically react. Here, we explore the "sensor" capability of murine microglia. We examine whether they can detect and discriminate the toxic Abeta oligomers, Abeta fibrils, and Abeta-induced neuronal damage and investigate whether they are activated by diverse human Abeta species cell autonomously or through neuron-derived factors. We find that, on aggregation in vitro, Abeta42 peptides form stable oligomers and fibrils, which are neurotoxic and trigger dendritic spine loss in mature primary mouse hippocampal neurons. Further, in resting primary murine microglia, Abeta42 fibrils induce a pattern of expression of inflammatory genes typical of the classical inflammatory response induced by infectious agents (e.g., the bacterial toxin lipopolysaccharide). Conversely, Abeta42 oligomers never elicit a microglia inflammatory response, whether applied alone, in combination with neuron-derived secreted factors, or in contact with neurons. Thus, microglia strongly react to Abeta42 fibrils, but do not sense Abeta oligomers or oligomer-induced neuronal damage. This suggests that early neurotoxic species can escape detection by microglia, leading to the chronic unfolding of amyloid pathology in AD.

24973121|t|Zileuton restores memory impairments and reverses amyloid and tau pathology in aged Alzheimer's disease mice.
24973121|a|The enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (5LO) is upregulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and its pharmacologic blockade with zileuton slows down the development of the AD-like phenotype in young AD mice. However, its efficacy after the AD pathology is established is unknown. To this end, starting at 12 months of age triple transgenic mice (3xTg) received zileuton, a selective 5LO inhibitor, or placebo for 3 months, and then the effect of this treatment on behavior, amyloid, and tau pathology assessed. Although mice on placebo showed worsening of their memory, treated mice performed even better than at baseline. Compared with placebo, treated mice had significantly less Abeta deposits and tau phosphorylation secondary to reduced gamma-secretase and CDK-5 activation, respectively. Our data provide novel insights into the disease-modifying action of pharmacologically inhibiting 5LO as a viable AD therapeutic approach. They represent the successful completion of preclinical studies for the development of this class of drug as clinically applicable therapy for the disease.

24973554|t|Copper(II), nickel(II) and zinc(II) complexes of the N-terminal nonapeptide fragment of amyloid-beta and its derivatives.
24973554|a|Copper(II), nickel(II) and zinc(II) complexes of the nonapeptide fragment of amyloid-beta Abeta(1-9) (NH2-DAEFRHDSG-NH2) and its two derivatives: NH2-DAAAAHAAA-NH2 and NH2-DAAAAAHAA-NH2 have been studied by potentiometric, UV-visible and CD spectroscopic methods. The results reveal the primary role of the amino terminus of peptides in copper(II) and nickel(II) binding. The formation of dinuclear complexes was also possible in the copper(II) containing systems but only the first six amino acids from the amino terminus were involved in metal binding in the physiologically relevant pH range. The coordination chemistry of the two alanine mutated peptides is almost the same as that of the native nonapeptide, but the thermodynamic stability of the copper(II) complexes of the mutants is significantly reduced. This difference probably comes from the secondary interactions of the polar side chains of Asp, Glu, Ser and Arg residues present in the native peptide. Moreover, this difference reveals that the amino acid sequence of the N-terminal domains of amyloid peptides is especially well suited for the complexation with copper(II) ions.

24973918|t|GABA from reactive astrocytes impairs memory in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.
24973918|a|In Alzheimer's disease (AD), memory impairment is the most prominent feature that afflicts patients and their families. Although reactive astrocytes have been observed around amyloid plaques since the disease was first described, their role in memory impairment has been poorly understood. Here, we show that reactive astrocytes aberrantly and abundantly produce the inhibitory gliotransmitter GABA by monoamine oxidase-B (Maob) and abnormally release GABA through the bestrophin 1 channel. In the dentate gyrus of mouse models of AD, the released GABA reduces spike probability of granule cells by acting on presynaptic GABA receptors. Suppressing GABA production or release from reactive astrocytes fully restores the impaired spike probability, synaptic plasticity, and learning and memory in the mice. In the postmortem brain of individuals with AD, astrocytic GABA and MAOB are significantly upregulated. We propose that selective inhibition of astrocytic GABA synthesis or release may serve as an effective therapeutic strategy for treating memory impairment in AD.

24975041|t|Transformation of beta-sheet structures of the amyloid peptide induced by molecular modulators.
24975041|a|In this work we report the effect of terminus molecular modulators on the secondary structures of the amyloid peptide aggregates. The controlled modulation of the assembly structure and the transformation of beta-sheet secondary structures could be beneficial for gaining insight into the aggregation mechanism of peptides. Particularly, multiple assembling characteristics have been identified as a reflection of peptide-organic interactions. 

24975095|t|Tetramethylpyrazine, a natural alkaloid, attenuates pro-inflammatory mediators induced by amyloid beta and interferon-gamma in rat brain microglia.
24975095|a|Neuroinflammation has been consistently reported as a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer s disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. Microglial cells are activated by diverse pathological stimuli and play key roles in development of neuroinflammation. Amyloid beta peptide (Abeta), the major constituent of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer s brain, is known to activate cultured microglial cells to produce increased amounts of proinflammatory and neurotoxic factors. Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) is the main bioactive alkaloid isolated from Ligusticum chuanxiong. TMP has multiple pharmacological activities, including anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer effects. Neuroprotective potential of TMP has been demonstrated in animal models of neuropathologies. However, the efficacy of this compound for controlling Abeta-related neuropathology has not been explored yet. We examined the efficacy of TMP in the repression of inflammatory response in cultured microglial cells stimulated with Abeta25-35 in the presence of interferon (IFN)-gamma. TMP significantly inhibited the Abeta25-35 and IFN-gamma-stimulated productions of nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and intracellular reactive oxygen species from primary microglial cells. TMP also effectively reduced Abeta25-35 and IFN-gamma-elicited NF-kappaB activation. In organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSCs), TMP significantly blocked Abeta25-35-induced reactive oxygen species generation and phosphorylation of Akt. Furthermore, TMP also inhibited Abeta1-42-induced TNF-alpha and IL-1beta production in primary microglial cells and neuronal death in OHSCs. These results suggest that TMP provide a possible therapeutic approach for alleviating the inflammatory progression of Alzheimer s disease.

24975829|t|Notoginsenoside R1 attenuates amyloid-beta-induced damage in neurons by inhibiting reactive oxygen species and modulating MAPK activation.
24975829|a|Progressive accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta increases free radical production in neuronal cells, leading to oxidative stress and cell death. An intervention that would reduce Abeta-related neurotoxicity through free radical reduction could advance the treatment of AD. Notoginsenoside R1 (NR1), the major and most active ingredient in the herb Panax notoginseng, can reduce reactive oxygen species and confer some neuroprotective effects. Here, NR1 was applied in a cell-based model of Alzheimer's disease. Cell viability, cell death, reactive oxygen species generation, and mitochondrial membrane potential were assessed in cultured PC12 neuronal cells incubated with Abeta(25-35). In this model, Abeta was neurotoxic and induced necrosis and apoptosis; however, NR1 significantly counteracted the effects of Abeta by increasing cell viability, reducing oxidative damage (including apoptosis), restoring mitochondrial membrane potential, and suppressing stress-activated MAPK signaling pathways. These results promise a great potential agent for Alzheimer's disease and other Abeta pathology-related neuronal degenerative disease.

24976018|t|Red blood cells serve as intravascular carriers of myeloperoxidase.
24976018|a|Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a heme enzyme abundantly expressed in polymorphonuclear neutrophils. MPO is enzymatically capable of catalyzing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the consumption of nitric oxide (NO). Thus MPO has both potent microbicidal and, upon binding to the vessel wall, pro-inflammatory properties. Interestingly, MPO - a highly cationic protein - has been shown to bind to both endothelial cells and leukocyte membranes. Given the anionic surface charge of red blood cells, we investigated binding of MPO to erythrocytes. Red blood cells (RBCs) derived from patients with elevated MPO plasma levels showed significantly higher amounts of MPO by flow cytometry and ELISA than healthy controls. Heparin-induced MPO-release from patient-derived RBCs was significantly increased compared to controls. Ex vivo experiments revealed dose and time dependency for MPO-RBC binding, and immunofluorescence staining as well as confocal microscopy localized MPO-RBC interaction to the erythrocyte plasma membrane. NO-consumption by RBC-membrane fragments (erythrocyte "ghosts") increased with incrementally greater concentrations of MPO during incubation, indicating preserved catalytic MPO activity. In vivo infusion of MPO-loaded RBCs into C57BL/6J mice increased local MPO tissue concentrations in liver, spleen, lung, and heart tissue as well as within the cardiac vasculature. Further, NO-dependent relaxation of aortic rings was altered by RBC bound-MPO and systemic vascular resistance significantly increased after infusion of MPO-loaded RBCs into mice. In summary, we find that MPO binds to RBC membranes in vitro and in vivo, is transported by RBCs to remote sites in mice, and affects endothelial function as well as systemic vascular resistance. RBCs may avidly bind circulating MPO, and act as carriers of this leukocyte-derived enzyme.

24977484|t|PS dependent APP cleavage regulates glucosylceramide synthase and is affected in Alzheimer's disease.
24977484|a|BACKGROUND: Gangliosides were found to be associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we addressed a potential function of gamma-secretase (presenilin) dependent cleavage of the amyloid-precursor-protein (APP) in the regulation of ganglioside de novo synthesis. METHODS: To identify a potential role of gamma-secretase and APP in ganglioside de novo synthesis we used presenilin (PS) deficient and APP deficient cells and mouse brains, mutated PS as well as transgenic mice and AD post mortem brains. Changes in glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) activity were identified by incorporation of radiolabeled UDP-glucose in glucosylceramide, changes in gene expression via real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. Alterations in ganglioside levels were determined by thin layer chromatography and mass spectrometry. RESULTS: We found that PS and APP deficiency, in vitro and in vivo, resulted in increased GCS gene expression, elevated enzyme activity and thus increased glucosylceramide and total ganglioside level. Using a specific gamma-secretase inhibitor revealed that PS proteolytic activity alters ganglioside homeostasis. By the use of mutated PS causing early onset AD in cell culture and transgenic mice we found that GCS is increased in AD, further substantiated by the use of AD post mortem brains, suffering from sporadic AD. CONCLUSION: APP processing regulates ganglioside de novo synthesis and is affected in AD.

24977637|t|The role of hippocampal tau protein phosphorylation in isoflurane-induced cognitive dysfunction in transgenic APP695 mice.
24977637|a|BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that exposure to inhaled anesthetics can cause cognitive dysfunction, suggesting that general anesthesia might be a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer disease. However, the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In the present study, we tested our hypothesis that enhanced tau protein phosphorylation in hippocampus contributes to isoflurane-induced cognitive dysfunction in a mouse model of Alzheimer disease. METHODS: Fifty-four male wild-type (WT) mice (12 months old) and 54 male amyloid precursor protein 695 (APP695) mice (12 months old) were either anesthetized for 4 hours with 1.0 minimum alveolar concentration isoflurane or sham-anesthetized (control). Learning and memory behaviors were measured using the Morris Water Maze test for mice. Phosphorylation of hippocampal tau protein at Ser262 site was analyzed with quantitative Western blotting. RESULTS: In the Morris Water Maze test, both WT and transgenic APP695 mice showed decreased latency times during a 4-day training period. Isoflurane exposure significantly increased the latency times on days 2 and 3 in WT mice as well as on days 3 and 4 in APP695 mice (WT: P = 0.005 for day 2 and P = 0.002 for day 3; APP695: P = 0.001 for day 3 and P < 0.0001 for day 4) and reduced platform quadrant times (WT: P < 0.0001; APP695: P < 0.0001) in both types of mice. Compared with WT mice, transgenic APP695 mice displayed worse learning and memory behaviors after isoflurane exposure (P = 0.0005 for escape latency testing on day 4 training; P = 0.009 for platform probe testing). Western blot analysis showed that the levels of phosphorylation of hippocampal tau protein at Ser262 site (tau[pS262]) in the transgenic APP695 mice were higher than those in WT mice (P < 0.0001) and that isoflurane exposure time dependently enhanced the hippocampal tau[pS262] levels in both types of mice, but this effect was much more significant in the transgenic APP695 mice (P < 0.0001). Our data also showed that isoflurane exposure had no effect on the expression of total tau protein in the hippocampi of all mice (P >= 0.54). CONCLUSIONS: Isoflurane may induce cognitive dysfunction by enhancing phosphorylation of hippocampal tau protein at Ser262 site, and this effect is more significant in transgenic APP695 mice.

24977973|t|Insulin inhibits Abeta production through modulation of APP processing in a cellular model of Alzheimer's disease.
24977973|a|OBJECTIVE: Amyloid-beta (Abeta) is a 36-43 amino acid peptide that is derived by processing of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP). Abeta plays a central role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although growing evidence suggests that insulin has important functions in Abeta metabolism, the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. METHODS: Using an SH-SY5Y cell line overexpressing human APP Swedish mutant (APPsw), we evaluated the effect of insulin on APP processing and Abeta production by using western blot analysist. RESULTS: Our data showed that administration of insulin reduced the Abeta generation in culture media with a concomitant decreases in the levels of beta-secretase BACE1, secreted extracellular domain (sAPPbeta) and a fragment of 99 amino acids (C99) in APPsw cells. We further showed that insulin increased the levels of alpha-secretase ADAM10, a secreted extracellular domain secreted (sAPPa) and a fragment of 83 amino acids (C83) in APPsw cells. CONCLUSION: Our present data suggest that insulin could inhibit Abeta production through modulation of APP processing by increasing cleavage at the a-secretase site and decreased cleavage at the beta-secretase sites.

24978100|t|Effects of polyamino acids and polyelectrolytes on amyloid beta fibril formation.
24978100|a|The fibril formation of the neurodegenerative peptide amyloid beta (Abeta42) is sensitive to solution conditions, and several proteins and peptides have been found to retard the process. Abeta42 fibril formation was followed with ThT fluorescence in the presence of polyamino acids (poly-glutamic acid, poly-lysine, and poly-threonine) and other polymers (poly(acrylic acid), poly(ethylenimine), and poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride). An accelerating effect on the Abeta42 aggregation process is observed from all positively charged polymers, while no effect is seen from the negative or neutral polymers. The accelerating effect is dependent on the concentration of positive polymer in a highly reproducible manner. Acceleration is observed from a 1:500 polymer to Abeta42 weight ratio and up. Polyamino acids and the other polymers exert quantitatively the same effect at the same concentrations based on weight. Fibrils are formed in all cases as verified by transmission electron microscopy. The concentrations of polymers required for acceleration are too low to affect the Abeta42 aggregation process through increased ionic strength or molecular crowding effects. Instead, the acceleration seems to arise from the locally increased Abeta42 concentration near the polymers, which favors association and affects the electrostatic environment of the peptide.

24979265|t|Evaluation of selective positron emission tomography template method for spatial normalization of amyloid imaging with 11C-Pittsburgh Compound B.
24979265|a|OBJECTIVE: Spatial normalization of C-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) images is challenging for an automatic quantitative analysis without magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) because of different distribution patterns between amyloid positive and negative images. To overcome this issue, we evaluated a selective positron emission tomography template (SPT) method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three sets of single positron emission tomography templates were created: PiB negative template, PiB positive template, and mixed template. Sixty-one patients with dementia were enrolled as the validation cohort. Magnetic resonance imaging-aided normalization method was used as a reference. The SPT method was based on visual classification (positive, negative, and equivocal). The optimal templates for each visual group were determined by correlation values and average percent errors (APEs) with MRI-aided normalization. The results of the SPT and the single template methods were compared with those of MRI-aided normalization in terms of correlation values, APEs, and concordance rates. RESULTS: The SPT (PiB negative template for the negative and equivocal groups and PiB positive template for the positive group) showed higher correlations and concordance rate and lower APEs with MRI-aided normalization than did the single template. CONCLUSIONS: Use of the SPT provides accurate normalization of amyloid images without MRI.

24981190|t|Amyloid-directed monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease: the point of no return?
24981190|a|INTRODUCTION: Two humanized monoclonal antibodies, bapineuzumab and solanezumab, directed against the N terminus and mid-region of beta-amyloid (Abeta), respectively, were recently tested in large, long-term Phase III trials in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). AREAS COVERED: This review discusses current clinical data on solanezumab, bapineuzumab and their failure in Phase III trials to show significant clinical benefits, as well as other monoclonal antibodies under investigation for AD. EXPERT OPINION: Solanezumab showed some beneficial cognitive effects in mildly affected AD patients and this subgroup of AD patients is currently being tested in another Phase III trial to this subgroup of AD patients to confirm previous encouraging observations. Two other monoclonal antibodies, gantenerumab, which preferentially binds to fibrillar Abeta, and crenezumab, which preferentially binds to soluble, oligomeric and fibrillar Abeta deposits, are being tested in secondary prevention trials in presymptomatic subjects with autosomal dominant AD mutations. Solanezumab is also being tested in a prevention study in asymptomatic older subjects, who have positive positron emission tomography scans for brain amyloid deposits. These ongoing secondary prevention trials will tell us if Abeta really plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of AD.

24982137|t|Distinct synthetic Abeta prion strains producing different amyloid deposits in bigenic mice.
24982137|a|An increasing number of studies continue to show that the amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide adopts an alternative conformation and acquires transmissibility; hence, it becomes a prion. Here, we report on the attributes of two strains of Abeta prions formed from synthetic Abeta peptides composed of either 40 or 42 residues. Modifying the conditions for Abeta polymerization increased both the protease resistance and prion infectivity compared with an earlier study. Approximately 150 d after intracerebral inoculation, both synthetic Abeta40 and Abeta42 prions produced a sustained rise in the bioluminescence imaging signal in the brains of bigenic Tg(APP23:Gfap-luc) mice, indicative of astrocytic gliosis. Pathological investigations showed that synthetic Abeta40 prions produced amyloid plaques containing both Abeta40 and Abeta42 in the brains of inoculated bigenic mice, whereas synthetic Abeta42 prions stimulated the formation of smaller, more numerous plaques composed predominantly of Abeta42. Synthetic Abeta40 preparations consisted of long straight fibrils; in contrast, the Abeta42 fibrils were much shorter. Addition of 3.47 mM (0.1%) SDS to the polymerization reaction produced Abeta42 fibrils that were indistinguishable from Abeta40 fibrils produced in the absence or presence of SDS. Moreover, the Abeta amyloid plaques in the brains of bigenic mice inoculated with Abeta42 prions prepared in the presence of SDS were similar to those found in mice that received Abeta40 prions. From these results, we conclude that the composition of Abeta plaques depends on the conformation of the inoculated Abeta polymers, and thus, these inocula represent distinct synthetic Abeta prion strains.

24982139|t|Serial propagation of distinct strains of Abeta prions from Alzheimer's disease patients.
24982139|a|An increasing number of studies argues that self-propagating protein conformations (i.e., prions) feature in the pathogenesis of several common neurodegenerative diseases. Mounting evidence contends that aggregates of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide become self-propagating in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. An important characteristic of prions is their ability to replicate distinct strains, the biological information for which is enciphered within different conformations of protein aggregates. To investigate whether distinct strains of Abeta prions can be discerned in AD patients, we performed transmission studies in susceptible transgenic mice using brain homogenates from sporadic or heritable (Arctic and Swedish) AD cases. Mice inoculated with the Arctic AD sample exhibited a pathology that could be distinguished from mice inoculated with the Swedish or sporadic AD samples, which was judged by differential accumulation of Abeta isoforms and the morphology of cerebrovascular Abeta deposition. Unlike Swedish AD- or sporadic AD-inoculated animals, Arctic AD-inoculated mice, like Arctic AD patients, displayed a prominent Abeta38-containing cerebral amyloid angiopathy. The divergent transmission behavior of the Arctic AD sample compared with the Swedish and sporadic AD samples was maintained during second passage in mice, showing that Abeta strains are serially transmissible. We conclude that at least two distinct strains of Abeta prions can be discerned in the brains of AD patients and that strain fidelity was preserved on serial passage in mice. Our results provide a potential explanation for the clinical and pathological heterogeneity observed in AD patients.

24984073|t|Amyloid beta-peptide-dependent activation of human platelets: essential role for Ca2+ and ADP in aggregation and thrombus formation.
24984073|a|Alzheimer's disease is associated with the accumulation of Abeta (amyloid beta)-peptides in the brain. Besides their cytotoxic effect on neurons, Abeta-peptides are thought to be responsible for the atherothrombotic complications associated with Alzheimer's disease, which are collectively known as cerebrovascular disease. In the present study, we investigated the effect of Abeta-peptides on human platelet signal transduction and function. We discovered that the 25-35 domain of Abeta-peptides induce an increase in platelet intracellular Ca2+ that stimulates alpha-granule and dense granule secretion and leads to the release of the secondary agonist ADP. Released ADP acts in an autocrine manner as a stimulant for critical signalling pathways leading to the activation of platelets. This includes the activation of the protein kinases Syk, protein kinase C, Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinases. Ca2+-dependent release of ADP is also the main component of the activation of the small GTPase Rap1b and the fibrinogen receptor integrin alphaIIbbeta3, which leads to increased platelet aggregation and increased thrombus formation in human whole blood. Our discoveries complement existing understanding of cerebrovascular dementia and suggest that Abeta-peptides can induce vascular complications of Alzheimer's disease by stimulating platelets in an intracellular Ca2+-dependent manner. Despite a marginal ADP-independent component suggested by low levels of signalling activity in the presence of apyrase or P2Y receptor inhibitors, Ca2+-dependent release of ADP by Abeta-peptides clearly plays a critical role in platelet activation. Targeting ADP signalling may therefore represent an important strategy to manage the cerebrovascular component of Alzheimer's disease.

24985534|t|Prevalence of dementia in urban and regional Aboriginal Australians.
24985534|a|BACKGROUND: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of dementia in collaboration with urban/regional Aboriginal communities. METHODS: A census of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men and women aged 60 years and above in the target communities identified 546 potential participants, with 336 (61.5%) participating in this cross-sectional study. Participants completed a structured interview and cognitive screening tests. One hundred fifty-three participants also completed a detailed medical assessment. Assessment data were reviewed by a panel of clinicians who determined a diagnosis of dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) according to standard criteria. RESULTS: Crude prevalence of dementia was 13.4%, and age-standardized prevalence was 21.0%. The most common types of dementia were Alzheimer's dementia (44%) and mixed dementia diagnoses (29%). Estimated prevalence of MCI was 17.7%. CONCLUSION: Consistent with previous findings in a remote population, urban and regional Aboriginal Australians face high rates of dementia at younger ages, most commonly Alzheimer's dementia.

24985705|t|Amyloid beta regulates the expression and function of AIP1.
24985705|a|Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1-interacting (ASK1-interacting) protein-1 (AIP1) is a newly identified novel member of the Ras GTPase-activating protein family, which has been implicated in cell growth inhibition and cell apoptosis. However, the effects of AIP1 in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are unknown. In the present study, we found that AIP1 was elevated in the brain of AD Tg2576 mice and Abeta1-42 treated brain cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (CECs). Abeta1-42 treatment induced the interaction of AIP1 and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), which led to dissociation of ASK1 and its inhibitor 14-3-3. Dissociation of ASK1 from 14-3-3 leads to ASK1 activation. Indeed, Abeta1-42 dephosphorylated ASK1 at Ser-967, suggesting that Abeta1-42 increased ASK1 activity. Importantly, disassociation of ASK1 and 14-3-3 induced by Abeta1-42 could be rescued by silence of AIP1. In addition, down-regulation of AIP1 also led to attenuation of the activation of JNK, as well as p53, downstream signaling targets of ASK1. AIP1 silencing attenuated the pro-apoptotic effects of Abeta1-42 on CECs. We propose that AIP1 mediates Abeta induced ASK1 activation by facilitating dissociation of 14-3-3, suggesting a novel mechanism for Abeta-induced apoptosis in CECs.

24985739|t|Maintenance of amyloid beta peptide homeostasis by artificial chaperones based on mixed-shell polymeric micelles.
24985739|a|The disruption of Abeta homeostasis, which results in the accumulation of neurotoxic amyloids, is the fundamental cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Molecular chaperones play a critical role in controlling undesired protein misfolding and maintaining intricate proteostasis in vivo. Inspired by a natural molecular chaperone, an artificial chaperone consisting of mixed-shell polymeric micelles (MSPMs) has been devised with tunable surface properties, serving as a suppressor of AD. Taking advantage of biocompatibility, selectivity toward aberrant proteins, and long blood circulation, these MSPM-based chaperones can maintain Abeta homeostasis by a combination of inhibiting Abeta fibrillation and facilitating Abeta aggregate clearance and simultaneously reducing Abeta-mediated neurotoxicity. The balance of hydrophilic/hydrophobic moieties on the surface of MSPMs is important for their enhanced therapeutic effect.

24990881|t|TREM2 mutations implicated in neurodegeneration impair cell surface transport and phagocytosis.
24990881|a|Genetic variants in the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) have been linked to Nasu-Hakola disease, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and FTD-like syndrome without bone involvement. TREM2 is an innate immune receptor preferentially expressed by microglia and is involved in inflammation and phagocytosis. Whether and how TREM2 missense mutations affect TREM2 function is unclear. We report that missense mutations associated with FTD and FTD-like syndrome reduce TREM2 maturation, abolish shedding by ADAM proteases, and impair the phagocytic activity of TREM2-expressing cells. As a consequence of reduced shedding, TREM2 is virtually absent in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma of a patient with FTD-like syndrome. A decrease in soluble TREM2 was also observed in the CSF of patients with AD and FTD, further suggesting that reduced TREM2 function may contribute to increased risk for two neurodegenerative disorders.

24990930|t|Transgenic mice overexpressing amyloid precursor protein exhibit early metabolic deficits and a pathologically low leptin state associated with hypothalamic dysfunction in arcuate neuropeptide Y neurons.
24990930|a|Weight loss is a prominent early feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that often precedes the cognitive decline and clinical diagnosis. While the exact pathogenesis of AD remains unclear, accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the brain is thought to lead to the neuronal dysfunction and death underlying the dementia. In this study, we examined whether transgenic mice overexpressing the Swedish mutation of APP (Tg2576), recapitulating selected features of AD, have hypothalamic leptin signaling dysfunction leading to early body weight deficits. We found that 3-month-old Tg2576 mice, before amyloid plaque formation, exhibit decreased weight with markedly decreased adiposity, low plasma leptin levels, and increased energy expenditure without alterations in feeding behavior. The expression of the orexigenic neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the hypothalamus to the low leptin state was abnormal at basal and fasting conditions. In addition, arcuate NPY neurons exhibited abnormal electrophysiological responses to leptin in Tg2576 hypothalamic slices or wild-type slices treated with Abeta. Finally, the metabolic deficits worsened as Tg2576 mice aged and amyloid burden increased in the brain. These results indicate that excess Abeta can potentially disrupt hypothalamic arcuate NPY neurons leading to weight loss and a pathologically low leptin state early in the disease process that progressively worsens as the amyloid burden increases. Collectively, these findings suggest that weight loss is an intrinsic pathological feature of Abeta accumulation and identify hypothalamic leptin signaling as a previously unrecognized pathogenic site of action for Abeta.

24991952|t|Alzheimer's disease genetics: from the bench to the clinic.
24991952|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a clinically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease with a strong genetic component. Several genes have been associated with AD risk for nearly 20 years. However, it was not until the recent technological advances that allow for the analysis of millions of polymorphisms in thousands of subjects that we have been able to advance our understanding of the genetic complexity of AD susceptibility. Genome-wide association studies and whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing have revealed more than 20 loci associated with AD risk. These studies have provided insights into the molecular pathways that are altered in AD pathogenesis, which have, in turn, provided insight into novel therapeutic targets.

24992945|t|Exploring Alzheimer molecular pathology in Down's syndrome cerebrospinal fluid.
24992945|a|BACKGROUND: Individuals with Down's syndrome (DS) develop early Alzheimer's disease (AD) with beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaque pathology. The extra amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene copy in DS is believed to result in a 50% increase in Abeta production, but it is unclear how this relates to the development of other AD hallmarks, including axonal degeneration and microglia cell activation, and to other neurological problems in DS, including disturbed sleep regulation. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for cerebral amyloidosis, axonal degeneration, microglial activation and sleep regulation were altered in young and old patients with DS, and if these biomarkers were related to altered Abeta and APP metabolism, reflected by CSF levels of different Abeta and APP peptides. METHODS: CSF from DS patients (n=12) and healthy controls (n=20) were analyzed for Abeta peptides (Abeta1-42, AbetaX-38/40/42), secreted APP species (sAPPalpha/beta), biomarkers for AD-like axonal degeneration [total tau (T-tau), phosphorylated tau], microglial activation (YKL-40, CC chemokine ligand 2) and orexin-A, which is a peptide involved in sleep regulation. We compared biomarker levels between groups and tested for relations between biomarkers, disease stage and age. RESULTS: Several of the markers were specifically increased in DS, including AbetaX-40, sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta. Omicronrexin-A was significantly decreased in DS and correlated with Abeta and sAPP. Orexin-A decreased with age in DS, while T-tau and YKL-40 increased with age. CONCLUSION: Down's patients have increased APP and Abeta production and increased microglial activation with age. The orexin-A metabolism is disturbed in DS and may be linked to APP and Abeta production. Biomarker studies of DS may contribute to our understanding of the amyloidogenic and neurodegenerative process in AD.

24993958|t|Cognitive functioning in relation to brain amyloid-beta in healthy adults with Down syndrome.
24993958|a|Nearly all adults with Down syndrome show neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease, including amyloid-beta deposition, by their fifth decade of life. In the current study, we examined the association between brain amyloid-beta deposition, assessed via in vivo assessments of neocortical Pittsburgh compound B, and scores on an extensive neuropsychological battery of measures of cognitive functioning in 63 adults (31 male, 32 female) with Down syndrome aged 30-53 years who did not exhibit symptoms of dementia. Twenty-two of the adults with Down syndrome were identified as having elevated neocortical Pittsburgh compound B retention levels. There was a significant positive correlation (r = 0.62, P < 0.0001) between age and neocortical Pittsburgh compound B retention. This robust association makes it difficult to discriminate normative age-related decline in cognitive functioning from any potential effects of amyloid-beta deposition. When controlling for chronological age in addition to mental age, there were no significant differences between the adults with Down syndrome who had elevated neocortical Pittsburgh compound B retention levels and those who did not on any of the neuropsychological measures. Similarly, when examining Pittsburgh compound B as a continuous variable, after controlling for mental age and chronological age, only the Rivermead Picture Recognition score was significantly negatively associated with neocortical Pittsburgh compound B retention. Our findings indicate that many adults with Down syndrome can tolerate amyloid-beta deposition without deleterious effects on cognitive functioning. However, we may have obscured true effects of amyloid-beta deposition by controlling for chronological age in our analyses. Moreover, our sample included adults with Down syndrome who were most 'resistant' to the effects of amyloid-beta deposition, as adults already exhibiting clinical symptoms of dementia symptoms were excluded from the study.

24995708|t|A distinct subfraction of Abeta is responsible for the high-affinity Pittsburgh compound B-binding site in Alzheimer's disease brain.
24995708|a|The positron emission tomography (PET) ligand (11) C-labeled Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) is used to image beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposits in the brains of living subjects with the intent of detecting early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, deposits of human-sequence Abeta in amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice and non-human primates bind very little PIB. The high stoichiometry of PIB:Abeta binding in human AD suggests that the PIB-binding site may represent a particularly pathogenic entity and/or report local pathologic conditions. In this study, (3) H-PIB was employed to track purification of the PIB-binding site in > 90% yield from frontal cortical tissue of autopsy-diagnosed AD subjects. The purified PIB-binding site comprises a distinct, highly insoluble subfraction of the Abeta in AD brain with low buoyant density because of the sodium dodecyl sulfate-resistant association with a limited subset of brain proteins and lipids with physical properties similar to lipid rafts and to a ganglioside:Abeta complex in AD and Down syndrome brain. Both the protein and lipid components are required for PIB binding. Elucidation of human-specific biological components and pathways will be important in guiding improvement of the animal models for AD and in identifying new potential therapeutic avenues. A lipid-associated subpopulation of Abeta accounts for the high-affinity binding of Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) in Alzheimer's disease brain. Mass spectrometry of the isolated PIB-binding site from frontal cortex identified Abeta peptides and a set of plaque-associated proteins in AD but not age-matched normal brain. The PIB-binding site may represent a particularly pathogenic entity and/or report local pathologic conditions.

24996204|t|The 2013 SFRBM discovery award: selected discoveries from the butterfield laboratory of oxidative stress and its sequela in brain in cognitive disorders exemplified by Alzheimer disease and chemotherapy induced cognitive impairment.
24996204|a|This retrospective review on discoveries of the roles of oxidative stress in brain of subjects with Alzheimer disease (AD) and animal models thereof as well as brain from animal models of chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (CICI) results from the author receiving the 2013 Discovery Award from the Society for Free Radical Biology and Medicine. The paper reviews our laboratory's discovery of protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation in AD brain regions rich in amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) but not in Abeta-poor cerebellum; redox proteomics as a means to identify oxidatively modified brain proteins in AD and its earlier forms that are consistent with the pathology, biochemistry, and clinical presentation of these disorders; how Abeta in in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro studies can lead to oxidative modification of key proteins that also are oxidatively modified in AD brain; the role of the single methionine residue of Abeta(1-42) in these processes; and some of the potential mechanisms in the pathogenesis and progression of AD. CICI affects a significant fraction of the 14 million American cancer survivors, and due to diminished cognitive function, reduced quality of life of the persons with CICI (called "chemobrain" by patients) often results. A proposed mechanism for CICI employed the prototypical ROS-generating and non-blood brain barrier (BBB)-penetrating chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin (Dox, also called adriamycin, ADR). Because of the quinone moiety within the structure of Dox, this agent undergoes redox cycling to produce superoxide free radical peripherally. This, in turn, leads to oxidative modification of the key plasma protein, apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1). Oxidized ApoA1 leads to elevated peripheral TNFalpha, a proinflammatory cytokine that crosses the BBB to induce oxidative stress in brain parenchyma that affects negatively brain mitochondria. This subsequently leads to apoptotic cell death resulting in CICI. This review outlines aspects of CICI consistent with the clinical presentation, biochemistry, and pathology of this disorder. To the author's knowledge this is the only plausible and self-consistent mechanism to explain CICI. These two different disorders of the CNS affect millions of persons worldwide. Both AD and CICI share free radical-mediated oxidative stress in brain, but the source of oxidative stress is not the same. Continued research is necessary to better understand both AD and CICI. The discoveries about these disorders from the Butterfield Laboratory that led to the 2013 Discovery Award from the Society of Free Radical and Medicine provide a significant foundation from which this future research can be launched.

24996404|t|Disrupted Intrinsic Networks Link Amyloid-beta Pathology and Impaired Cognition in Prodromal Alzheimer's Disease.
24996404|a|Amyloid-beta pathology (Abeta) and impaired cognition characterize Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, neural mechanisms that link Abeta-pathology with impaired cognition are incompletely understood. Large-scale intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) are potential candidates for this link: Abeta-pathology affects specific networks in early AD, these networks show disrupted connectivity, and they process specific cognitive functions impaired in AD, like memory or attention. We hypothesized that, in AD, regional changes of ICNs, which persist across rest- and cognitive task-states, might link Abeta-pathology with impaired cognition via impaired intrinsic connectivity. Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-positron emission tomography reflecting in vivo Abeta-pathology, resting-state fMRI, task-fMRI, and cognitive testing were used in patients with prodromal AD and healthy controls. In patients, default mode network's (DMN) functional connectivity (FC) was reduced in the medial parietal cortex during rest relative to healthy controls, relatively increased in the same region during an attention-demanding task, and associated with patients' cognitive impairment. Local PiB-uptake correlated negatively with DMN connectivity. Importantly, corresponding results were found for the right lateral parietal region of an attentional network. Finally, structural equation modeling confirmed a direct influence of DMN resting-state FC on the association between Abeta-pathology and cognitive impairment. Data provide evidence that disrupted intrinsic network connectivity links Abeta-pathology with cognitive impairment in early AD.

24997450|t|Mixed oligomers and monomeric amyloid-beta disrupts endothelial cells integrity and reduces monomeric amyloid-beta transport across hCMEC/D3 cell line as an in vitro blood-brain barrier model.
24997450|a|Senile amyloid plaques are one of the diagnostic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the severity of clinical symptoms of AD is weakly correlated with the plaque load. AD symptoms severity is reported to be more strongly correlated with the level of soluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) assemblies. Formation of soluble Abeta assemblies is stimulated by monomeric Abeta accumulation in the brain, which has been related to its faulty cerebral clearance. Studies tend to focus on the neurotoxicity of specific Abeta species. There are relatively few studies investigating toxic effects of Abeta on the endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We hypothesized that a soluble Abeta pool more closely resembling the in vivo situation composed of a mixture of Abeta40 monomer and Abeta42 oligomer would exert higher toxicity against hCMEC/D3 cells as an in vitro BBB model than either component alone. We observed that, in addition to a disruptive effect on the endothelial cells integrity due to enhancement of the paracellular permeability of the hCMEC/D3 monolayer, the Abeta mixture significantly decreased monomeric Abeta transport across the cell culture model. Consistent with its effect on Abeta transport, Abeta mixture treatment for 24h resulted in LRP1 down-regulation and RAGE up-regulation in hCMEC/D3 cells. The individual Abeta species separately failed to alter Abeta clearance or the cell-based BBB model integrity. Our study offers, for the first time, evidence that a mixture of soluble Abeta species, at nanomolar concentrations, disrupts endothelial cells integrity and its own transport across an in vitro model of the BBB.

24998414|t|Prediabetes-induced vascular alterations exacerbate central pathology in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice.
24998414|a|Age remains the main risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) although certain metabolic alterations, including prediabetes and hyperinsulinemia, also increase this risk. We present a mouse model of AD (APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse) with severe hyperinsulinemia induced by long-term high fat diet (HFD) treatment. After 23 weeks on HFD learning and memory processes were compromised. We observed a significant increase in tau hyperphosphorylation and Abeta pathology, including Abeta levels and amyloid burden. Microglia activation was also significantly increased in HFD-treated mice, both in close proximity to and far from senile plaques. Insulin degrading enzyme and neprilysin levels were not affected, suggesting that Abeta degradation pathways were preserved, whereas we detected an increase in spontaneous cortical bleeding that could underlay an impairment of Abeta interstitial fluid drainage, contributing to the increase in Abeta deposition in APP/PS1-HFD mice. Altogether our data suggest that early hyperinsulinemia is enough to exacerbate AD pathology observed in APP/PS1 mice, and supports the role of insulin-resistance therapies to stop or delay central complications associated.

24998676|t|Differential role of APP and APLPs for neuromuscular synaptic morphology and function.
24998676|a|The analysis of mouse models indicated that APP and the related APLPs are important for synapse formation and function. The synaptic role of APP is, however, complex due to partially overlapping functions within the gene family. APP/APLPs are proteolytically cleaved and have both adhesive and signaling properties. Mice lacking individual APP family members are viable, whereas APP/APLP2 and APLP1/APLP2 double knockout (DKO) mice die shortly after birth. Here, we analyzed the morphology of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) of lethal APLP1/APLP2-DKO mice in comparison to lethal APP/APLP2-DKO mutants and viable single KO mice. We report that, surprisingly, the NMJ phenotype of APLP1/APLP2-DKO mice shows striking differences as compared to APP/APLP2-DKO mice. Unexpectedly, APLP1/APLP2-DKO mice exhibit normal endplate patterning and lack presynaptic nerve terminal sprouting. However, at the level of individual synapses we show that APLP1/APLP2-DKO mice exhibit reduced size of pre- and postsynaptic compartments and reduced colocalization. As APP/APLP2-DKO and APLP1/APLP2-DKO mice show similar penetrance of early postnatal lethality, this suggests that deficits at the level of individual synapses due to impaired synaptic apposition and/or deficits in transmitter release may cause lethality. Using an in vitro cell-adhesion assay, we observed that APP trans-dimerization is considerably less efficient than APLP2 trans-interaction. Thus, differences between APP/APLP2 and APP/APLP1 NMJ formation may be in part explained by differences in APP/APLP2 trans-dimerization properties. Collectively, our study further highlights the distinct and essential role of APLP2 at NMJ synapses that cannot be compensated by APP.

24999038|t|Reduced glucose uptake and Abeta in brain regions with hyperintensities in connected white matter.
24999038|a|Interstitial concentration of amyloid beta (Ass) is positively related to synaptic activity in animal experiments. In humans, Ass deposition in Alzheimer's disease overlaps with cortical regions highly active earlier in life. White matter lesions (WML) disrupt connections between gray matter (GM) regions which in turn changes their activation patterns. Here, we tested if WML are related to Ass accumulation (measured with PiB-PET) and glucose uptake (measured with FDG-PET) in connected GM. WML masks from 72 cognitively normal (age 61.7 +- 9.6 years, 71% women) individuals were obtained from T2-FLAIR. MRI and PET images were normalized into common space, segmented and parcellated into gray matter (GM) regions. The effects of WML on connected GM regions were assessed using the Change in Connectivity (ChaCo) score. Defined for each GM region, ChaCo is the percentage of WM tracts connecting to that region that pass through the WML mask. The regional relationship between ChaCo, glucose uptake and Ass was explored via linear regression. Subcortical regions of the bilateral caudate, putamen, calcarine, insula, thalamus and anterior cingulum had WM connections with the most lesions, followed by frontal, occipital, temporal, parietal and cerebellar regions. Regional analysis revealed that GM with more lesions in connecting WM and thus impaired connectivity had lower FDG-PET (r = 0.20, p<0.05 corrected) and lower PiB uptake (r = 0.28, p<0.05 corrected). Regional regression also revealed that both ChaCo (beta = 0.045) and FDG-PET (beta = 0.089) were significant predictors of PiB. In conclusion, brain regions with more lesions in connecting WM had lower glucose metabolism and lower Ass deposition.

25000142|t|Interaction of Alzheimer's beta-amyloid peptides with cholesterol: mechanistic insights into amyloid pore formation.
25000142|a|Brain cholesterol plays a critical role in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. The molecular mechanisms linking cholesterol to neurotoxicity have remained elusive for a long time, but recent data have allowed the identification of functional cholesterol-binding domains in several amyloidogenic proteins involved in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. In this review, we analyze the cholesterol binding properties of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides and the impact of these interactions on amyloid pore formation. We show that although the cholesterol-binding domains of Abeta peptides and of transmembrane precursor C99 are partially overlapping, they involve distinct amino acid residues, so that cholesterol has a greater affinity for Abeta than for C99. Synthetic 22-35 and 25-35 fragments of Abeta retained the ability of the full-length peptide 1-42 to bind cholesterol and to form zinc-sensitive, calcium-permeable amyloid pores in cultured neural cells. Studies with mutant peptides allowed the identification of key residues involved in cholesterol binding and channel formation. Cholesterol promoted the insertion of Abeta in the plasma membrane, induced alpha-helical structuration, and forced the peptide to adopt a tilted topology that favored the oligomerization process. Bexarotene, an amphipathic drug currently considered as a potential candidate medication for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, competed with cholesterol for binding to Abeta and prevented oligomeric channel formation. These studies indicate that it is possible to prevent the generation of neurotoxic oligomers by targeting the cholesterol-binding domain of Abeta peptides. This original strategy could be used for the treatment of Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases that involve cholesterol-dependent toxic oligomers.

25001178|t|MicroRNA-125b induces tau hyperphosphorylation and cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease.
25001178|a|Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, but no clear disease-initiating mechanism is known. Abeta deposits and neuronal tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau are characteristic for AD. Here, we analyze the contribution of microRNA-125b (miR-125b), which is elevated in AD. In primary neurons, overexpression of miR-125b causes tau hyperphosphorylation and an upregulation of p35, cdk5, and p44/42-MAPK signaling. In parallel, the phosphatases DUSP6 and PPP1CA and the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-W are downregulated as direct targets of miR-125b. Knockdown of these phosphatases induces tau hyperphosphorylation, and overexpression of PPP1CA and Bcl-W prevents miR-125b-induced tau phosphorylation, suggesting that they mediate the effects of miR-125b on tau. Conversely, suppression of miR-125b in neurons by tough decoys reduces tau phosphorylation and kinase expression/activity. Injecting miR-125b into the hippocampus of mice impairs associative learning and is accompanied by downregulation of Bcl-W, DUSP6, and PPP1CA, resulting in increased tau phosphorylation in vivo. Importantly, DUSP6 and PPP1CA are also reduced in AD brains. These data implicate miR-125b in the pathogenesis of AD by promoting pathological tau phosphorylation.

25003233|t|mNos2 deletion and human NOS2 replacement in Alzheimer disease models.
25003233|a|Understanding the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying Alzheimer disease relies on knowledge of disease onset and the sequence of development of brain pathologies. We present a comprehensive analysis of early and progressive changes in a mouse model that demonstrates a full spectrum of characteristic Alzheimer disease-like pathologies. This model demonstrates an altered immune redox state reminiscent of the human disease and capitalizes on data indicating critical differences between human and mouse immune responses, particularly in nitric oxide levels produced by immune activation of the NOS2 gene. Using the APPSwDI(+)/(+)mNos2(-/-) (CVN-AD) mouse strain, we show a sequence of pathologic events leading to neurodegeneration,which include pathologically hyperphosphorylated tau in the perforant pathway at 6 weeks of age progressing to insoluble tau, early appearance of beta-amyloid peptides in perivascular deposits around blood vessels in brain regions known to be vulnerable to Alzheimer disease, and progression to damage and overt loss in select vulnerable neuronal populations in these regions. The role of species differences between hNOS2 and mNos2 was supported by generating mice in which the human NOS2 gene replaced mNos2. When crossed with CVN-AD mice, pathologic characteristics of this new strain (APPSwDI(+)/(-)/HuNOS2(tg+)/(+)/mNos2(-/-)) mimicked the pathologic phenotypes found in the CVN-AD strain.

25003381|t|Influence of the polypeptide environment next to amyloidogenic peptides on fibril formation.
25003381|a|Alternative folding or fibril formation of proteins is associated with many diseases. Although uncertainty remains for many diseases as to whether the fibrils themselves constitute the main pathogenicity factor, the biophysics or molecular steps leading to fibrils cannot easily be reduced to a common denominator. To date, it is known that fibrils can form (i) upon aberrant (over-)production or false processing, (ii) upon infection with prions that act as seeds and induce unfolding of a thus far native protein--as has been shockingly experienced during the bovine spongiform encephalopathy episode, (iii) when mutations are present that increase the propensity of an otherwise stable protein to aggregate, or (iv) when mutation decreases the overall stability of an individual protein. This review intends to highlight some of the biochemical and biophysical mechanisms that favor fibril formation. Special emphasis is given on the relevance of the polypeptide environment of amyloidogenic segments and the currently discussed driving forces of fibril formation.

25004204|t|Adipose and leptomeningeal arteriole endothelial dysfunction induced by beta-amyloid peptide: a practical human model to study Alzheimer's disease vasculopathy.
25004204|a|BACKGROUND: Evidence point to vascular dysfunction and hypoperfusion as early abnormalities in Alzheimer's disease (AD); probing their mechanistic bases can lead to new therapeutic approaches. We tested the hypotheses that beta-amyloid peptide induces endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress in human microvasculature and that response will be similar between peripheral adipose and brain leptomeningeal arterioles. NEW METHOD: Abdominal subcutaneous arterioles from living human subjects (n=17) and cadaver leptomeningeal arterioles (n=6) from rapid autopsy were exposed to Abeta1-42 (Abeta) for 1-h and dilation response to acetylcholine/papaverine were measured and compared to baseline response. Adipose arteriole reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and nitrotyrosine content were measured. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Methods described allow direct investigation of human microvessel functional response that cannot be replicated by human noninvasive imaging or post-mortem histology. RESULTS: Adipose arterioles exposed to 2 muM Abeta showed impaired dilation to acetylcholine that was reversed by antioxidant polyethylene glycol superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD) (Abeta-60.9 +- 6%, control-93.2 +- 1.8%, Abeta+PEGSOD-84.7 +- 3.9%, both p<0.05 vs. Abeta). Abeta caused reduced dilation to papaverine. Abeta increased adipose arteriole ROS production and increased arteriole nitrotyrosine content. Leptomeningeal arterioles showed similar impaired response to acetylcholine when exposed to Abeta (43.0 +- 6.2% versus 81.1 +- 5.7% control, p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Abeta exposure induced adipose arteriole endothelial and non-endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress that were reversed by antioxidant treatment. Abeta-induced endothelial dysfunction was similar between peripheral adipose and leptomeningeal arterioles. Ex vivo living adipose and cadaver leptomeningeal arterioles are viable, novel and practical human tissue models to study Alzheimer's vascular pathophysiology.

25004796|t|The molecular mechanism of fullerene-inhibited aggregation of Alzheimer's beta-amyloid peptide fragment.
25004796|a|Amyloid deposits are implicated in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The inhibition of beta-sheet formation has been considered as the primary therapeutic strategy for AD. Increasing data show that nanoparticles can retard or promote the fibrillation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides depending on the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles, however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. In this study, our replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations show that fullerene nanoparticle - C60 (with a fullerene :  peptide molar ratio greater than 1 : 8) can dramatically prevent beta-sheet formation of Abeta(16-22) peptides. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments further confirm the inhibitory effect of C60 on Abeta(16-22) fibrillation, in support of our REMD simulations. An important finding from our REMD simulations is that fullerene C180, albeit with the same number of carbon atoms as three C60 molecules (3C60) and smaller surface area than 3C60, displays an unexpected stronger inhibitory effect on the beta-sheet formation of Abeta(16-22) peptides. A detailed analysis of the fullerene-peptide interaction reveals that the stronger inhibition of beta-sheet formation by C180 results from the strong hydrophobic and aromatic-stacking interactions of the fullerene hexagonal rings with the Phe rings relative to the pentagonal rings. The strong interactions between the fullerene nanoparticles and Abeta(16-22) peptides significantly weaken the peptide-peptide interaction that is important for beta-sheet formation, thus retarding Abeta(16-22) fibrillation. Overall, our studies reveal the significant role of fullerene hexagonal rings in the inhibition of Abeta(16-22) fibrillation and provide novel insight into the development of drug candidates against Alzheimer's disease.

25005263|t|Self-assembling nanofibers alter the processing of amyloid precursor protein in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
25005263|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common dementia, which is not effectively cured to date. Amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition cascade and disintegrity of brain extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffold attribute to the progress of AD. Thus, it maybe an effective way to treat AD by altering the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and regaining the integrity of ECM. The peptide amphiphile (PA) with a laminin epitope isoleucine-lysine-valine-alanine-valine (IKVAV) (IKVAV-PA) can be trigged into ECM in vivo. In addition, IKVAV-PA could significantly improve cognitive impairment with remarkable increase of endoneurogensis in the hippocampus, as well as reduction of burden of amyloid plaque in the brain. METHODS: We used heterozygous AbetaPPswe/PS1dE9 double transgenic mice as the animal model of AD. After 1 week of initial stereotaxic administration into bilateral hippocampus, the mice were subjected to the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test. At the end of MWM test, immunohistochemical staining, Western blot and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed in mice. RESULTS: Here we showed that IKVAV-PA significantly improved cognitive impairment accompanying with reducing the burden of Abeta plaques, as well as the levels of soluble Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 in the cortex and hippocampus after 2 weeks of initial administration into bilateral hippocampus. Further examination demonstrated that IKVAV-PA also altered the processing of APP via inhibiting the gene expression of beta-secretase (BACE1), as well as improving the gene expression of insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) and neprilysin (NEP). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that IKVAV-PA may serve as an alternative therapeutic intervention for treating the learning and memory losses in AD.

25008180|t|Insulin reverses the high-fat diet-induced increase in brain Abeta and improves memory in an animal model of Alzheimer disease.
25008180|a|Defects in insulin production and signaling are suspected to share a key role in diabetes and Alzheimer disease (AD), two age-related pathologies. In this study, we investigated the interrelation between AD and diabetes using a high-fat diet (HFD) in a mouse model of genetically induced AD-like neuropathology (3xTg-AD). We first observed that cerebral expression of human AD transgenes led to peripheral glucose intolerance, associated with pancreatic human Abeta accumulation. High-fat diet enhanced glucose intolerance, brain soluble Abeta, and memory impairment in 3xTg-AD mice. Strikingly, a single insulin injection reversed the deleterious effects of HFD on memory and soluble Abeta levels, partly through changes in Abeta production and/or clearance. Our results are consistent with the development of a vicious cycle between AD and diabetes, potentiating both peripheral metabolic disorders and AD neuropathology. The capacity of insulin to rapidly break the deleterious effects of this cycle on soluble Abeta concentrations and memory has important therapeutic implications.

25008761|t|Neuroprotective role of MMP-9 overexpression in the brain of Alzheimer's 5xFAD mice.
25008761|a|Accumulation of amyloid-beta (Alphabeta) peptide is believed to play a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Lowering Abeta levels in the brain may thus improve synaptic and cognitive deficits observed in AD patients. In the non-amyloidogenic pathway, the amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) is cleaved within the Abeta peptide sequence by alpha-secretases, giving rise to the potent neurotrophic N-terminal fragment sAlphaPPalpha. We have previously reported that gelatinase B/matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), a matrix metalloproteinase critically involved in neuronal plasticity, acts as alpha-secretase both in vitro and in vivo and reduces Abeta levels in vitro. In the present study, we demonstrate that neuronal overexpression of MMP-9 in a transgenic AD mouse model harboring five familial AD-related mutations (5xFAD) resulted in increased sAPPalpha levels and decreased Abeta oligomers without affecting amyloid plaque load in the brain. Functionally, overexpression of MMP-9 prevented the cognitive deficits displayed by 5xFAD mice, an improvement that was accompanied by increased levels of the pre-synaptic protein synaptophysin and mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the brain. These results suggest that in vivo activation of endogenous MMP-9 could be a promising target for interference with development and/or progression of AD.

25008854|t|Height-for-age z scores increase despite increasing height deficits among children in 5 developing countries.
25008854|a|BACKGROUND: Growth failure remains a persistent challenge in many countries, and understanding child growth patterns is critical to the development of appropriate interventions and their evaluation. The interpretation of changes in mean height-for-age z scores (HAZs) over time to define catch-up growth has been a subject of debate. Most studies of child growth have been cross-sectional or have focused on children through age 5 y. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to characterize patterns of linear growth among individuals followed from birth into adulthood. DESIGN: We compared HAZs and difference in height (cm) from the WHO reference median at birth, 12 mo, 24 mo, mid-childhood, and adulthood for 5287 individuals from birth cohorts in Brazil, Guatemala, India, the Philippines, and South Africa. RESULTS: Mean HAZs were <0 at birth in the 3 cohorts with data and ranged from -0.6 (Brazil) to -2.9 (Guatemala) at age 24 mo. Between 24 mo and mid-childhood, HAZ values increased by 0.3-0.5 in South Africa, Guatemala, and the Philippines and were unchanged in Brazil and India. Between mid-childhood and adulthood, mean HAZs increased in all cohorts but remained <0 in adulthood [mean range: -0.3 (Brazil) to -1.8 (Guatemala and Philippines)]. However, from 24 mo to adulthood, height differences from the reference median became greater. CONCLUSIONS: From age 2 y to adulthood, mean HAZs increased, even though height deficits relative to the reference median also increased. These 2 metrics may result in different interpretations of the potential for and the impact of catch-up growth in height.

25009180|t|Allosteric regulation of gamma-secretase activity by a phenylimidazole-type gamma-secretase modulator.
25009180|a|gamma-Secretase is an intramembrane-cleaving protease responsible for the generation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides. Recently, a series of compounds called gamma-secretase modulators (GSMs) has been shown to decrease the levels of long toxic Abeta species (i.e., Abeta42), with a concomitant elevation of the production of shorter Abeta species. In this study, we show that a phenylimidazole-type GSM allosterically induces conformational changes in the catalytic site of gamma-secretase to augment the proteolytic activity. Analyses using the photoaffinity labeling technique and systematic mutational studies revealed that the phenylimidazole-type GSM targets a previously unidentified extracellular binding pocket within the N-terminal fragment of presenilin (PS). Collectively, we provide a model for the mechanism of action of the phenylimidazole-type GSM in which binding at the luminal side of PS induces a conformational change in the catalytic center of gamma-secretase to modulate Abeta production.

25009256|t|Specific calpain inhibition by calpastatin prevents tauopathy and neurodegeneration and restores normal lifespan in tau P301L mice.
25009256|a|Tau pathogenicity in Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies is thought to involve the generation of hyperphosphorylated, truncated, and oligomeric tau species with enhanced neurotoxicity, although the generative mechanisms and the implications for disease therapy are not well understood. Here, we report a striking rescue from mutant tau toxicity in the JNPL3 mouse model of tauopathy. We show that pathological activation of calpains gives rise to a range of potentially toxic forms of tau, directly, and by activating cdk5. Calpain overactivation in brains of these mice is accelerated as a result of the marked depletion of the endogenous calpain inhibitor, calpastatin. When levels of this inhibitor are restored in neurons of JNPL3 mice by overexpressing calpastatin, tauopathy is prevented, including calpain-mediated breakdown of cytoskeletal proteins, cdk5 activation, tau hyperphosphorylation, formation of potentially neurotoxic tau fragments by either calpain or caspase-3, and tau oligomerization. Calpastatin overexpression also prevents loss of motor axons, delays disease onset, and extends survival of JNPL3 mice by 3 months to within the range of normal lifespan. Our findings support the therapeutic promise of highly specific calpain inhibition in the treatment of tauopathies and other neurodegenerative states.

25009704|t|Amelioration of Cognitive Dysfunction in APP/PS1 Double Transgenic Mice by Long-Term Treatment of 4-O-Methylhonokiol.
25009704|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease without known ways to cure. A key neuropathologic manifestation of the disease is extracellular deposition of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta). Specific mechanisms underlying the development of the disease have not yet been fully understood. In this study, we investigated effects of 4-O-methylhonokiol on memory dysfunction in APP/PS1 double transgenic mice. 4-O-methylhonokiol (1 mg/kg for 3 month) significantly reduced deficit in learning and memory of the transgenic mice, as determined by the Morris water maze test and step-through passive avoidance test. Our biochemical analysis suggested that 4-O-methylhonokiol ameliorated Abeta accumulation in the cortex and hippocampus via reduction in beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 expression. In addition, 4-O-methylhonokiol attenuated lipid peroxidation and elevated glutathione peroxidase activity in the double transgenic mice brains. Thus, suppressive effects of 4-O-methylhonokiol on Abeta generation and oxidative stress in the brains of transgenic mice may be responsible for the enhancement in cognitive function. These results suggest that the natural compound has potential to intervene memory deficit and progressive neurodegeneration in AD patients.

25010208|t|Effect of Taiwan mutation (D7H) on structures of amyloid-beta peptides: replica exchange molecular dynamics study.
25010208|a|Recent experiments have shown that the Taiwan mutation (D7H) slows the fibril formation of amyloid peptides Abeta40 and Abeta42. Motivated by this finding, we have studied the influence of D7H mutation on structures of Abeta peptide monomers using the replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations with OPLS force field and implicit water model. Our study reveals that the mechanism behind modulation of aggregation rates is associated with decrease of beta-content and dynamics of the salt bridge D23-K28. Estimating the bending free energy of this salt bridge, we have found that, in agreement with the experiments, the fibril formation rate of both peptides Abeta40 and Abeta42 is reduced about two times by mutation.

25010651|t|Identification of peptide products from enzymatic degradation of amyloid beta.
25010651|a|Deposition of insoluble amyloid plaques is one of the known hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid beta 1-42 is the main component in these plaques, and the soluble oligomers of this peptide are believed to contribute to synaptic degradation and dementia. Enzymatic hydrolysis of amyloid beta is important to keep its tissue concentration low to avoid oligomerization. We have employed four enzymes involved in in vivo degradation of amyloid beta, to identify amyloid beta 1-42 hydrolysis products in vitro. Liquid chromatography coupled to (high resolution) mass spectrometry was used to identify the proteolysis products. Novel cleavage sites were discovered for all four enzymes. For each enzyme, the peptide was incubated for several different periods from 0.5 to 210 min, and the proteolysis products from each period were characterized. Thus, both the initial cleavage sites and the full degradation profiles were revealed. Knowledge about the fate of amyloid beta is important to better understand the mechanism underlying Alzheimer's disease, and the reported proteolysis products can be used as targets in future investigations on amyloid beta clearance.

25010778|t|Deciphering an interplay of proteins associated with amyloid beta 1-42 peptide and molecular mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease.
25010778|a|Extracellular and intracellular accumulation of amyloid beta 1-42 peptide in different states of aggregation has been involved in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease. However, the precise mechanisms involved in amyloid beta peptide neurotoxicity have not been fully understood. There exists a wide variety of studies demonstrating the binding of amyloid beta peptide to a great variety of macromolecules and that such associations affect the cellular functions. This type of association involves proteins and receptors anchored to the plasma membrane of neurons or immune cells of the central nervous system as well as intracellular proteins that can alter intracellular transport, activate signaling pathways or affect proper mitochondrial function. In this review, we present some examples of such associations and the role played by these interactions, which are generally involved in the pathological progression of Alzheimer's disease.

25011528|t|Imaging the role of amyloid in PD dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies.
25011528|a|Cognitive impairment and dementia are significant sequelae of Parkinson disease (PD) and comprise a key feature of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), a disease with similar clinical and neuropathological features. Multiple independent causes have been implicated in PD dementia (PDD) and DLB, among them the accumulation of beta-amyloid, a neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer disease. Over the last decade, PET imaging has emerged as a viable method to measure amyloid burden in the human brain and relate it to neurodegenerative diseases. This article reviews what amyloid imaging has taught us about PDD and DLB. Current data suggest that brain amyloid deposition tends to be more marked in DLB, yet contributes to cognitive impairment in both DLB and PD. These results are broadly consistent with neuropathology and CSF studies. beta-Amyloid may interact synergistically with other pathological processes in PD and DLB to contribute to cognitive impairment.

25012224|t|A data-driven model of biomarker changes in sporadic Alzheimer's disease.
25012224|a|We demonstrate the use of a probabilistic generative model to explore the biomarker changes occurring as Alzheimer's disease develops and progresses. We enhanced the recently introduced event-based model for use with a multi-modal sporadic disease data set. This allows us to determine the sequence in which Alzheimer's disease biomarkers become abnormal without reliance on a priori clinical diagnostic information or explicit biomarker cut points. The model also characterizes the uncertainty in the ordering and provides a natural patient staging system. Two hundred and eighty-five subjects (92 cognitively normal, 129 mild cognitive impairment, 64 Alzheimer's disease) were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative with measurements of 14 Alzheimer's disease-related biomarkers including cerebrospinal fluid proteins, regional magnetic resonance imaging brain volume and rates of atrophy measures, and cognitive test scores. We used the event-based model to determine the sequence of biomarker abnormality and its uncertainty in various population subgroups. We used patient stages assigned by the event-based model to discriminate cognitively normal subjects from those with Alzheimer's disease, and predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment. The model predicts that cerebrospinal fluid levels become abnormal first, followed by rates of atrophy, then cognitive test scores, and finally regional brain volumes. In amyloid-positive (cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta1-42 < 192 pg/ml) or APOE-positive (one or more APOE4 alleles) subjects, the model predicts with high confidence that the cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers become abnormal in a distinct sequence: amyloid-beta1-42, phosphorylated tau, total tau. However, in the broader population total tau and phosphorylated tau are found to be earlier cerebrospinal fluid markers than amyloid-beta1-42, albeit with more uncertainty. The model's staging system strongly separates cognitively normal and Alzheimer's disease subjects (maximum classification accuracy of 99%), and predicts conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease (maximum balanced accuracy of 77% over 3 years), and from cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment (maximum balanced accuracy of 76% over 5 years). By fitting Cox proportional hazards models, we find that baseline model stage is a significant risk factor for conversion from both mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease (P = 2.06 x 10(-7)) and cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment (P = 0.033). The data-driven model we describe supports hypothetical models of biomarker ordering in amyloid-positive and APOE-positive subjects, but suggests that biomarker ordering in the wider population may diverge from this sequence. The model provides useful disease staging information across the full spectrum of disease progression, from cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease. This approach has broad application across neurodegenerative disease, providing insights into disease biology, as well as staging and prognostication.

25012867|t|Plasma proteins predict conversion to dementia from prodromal disease.
25012867|a|BACKGROUND: The study aimed to validate previously discovered plasma biomarkers associated with AD, using a design based on imaging measures as surrogate for disease severity and assess their prognostic value in predicting conversion to dementia. METHODS: Three multicenter cohorts of cognitively healthy elderly, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD participants with standardized clinical assessments and structural neuroimaging measures were used. Twenty-six candidate proteins were quantified in 1148 subjects using multiplex (xMAP) assays. RESULTS: Sixteen proteins correlated with disease severity and cognitive decline. Strongest associations were in the MCI group with a panel of 10 proteins predicting progression to AD (accuracy 87%, sensitivity 85%, and specificity 88%). CONCLUSIONS: We have identified 10 plasma proteins strongly associated with disease severity and disease progression. Such markers may be useful for patient selection for clinical trials and assessment of patients with predisease subjective memory complaints.

25014209|t|The N-terminal region of amyloid beta controls the aggregation rate and fibril stability at low pH through a gain of function mechanism.
25014209|a|Alzheimer's disease is linked to a pathological polymerization of the endogenous amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) that ultimately forms amyloid plaques within the human brain. We used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to measure the kinetic properties of Abeta fibril formation under different conditions during the polymerization process. For all polymerization processes, a critical concentration of free monomers, as defined by the dissociation equilibrium constant (K(D)), is required for the buildup of the polymer, for example, amyloid fibrils. At concentrations below the K(D), polymerization cannot occur. However, the K(D) for Abeta has previously been shown to be several orders of magnitude higher than the concentrations found in the cerebrospinal and interstitial fluids of the human brain, and the mechanism by which Abeta amyloid forms in vivo has been a matter of debate. Using SPR, we found that the K(D) of Abeta dramatically decreases as a result of lowering the pH. Importantly, this effect enables Abeta to polymerize within a picomolar concentration range that is close to the physiological Abeta concentration within the human brain. The stabilizing effect is dynamic, fully reversible, and notably pronounced within the pH range found within the endosomal and lysosomal pathways. Through sequential truncation, we show that the N-terminal region of Abeta contributes to the enhanced fibrillar stability due to a gain of function mechanism at low pH. Our results present a possible route for amyloid formation at very low Abeta concentrations and raise the question of whether amyloid formation in vivo is restricted to a low pH environment. These results have general implications for the development of therapeutic interventions.

25014537|t|ESEEM analysis of multi-histidine Cu(II)-coordination in model complexes, peptides, and amyloid-beta.
25014537|a|We validate the use of ESEEM to predict the number of (14)N nuclei coupled to a Cu(II) ion by the use of model complexes and two small peptides with well-known Cu(II) coordination. We apply this method to gain new insight into less explored aspects of Cu(II) coordination in amyloid-beta (Abeta). Abeta has two coordination modes of Cu(II) at physiological pH. A controversy has existed regarding the number of histidine residues coordinated to the Cu(II) ion in component II, which is dominant at high pH (~8.7) values. Importantly, with an excess amount of Zn(II) ions, as is the case in brain tissues affected by Alzheimer's disease, component II becomes the dominant coordination mode, as Zn(II) selectively substitutes component I bound to Cu(II). We confirm that component II only contains single histidine coordination, using ESEEM and set of model complexes. The ESEEM experiments carried out on systematically (15)N-labeled peptides reveal that, in component II, His 13 and His 14 are more favored as equatorial ligands compared to His 6. Revealing molecular level details of subcomponents in metal ion coordination is critical in understanding the role of metal ions in Alzheimer's disease etiology.

25016233|a|Optimization of an essentially inactive 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrano[3,2-c]quinoline carboxylic ester derivative as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) peripheral anionic site (PAS)-binding motif by double O   NH bioisosteric replacement, combined with molecular hybridization with the AChE catalytic anionic site (CAS) inhibitor 6-chlorotacrine and molecular dynamics-driven optimization of the length of the linker has resulted in the development of the trimethylene-linked 1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[h][1,6]naphthyridine-6-chlorotacrine hybrid 5a as a picomolar inhibitor of human AChE (hAChE). The tetra-, penta-, and octamethylene-linked homologues 5b-d have been also synthesized for comparison purposes, and found to retain the nanomolar hAChE inhibitory potency of the parent 6-chlorotacrine. Further biological profiling of hybrids 5a-d has shown that they are also potent inhibitors of human butyrylcholinesterase and moderately potent Abeta42 and tau anti-aggregating agents, with IC50 values in the submicromolar and low micromolar range, respectively. Also, in vitro studies using an artificial membrane model have predicted a good brain permeability for hybrids 5a-d, and hence, their ability to reach their targets in the central nervous system. The multitarget profile of the novel hybrids makes them promising leads for developing anti-Alzheimer drug candidates with more balanced biological activities.

25016970|t|Assessment of anti-amyloidogenic activity of marine red alga G. acerosa against Alzheimer's beta-amyloid peptide 25-35.
25016970|a|OBJECTIVE: The amyloid hypothesis stimulates the discovery of compounds, which promotes beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) clearance, thereby altering the underlying pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hence, the present study aims at the evaluation of anti-amyloidogenic potential of Gelidiella acerosa. METHODS: Prevention of Abeta 25-35 aggregate formation and disaggregation of pre-formed fibrils by G. acerosa was evaluated in three phases by thioflavin T spectrophotometric assay. The results were further validated by confocal microscopic analysis. The conformational changes in the aggregated and non-aggregated Abeta in the presence of G. acerosa were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic analysis. RESULTS: Phase-I study shows that G. acerosa reverts (4.56 +- 0.35 AU at 96 hours) the increase in fluorescence intensity of aggregated Abeta (18.76 +- 0.99 AU) significantly (P < 0.05) as that of non-aggregated peptides, which suggests that G. acerosa prevents the formation of oligomers from monomers. The seaweed also prevents the fibril formation even after the aggregation process was initiated at 20 hours, which was verified by the significant (P < 0.05) decrease in the fluorescence intensity (2.94 +- 0.0721 AU) at 36 hours (Phase II). In addition, G. acerosa promotes fibrillar destabilization (Phase III), which was further substantiated by confocal microscopic analysis. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy reveals that alteration in amide I and amide II band spectrum, which occurs due to Abeta 25-35 aggregation was restored upon co-treatment with G. acerosa benzene extract. CONCLUSION: Overall, the results suggest that G. acerosa might have direct interaction with the aggregated peptide, thereby preventing oligomerization and fibrillation of Abeta 25-35.

25017047|t|Estrogen receptor alpha promotes non-amyloidogenic processing of platelet amyloid precursor protein via the MAPK/ERK pathway.
25017047|a|Deposition of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta), a proteolytic product of amyloid precursor protein (APP), in senile plaques and in the walls of cerebral blood vessels is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Platelets contain high levels of APP and Abeta and may contribute to amyloid deposits seen in AD. However, the biochemical mechanism(s) involved in the regulation of platelet APP metabolism are largely unknown. The estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) is found to be expressed in platelets. It has not been elucidated whether ERalpha-mediated non-genomic signaling intervenes with platelet APP processing. Using ERalpha knock-out (alpha-ERKO) mice and wild type (WT) littermates, the present study demonstrated that ERalpha-specific agonist propylpyrazole triol (PPT) promoted non-amyloidogenic processing of platelet APP via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. The underlying basis involves direct association of activated ERK with a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain 17 (ADAM17, an alpha-secretase candidate) and ERK-dependent threonine phosphorylation of ADAM17. These results suggest that selective modulation of ERalpha in peripheral target tissues may serve as an anti-amyloidogenic strategy for AD and other amyloidogenic diseases.

25018108|t|Novel APP K724M mutation causes Chinese early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease and increases amyloid-beta42 to amyloid-beta40 ratio.
25018108|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder among the elderly individuals. Although there are several million cases of AD estimated in China with the most population in the world, no Chinese early-onset familial AD caused by new APP gene mutation has ever been reported. Here, we first described a Chinese family with early-onset AD that was inherited in autosomal dominant manner, and the age of onset was 46.6 +- 7.7 years (n = 5; range, 40-58 years). By using genetic analysis of 3 collected patients' DNA samples, we identified a heterozygous APP gene mutation (g.275363A>T, K724M according to APP770). Finally, when APP695 with K724M mutation was ectopically expressed in HEK293 cell, the ratio of amyloid-beta42 to amyloid-beta40 was 2.23-fold higher than that of wild-type control. Together, our data suggest that APP K724M gene mutation may contribute to the cause of this Chinese early-onset familial AD.

25019963|t|8-Hydroxyquinoline Schiff-base compounds as antioxidants and modulators of copper-mediated Abeta peptide aggregation.
25019963|a|One of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the brain are amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques, and metal ions such as copper(II) and zinc(II) have been shown to play a role in the aggregation and toxicity of the Abeta peptide, the major constituent of these extracellular aggregates. Metal binding agents can promote the disaggregation of Abeta plaques, and have shown promise as AD therapeutics. Herein, we describe the syntheses and characterization of an acetohydrazone (8-H2QH), a thiosemicarbazone (8-H2QT), and a semicarbazone (8-H2QS) derived from 8-hydroxyquinoline. The three compounds are shown to be neutral at pH7.4, and are potent antioxidants as measured by a Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) assay. The ligands form complexes with Cu(II), 8-H2QT in a 1:1 metal:ligand ratio, and 8-H2QH and 8-H2QS in a 1:2 metal:ligand ratio. A preliminary aggregation inhibition assay using the Abeta1-40 peptide showed that 8-H2QS and 8-H2QH inhibit peptide aggregation in the presence of Cu(II). Native gel electrophoresis/Western blot and TEM images were obtained to give a more detailed picture of the extent and pathways of Abeta aggregation using the more neurotoxic Abeta1-42 in the presence and absence of Cu(II), 8-H2QH, 8-H2QS and the drug candidate PBT2. An increase in the formation of oligomeric species is evident in the presence of Cu(II). However, in the presence of ligands and Cu(II), the results match those for the peptide alone, suggesting that the ligands function by sequestering Cu(II) and limiting oligomer formation in this assay.

25022335|t|Beta-amyloid auto-antibodies are reduced in Alzheimer's disease.
25022335|a|Accumulation and cytotoxicity of amyloid beta (Abeta) are understood as the major cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is evidence that naturally occurring antibodies against amyloid beta (Abeta) protein play a role in Abeta-clearance, and such a mechanism appears to be impaired in AD. In the present study, the anti-Abeta antibodies in the serum from individuals with and without late onset AD were measured using ELISA and dot-blot methods. Abeta auto-antibodies in serum were mainly targeted to Abeta1-15 epitope and its titer was significantly lower in AD patients than elderly non-AD controls (NC). The dot-blot analysis further demonstrated that auto-antibodies against fibrillar Abeta42, Abeta1-15 and Abeta16-30 epitopes were all in a lower level in AD than in NC. The isotypes of the auto-antibodies were mainly non-inflammatory IgG2 type. We also analyzed the relationship of auto-Abeta antibody levels with the genotypes of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and ANKK1/DRD2 gene.

25022538|t|Aggregate effects of vascular risk factors on cerebrovascular changes in autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer's disease.
25022538|a|We examined the relationships of antemortem vascular risk factors to postmortem cerebrovascular and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathologies. Eighty-four AD patients underwent an assessment of vascular risk (blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack [TIA], or stroke) and later underwent brain autopsy. Given our aim to examine mild cerebrovascular changes (CVCs), individuals were excluded if autopsy revealed large stroke. The most common forms of CVC were circle of Willis atherosclerosis followed by arteriosclerosis, lacunes, and microinfarcts. Excluding the history of TIA/clinical stroke, individual vascular risk factors were not associated with CVC. However, the presence of multiple vascular risk factors was associated with CVC. Furthermore, the presence of CVC was associated with lower Braak and Braak stage. These findings highlight the importance of aggregate risk in the vascular contribution to dementia. Interventions designed to maintain cerebrovascular health may represent important opportunities for preventing or delaying dementia, even when AD is the dominant pathology.

25022539|t|Plasma beta-amyloid 40 levels are positively associated with mortality risks in the elderly.
25022539|a|BACKGROUND: We evaluated if plasma beta-amyloid (Abeta) levels were associated with mortality risks in a subsample of the French Three-City (3C) prospective cohort study. METHODS: Analyses were based on 1254 participants randomly selected from the initial 3C cohort stratified by center, sex, and age in the context of a nested case-cohort study to investigate biological variables. Associations between plasma Abeta and mortality were assessed with the Cox regression model with delayed entry including various potential confounding factors and testing possible mediators. RESULTS: A relationship between high plasma Abeta1-40 concentrations and risk of mortality (hazards ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.31, P = .03) was unveiled independently of age, educational level, vascular risk factors, diet, physical activity, cognitive impairment, or frailty status. It was only modified when we included cystatin C levels. CONCLUSIONS: Further investigations are needed to determine precisely the pathophysiological roles of plasma Abeta1-40 and cystatin C and before envisioning any future clinical applications.

25023775|t|Phosphorylation of Ser8 promotes zinc-induced dimerization of the amyloid-beta metal-binding domain.
25023775|a|Zinc-induced aggregation of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is a hallmark molecular feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently it was shown that phosphorylation of Abeta at Ser8 promotes the formation of toxic aggregates. In this work, we have studied the impact of Ser8 phosphorylation on the mode of zinc interaction with the Abeta metal-binding domain 1-16 using isothermal titration calorimetry, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. We have discovered a novel zinc binding site ((6)HDpS(8)) in the phosphorylated peptide, in which the zinc ion is coordinated by the imidazole ring of His6, the phosphate group attached to Ser8 and a backbone carbonyl group of His6 or Asp7. Interaction of the zinc ion with this site involves His6, thereby withdrawing it from the interaction pattern observed in the non-modified peptide. This event was found to stimulate dimerization of peptide chains through the (11)EVHH(14) site, where the zinc ion is coordinated by the two pairs of Glu11 and His14 in the two peptide subunits. The proposed molecular mechanism of zinc-induced dimerization could contribute to the understanding of initiation of pathological Abeta aggregation, and the (11)EVHH(14) tetrapeptide can be considered as a promising drug target for the prevention of amyloidogenesis.

25024309|t|The prevalence of age-related macular degeneration in Alzheimer's disease.
25024309|a|BACKGROUND: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) share several features, including the presence of extracellular abnormal deposits associated with neuronal degeneration, drusen, and plaques, respectively. Investigation of any association of AMD and specifically AD is worthwhile but has rarely been done. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of AMD in subjects with AD in comparison with an age-matched cognitively normal cohort. METHODS: Cases were defined as those diagnosed with AD using standardized criteria as part of their clinical care, while controls were cognitively intact individuals aged 65 years or more. Dilated retinal photographs were taken, and a range of potentially confounding factors measured including APOE genotype. AMD features were recorded and AMD grades given. RESULTS: Data was collected on 322 controls and 258 cases. While AMD was associated with AD, and the proportion of cases of advanced AMD in AD cases was twice that of controls, when corrected the association was lost. AD was associated with age, the presence of an APOE allele, and smoking, while being 'generally unwell recently' was associated with a reduced risk of AD. CONCLUSION: AD and AMD are both associated with age, but our study does not find evidence they are associated with each other. However the retina offers an opportunity to non-invasively image neuronal tissue, and more sophisticated imaging techniques may shed light on ocular biomarkers of AD.

25024310|t|Positive relationship between mortality from Alzheimer's disease and soil metal concentration in mainland China.
25024310|a|An imbalance of metal ions is implicated in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated the relationship between the annual mortality of AD and ionic concentration (iron, zinc, copper, and aluminum) in the soil in mainland China. The AD annual mortality data were from 26 provinces and 3 municipal districts within mainland China between the years 1991 and 2000 and provided by the National Death Cause Surveillance Database of China. The ionic concentration in soil was provided by the China State Environmental Protection Bureau, which was published in 1990. The results showed that the relative risk of mortality in the regions with the highest copper concentrations (60-80 mg/kg) reached 2.634 (95% CI: 2.626-2.642) compared with the regions that had the lowest copper concentrations. The relative risk was 1.292 (95% CI: 1.290-1.294) and 1.248 (95% CI: 1.245-1.251) when the soil iron concentrations exceeded 3 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg, respectively. When the soil zinc concentration was over 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg, the relative risk was 1.870 (95% CI: 1.859-1.881) and 2.289 (95% CI: 2.276-2.304), respectively. However, the relative risk was 0.560 (95% CI: 0.559-0.561), 0.604 (95% CI: 0.603-0.605), and 0.267 (95% CI: 0.265-0.268) when the soil aluminum concentration was over 6 mg/kg, 7 mg/kg, and 8 mg/kg, respectively. This study suggests that high concentrations of iron and copper in the soil might be associated with the high AD annual mortality in this region in China, while aluminum had no association with AD mortality.

25024339|t|RanBP9 modulates AICD localization and transcriptional activity via direct interaction with Tip60.
25024339|a|Proteolytic processing of the amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) occurs via alternative pathways, culminating with the production of the AbetaPP intracellular domain (AICD). AICD can translocate to the nucleus and regulate transcription, but its activity is modulated by interactions with other proteins. In the nucleus, AICD, FE65, and Tip60 associate into AFT complexes, which are targeted to nuclear spots which correspond to transcription factories. Here we report that RanBP9 interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of AbetaPP, through the NPXY internalization motif. Moreover, RanBP9 interaction with Tip60 is also described. The RanBP9-Tip60 interaction dramatically relocated RanBP9 from a widespread cellular distribution to nuclear speckles. AbetaPP processing is a central aspect in determining the protein's function and that of its resulting proteolytic fragments, among them AICD. The latter results from the amyloidogenic pathway and is the peptidic species predominantly involved in nuclear signaling. Of note RanBP9 transfection was previously demonstrated to increase amyloid-beta generation. Here we show that RanBP9 relocates AICD to the Tip60-enriched nuclear speckles, and prevented the formation of nuclear spots formation, having therefore a negative effect on AICD mediated nuclear signaling and consequently AFT complex formation. Furthermore, by transfecting cells with increasing amounts of RanBP9, the expression of AICD-regulated genes, including AbetaPP itself, was reduced. Given the data presented, one can deduce that RanBP9 has an inhibitory regulatory effect on AICD-mediated transcription and the effect is mediated by relocating AICD away from transcription factories.

25024345|t|Validation of a serum screen for Alzheimer's disease across assay platforms, species, and tissues.
25024345|a|BACKGROUND: There is a significant need for rapid and cost-effective biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) for advancement of clinical practice and therapeutic trials. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to cross-validate our previously published serum-based algorithm on an independent assay platform as well as validate across tissues and species. Preliminary analyses were conducted to examine the utility in distinguishing AD from non-AD neurological disease (Parkinson's disease, PD). METHODS: Serum proteins from our previously published algorithm were quantified from 150 AD cases and 150 controls on the Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) platform. Serum samples were analyzed from 49 PD cases and compared to a random sample of 51 AD cases and 62 controls. Support vector machines (SVM) were used to discriminate PD versus AD versus controls. Human and AD mouse model microvessel images were quantified with HAMAMATSU imaging software. Mouse serum biomarkers were assayed via MSD. RESULTS: Analysis of 21 serum proteins from 150 AD cases and 150 controls yielded an algorithm with sensitivity and specificity of 0.90 for correctly classifying AD. This multi-marker approach was then validated across species and tissue. Assay of the top proteins in human and AD mouse model brain microvessels correctly classified 90-100% of the samples. SVM analyses were highly accurate at distinguishing PD versus AD versus controls. CONCLUSIONS: This serum-based biomarker panel should be tested in a community-based setting to determine its utility as a first-line screen for AD and non-AD neurological diseases for primary care providers.

25024455|t|Sulforaphane ameliorates neurobehavioral deficits and protects the brain from amyloid beta deposits and peroxidation in mice with Alzheimer-like lesions.
25024455|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease in the elderly individuals and its effective therapies are still unavailable. This study was designed to investigate the neuroprotection of sulforaphane (SFN) in AD-lesion mice induced by combined administration of d-galactose and aluminium. Results showed that SFN ameliorated spatial cognitive impairment and locomotor activity decrease in Morris water maze and open field test, respectively. And attenuated numbers of amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques in both hippocampus and cerebral cortex of AD-lesion mice were detected by immunohistochemistry. According to spectrophotometry and quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction results, a significant increase in carbonyl group level and obvious decreases in both activity and messenger RNA expression of glutathione peroxidase were found in brain of AD-lesion mice compared with control, but not in SFN-treated AD-lesion mice. In conclusion, SFN ameliorates neurobehavioral deficits and protects the brain from Abeta deposits and peroxidation in mice with Alzheimer-like lesions, suggesting SFN is likely a potential phytochemical to be used in AD therapeutics.

25027006|t|Induced pluripotent stem cells from familial Alzheimer's disease patients differentiate into mature neurons with amyloidogenic properties.
25027006|a|Although the majority of Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases are sporadic, about 5% of cases are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern as familial AD (FAD) and manifest at an early age. Mutations in the presenilin 1 (PSEN1) gene account for the majority of early-onset FAD. Here, we describe the generation of virus-free human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) derived from fibroblasts of patients harboring the FAD PSEN1 mutation A246E and fibroblasts from healthy age-matched controls using nonintegrating episomal vectors. We have differentiated these hiPSC lines to the neuronal lineage and demonstrated that hiPSC-derived neurons have mature phenotypic and physiological properties. Neurons from mutant hiPSC lines express PSEN1-A246E mutations themselves and show AD-like biochemical features, that is, amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) indicated by an increase in beta-amyloid (Abeta)42/Abeta40 ratio. FAD hiPSCs harboring disease properties can be used as humanized models to test novel diagnostic methods and therapies and explore novel hypotheses for AD pathogenesis.

25027320|t|SUCLG2 identified as both a determinator of CSF Abeta1-42 levels and an attenuator of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.
25027320|a|Cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta1-42) and phosphorylated Tau at position 181 (pTau181) are biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We performed an analysis and meta-analysis of genome-wide association study data on Abeta1-42 and pTau181 in AD dementia patients followed by independent replication. An association was found between Abeta1-42 level and a single-nucleotide polymorphism in SUCLG2 (rs62256378) (P = 2.5x10(-12)). An interaction between APOE genotype and rs62256378 was detected (P = 9.5 x 10(-5)), with the strongest effect being observed in APOE-epsilon4 noncarriers. Clinically, rs62256378 was associated with rate of cognitive decline in AD dementia patients (P = 3.1 x 10(-3)). Functional microglia experiments showed that SUCLG2 was involved in clearance of Abeta1-42.

25027328|t|Deficiency of patched 1-induced Gli1 signal transduction results in astrogenesis in Swedish mutated APP transgenic mice.
25027328|a|Normally, sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling induces high levels of Patched 1 (Ptc1) and its associated transcription factor Gli1 with genesis of specific neuronal progeny. But their roles in the neural stem cells (NSCs), including glial precursor cells (GPCs), of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are unclear. Here, we show that Ptc1 and Gli1 are significantly deficits in the hippocampus of an aged AD transgenic mouse mode, whereas these two molecules are highly elevated at young ages. Our similar findings in autopsied AD brains validate the discovery in AD mouse models. To examine whether Abeta peptides, which are a main component of the amyloid plaques in AD brains, affected Ptc1-Gli1 signaling, we treated GPCs with Abeta peptides, we found that high dose of Abeta1-42 but not Abeta1-40 significantly decreased Ptc1-Gli1, while Shh itself was elevated in hippocampal NSCs/GPCs. Furthermore, we found that deficits of Ptc1-Gli1 signaling induced NSCs/GPCs into asymmetric division, which results in an increase in the number of dividing cells including transit-amplifying cells and neuroblasts. These precursor cells commit to apoptosis-like death under the toxic conditions. By this way, adult neural precursor cell pool is exhausted and defective neurogenesis happens in AD brains. Our findings suggest that Ptc1-Gli1 signaling deregulation resulting abnormal loss of GPCs may contribute to a cognition decline in AD brains. The novel findings elucidate a new molecular mechanism of adult NSCs/GPCs on neurogenesis and demonstrate a regulatory role for Ptc1-Gli1 in adult neural circuit integrity of the brain.

25027618|t|A routine method for cloning, expressing and purifying Abeta(1-42) for structural NMR studies.
25027618|a|Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a key technology in the biophysicist's toolbox for gaining atomic-level insight into structure and dynamics of biomolecules. Investigation of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) of Alzheimer's disease is one area where NMR has proven useful, and holds even more potential. A barrier to realizing this potential, however, is the expense of the isotopically enriched peptide required for most NMR work. Whereas most biomolecular NMR studies employ biosynthetic methods as a very cost-effective means to obtain isotopically enriched biomolecules, this approach has proven less than straightforward for Abeta. Furthermore, the notorious propensity of Abeta to aggregate during purification and handling reduces yields and increases the already relatively high costs of solid phase synthesis methods. Here we report our biosynthetic and purification developments that yield pure, uniformly enriched 15N and 13C15N Abeta(1-42), in excess of 10 mg/L of culture media. The final HPLC-purified product was stable for long periods, which we characterize by solution-state NMR, thioflavin T assays, circular dichroism, electrospray mass spectrometry, and dynamic light scattering. These developments should facilitate further investigations into Alzheimer's disease, and perhaps misfolding diseases in general.

25027688|t|Lymphopenia is an independent predictor of inferior outcome in papillary renal cell carcinoma.
25027688|a|PURPOSE: Lymphopenia as a likely index of poor systemic immunity is an independent predictor of inferior outcome in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We sought to evaluate the prognostic relevance of preoperative absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) in a cohort of patients with papillary RCC (PRCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospectively maintained, renal cancer database was analyzed. Patients with preoperative ALC, within 3 months before surgery, were eligible for the study. Those with multifocal or bilateral renal tumors were excluded. Correlations between ALC and age, gender, smoking, Charlson comorbidity index, pathologic T category, PRCC subtype, and TNM stage were evaluated. Differences in overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival by ALC status were assessed using the log-rank test and cumulative incident estimators, respectively. Cox proportional hazards model was used for multivariable analyses. RESULTS: A total of 192 patients met the inclusion criteria. As a continuous variable, preoperative ALC was associated with higher TNM stage (P = 0.001) and older age (P = 0.01). As a dichotomous variable, lymphopenia (<1,300 cells/microl) was associated with higher TNM stage (P = 0.003). On multivariable analyses, controlling for covariates, after a median follow-up of 37.3 months, lymphopenia was associated with inferior OS (hazard ratio = 2.3 [95% CI: 1.2-4.3], P = 0.011) and trended to significance for cancer-specific survival (P = 0.071). Among patients with nonmetastatic disease and lymphopenia, OS at 37.5 months was shorter compared with those with normal ALC (83% vs. 93%, P = 0.0006). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with PRCC, lymphopenia is associated with lower survival independent of TNM stage, age, and histology. ALC may provide an additional preoperative prognostic factor.

25028583|t|Development of the motivation to change lifestyle and health behaviours for dementia risk reduction scale.
25028583|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: It is not yet understood how attitudes concerning dementia risk may affect motivation to change health behaviours and lifestyle. This study was designed to develop a reliable and valid theory-based measure to understand beliefs underpinning the lifestyle and health behavioural changes needed for dementia risk reduction. METHODS: 617 participants aged >=50 years completed a theory-based questionnaire, namely, the Motivation to Change Lifestyle and Health Behaviours for Dementia Risk Reduction (MCLHB-DRR) scale. The MCLHB-DRR consists of 53 items, reflecting seven subscales of the Health Belief Model. RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analysis was performed and revealed that a seven-factor solution with 27 items fitted the data (comparative fit index = 0.920, root-mean-square error of approximation = 0.047) better than the original 53 items. Internal reliability (alpha = 0.608-0.864) and test-retest reliability (alpha = 0.552-0.776) were moderate to high. Measurement of invariance across gender and age was also demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: These results propose that the MCLHB-DRR is a useful tool in assessing the beliefs and attitudes of males and females aged >=50 years towards dementia risk reduction. This measure can be used in the development and evaluation of interventions aimed at dementia prevention.

25030513|t|Potential for primary prevention of Alzheimer's disease: an analysis of population-based data.
25030513|a|BACKGROUND: Recent estimates suggesting that over half of Alzheimer's disease burden worldwide might be attributed to potentially modifiable risk factors do not take into account risk-factor non-independence. We aimed to provide specific estimates of preventive potential by accounting for the association between risk factors. METHODS: Using relative risks from existing meta-analyses, we estimated the population-attributable risk (PAR) of Alzheimer's disease worldwide and in the USA, Europe, and the UK for seven potentially modifiable risk factors that have consistent evidence of an association with the disease (diabetes, midlife hypertension, midlife obesity, physical inactivity, depression, smoking, and low educational attainment). The combined PAR associated with the risk factors was calculated using data from the Health Survey for England 2006 to estimate and adjust for the association between risk factors. The potential of risk factor reduction was assessed by examining the combined effect of relative reductions of 10% and 20% per decade for each of the seven risk factors on projections for Alzheimer's disease cases to 2050. FINDINGS: Worldwide, the highest estimated PAR was for low educational attainment (19 1%, 95% CI 12 3-25 6). The highest estimated PAR was for physical inactivity in the USA (21 0%, 95% CI 5 8-36 6), Europe (20 3%, 5 6-35 6), and the UK (21 8%, 6 1-37 7). Assuming independence, the combined worldwide PAR for the seven risk factors was 49 4% (95% CI 25 7-68 4), which equates to 16 8 million attributable cases (95% CI 8 7-23 2 million) of 33 9 million cases. However, after adjustment for the association between the risk factors, the estimate reduced to 28 2% (95% CI 14 2-41 5), which equates to 9 6 million attributable cases (95% CI 4 8-14 1 million) of 33 9 million cases. Combined PAR estimates were about 30% for the USA, Europe, and the UK. Assuming a causal relation and intervention at the correct age for prevention, relative reductions of 10% per decade in the prevalence of each of the seven risk factors could reduce the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in 2050 by 8 3% worldwide. INTERPRETATION: After accounting for non-independence between risk factors, around a third of Alzheimer's diseases cases worldwide might be attributable to potentially modifiable risk factors. Alzheimer's disease incidence might be reduced through improved access to education and use of effective methods targeted at reducing the prevalence of vascular risk factors (eg, physical inactivity, smoking, midlife hypertension, midlife obesity, and diabetes) and depression.

25031267|t|Protein misfolding, congophilia, oligomerization, and defective amyloid processing in preeclampsia.
25031267|a|Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific disorder of unknown etiology and a leading contributor to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Because there is no cure other than delivery, preeclampsia is the leading cause of iatrogenic preterm birth. We show that preeclampsia shares pathophysiologic features with recognized protein misfolding disorders. These features include urine congophilia (affinity for the amyloidophilic dye Congo red), affinity for conformational state-dependent antibodies, and dysregulation of prototype proteolytic enzymes involved in amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing. Assessment of global protein misfolding load in pregnancy based on urine congophilia (Congo red dot test) carries diagnostic and prognostic potential for preeclampsia. We used conformational state-dependent antibodies to demonstrate the presence of generic supramolecular assemblies (prefibrillar oligomers and annular protofibrils), which vary in quantitative and qualitative representation with preeclampsia severity. In the first attempt to characterize the preeclampsia misfoldome, we report that the urine congophilic material includes proteoforms of ceruloplasmin, immunoglobulin free light chains, SERPINA1, albumin, interferon-inducible protein 6-16, and Alzheimer's beta-amyloid. The human placenta abundantly expresses APP along with prototype APP-processing enzymes, of which the alpha-secretase ADAM10, the beta-secretases BACE1 and BACE2, and the gamma-secretase presenilin-1 were all up-regulated in preeclampsia. The presence of beta-amyloid aggregates in placentas of women with preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction further supports the notion that this condition should join the growing list of protein conformational disorders. If these aggregates play a pathophysiologic role, our findings may lead to treatment for preeclampsia.

25031286|t|Cerebral perfusion alterations and cerebral amyloid in autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease.
25031286|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate alterations in cerebral blood flow (CBF) using arterial spin-labeled MRI in autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease (ADAD) mutation carriers (MCs) in relation to cerebral amyloid and compared with age-matched healthy controls. BACKGROUND: Recent work has identified alterations in CBF in elderly subjects with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer dementia using MRI. However, similar studies are lacking in ADAD. Subjects with ADAD are generally free of significant vascular disease and offer the opportunity to measure CBF early in the pathologic process before significant symptom onset when unique markers might be identified. METHODS: Fourteen MCs (presenilin-1 and amyloid beta precursor protein) (Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] 0 = 9, CDR 0.5 = 4, CDR 1 = 1) and 50 controls underwent 3-tesla pulsed arterial spin-labeled MRI. SPM8 was used to test the effect of MC status at the voxel level on CBF before and after controlling for age and CDR. RESULTS: MCs had decreased perfusion in the caudate and inferior striatum bilaterally even after controlling for age and CDR. In MCs, separate areas of decreased CBF were associated with increasing cerebral amyloid and to decreased performance of attention and executive function. CONCLUSIONS: Early CBF changes were identified in asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic subjects with ADAD, particularly in the anterior striatum. Furthermore, amyloid deposition was associated with decreased CBF in a number of regions including anterior and posterior cortical areas. Both amyloid and decreased CBF were associated with declines primarily in executive cognitive function.

25031394|t|Inhibitory interneuron progenitor transplantation restores normal learning and memory in ApoE4 knock-in mice without or with Abeta accumulation.
25031394|a|Excitatory and inhibitory balance of neuronal network activity is essential for normal brain function and may be of particular importance to memory. Apolipoprotein (apo) E4 and amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides, two major players in Alzheimer's disease (AD), cause inhibitory interneuron impairments and aberrant neuronal activity in the hippocampal dentate gyrus in AD-related mouse models and humans, leading to learning and memory deficits. To determine whether replacing the lost or impaired interneurons rescues neuronal signaling and behavioral deficits, we transplanted embryonic interneuron progenitors into the hippocampal hilus of aged apoE4 knock-in mice without or with Abeta accumulation. In both conditions, the transplanted cells developed into mature interneurons, functionally integrated into the hippocampal circuitry, and restored normal learning and memory. Thus, restricted hilar transplantation of inhibitory interneurons restores normal cognitive function in two widely used AD-related mouse models, highlighting the importance of interneuron impairments in AD pathogenesis and the potential of cell replacement therapy for AD. More broadly, it demonstrates that excitatory and inhibitory balance are crucial for learning and memory, and suggests an avenue for investigating the processes of learning and memory and their alterations in healthy aging and diseases.

25031402|t|Enhancing astrocytic lysosome biogenesis facilitates Abeta clearance and attenuates amyloid plaque pathogenesis.
25031402|a|In sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), impaired Abeta removal contributes to elevated extracellular Abeta levels that drive amyloid plaque pathogenesis. Extracellular proteolysis, export across the blood-brain barrier, and cellular uptake facilitate physiologic Abeta clearance. Astrocytes can take up and degrade Abeta, but it remains unclear whether this function is insufficient in AD or can be enhanced to accelerate Abeta removal. Additionally, age-related dysfunction of lysosomes, the major degradative organelles wherein Abeta localizes after uptake, has been implicated in amyloid plaque pathogenesis. We tested the hypothesis that enhancing lysosomal function in astrocytes with transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosome biogenesis, would promote Abeta uptake and catabolism and attenuate plaque pathogenesis. Exogenous TFEB localized to the nucleus with transcriptional induction of lysosomal biogenesis and function in vitro. This resulted in significantly accelerated uptake of exogenously applied Abeta42, with increased localization to and degradation within lysosomes in C17.2 cells and primary astrocytes, indicating that TFEB is sufficient to coordinately enhance uptake, trafficking, and degradation of Abeta. Stereotactic injection of adeno-associated viral particles carrying TFEB driven by a glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter was used to achieve astrocyte-specific expression in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Exogenous TFEB localized to astrocyte nuclei and enhanced lysosome function, resulting in reduced Abeta levels and shortened half-life in the brain interstitial fluid and reduced amyloid plaque load in the hippocampus compared with control virus-injected mice. Therefore, activation of TFEB in astrocytes is an effective strategy to restore adequate Abeta removal and counter amyloid plaque pathogenesis in AD.

25037005|t|Binding of Abeta peptide creates lipid density depression in DMPC bilayer.
25037005|a|Using isobaric-isothermal replica exchange molecular dynamics and all-atom explicit water model we study the impact of Abeta monomer binding on the equilibrium properties of DMPC bilayer. We found that partial insertion of Abeta peptide into the bilayer reduces the density of lipids in the binding "footprint" and indents the bilayer thus creating a lipid density depression. Our simulations also reveal thinning of the bilayer and a decrease in the area per lipid in the proximity of Abeta. Although structural analysis of lipid hydrophobic core detects disordering in the orientations of lipid tails, it also shows surprisingly minor structural perturbations in the tail conformations. Finally, partial insertion of Abeta monomer does not enhance water permeation through the DMPC bilayer and even causes considerable dehydration of the lipid-water interface. Therefore, we conclude that Abeta monomer bound to the DMPC bilayer fails to perturb the bilayer structure in both leaflets. Limited scope of structural perturbations in the DMPC bilayer caused by Abeta monomer may constitute the molecular basis of its low cytotoxicity.

25037226|t|Decreased amyloid-beta pathologies by intracerebral loading of glycosphingolipid-enriched exosomes in Alzheimer model mice.
25037226|a|Elevated levels of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) in the human brain are linked to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. Recent in vitro studies have demonstrated that extracellular Abeta can bind to exosomes, which are cell-secreted nanovesicles with lipid membranes that are known to transport their cargos intercellularly. Such findings suggest that the exosomes are involved in Abeta metabolism in brain. Here, we found that neuroblastoma-derived exosomes exogenously injected into mouse brains trapped Abeta and with the associated Abeta were internalized into brain-resident phagocyte microglia. Accordingly, continuous intracerebral administration of the exosomes into amyloid-beta precursor protein transgenic mice resulted in marked reductions in Abeta levels, amyloid depositions, and Abeta-mediated synaptotoxicity in the hippocampus. In addition, we determined that glycosphingolipids (GSLs), a group of membrane glycolipids, are highly abundant in the exosomes, and the enriched glycans of the GSLs are essential for Abeta binding and assembly on the exosomes both in vitro and in vivo. Our data demonstrate that intracerebrally administered exosomes can act as potent scavengers for Abeta by carrying it on the exosome surface GSLs and suggest a role of exosomes in Abeta clearance in the central nervous system. Improving Abeta clearance by exosome administration would provide a novel therapeutic intervention for Alzheimer disease.

25037228|t|The peculiar role of the A2V mutation in amyloid-beta (Abeta) 1-42 molecular assembly.
25037228|a|We recently reported a novel Abeta precursor protein mutation (A673V), corresponding to position 2 of Abeta1-42 peptides (Abeta1-42A2V), that caused an early onset AD-type dementia in a homozygous individual. The heterozygous relatives were not affected as an indication of autosomal recessive inheritance of this mutation. We investigated the folding kinetics of native unfolded Abeta1-42A2V in comparison with the wild type sequence (Abeta1-42WT) and the equimolar solution of both peptides (Abeta1-42MIX) to characterize the oligomers that are produced in the early phases. We carried out the structural characterization of the three preparations using electron and atomic force microscopy, fluorescence emission, and x-ray diffraction and described the soluble oligomer formation kinetics by laser light scattering. The mutation promoted a peculiar pathway of oligomerization, forming a connected system similar to a polymer network with hydrophobic residues on the external surface. Abeta1-42MIX generated assemblies very similar to those produced by Abeta1-42WT, albeit with slower kinetics due to the difficulties of Abeta1-42WT and Abeta1-42A2V peptides in building up of stable intermolecular interaction.

25038445|t|Pretreatment with antiasthmatic drug ibudilast ameliorates Abeta 1-42-induced memory impairment and neurotoxicity in mice.
25038445|a|Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is thought to be associated with the progressive neuronal death observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, effective neuroprotective approaches against Abeta neurotoxicity are unavailable. Here, we investigated possible preventive effects of ibudilast, as a pharmacologic phosphodiesterase inhibitor, currently used for treatment of inflammatory diseases such as asthma, on Abeta 1-42-induced neuroinflammatory, apoptotic responses and memory impairment. We found that pretreatment with ibudilast (4 or 12 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly ameliorated impaired spatial learning and memory in intracerebroventricularly (ICV) Abeta 1-42-injected mice, as evidenced by decrease in escape latency during acquisition trials and increase in exploratory activities in the probe trial in Morris water maze (MWM) task, and by increase in the number of correct choices and decrease in latency to enter the shock-free compartment in Y-maze test. Further study showed that ibudilast prevented generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as NF-kappaB p65 and TNF-alpha as well as pro-apoptotic molecule caspase-3 activation and anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 downregulation in both hippocampus and cortex of ICV Abeta 1-42-injected mice. Taken together, our findings suggest that ibudilast has preventive effects on Abeta-induced cognitive impairment via inhibiting neuroinflammatory and apoptotic responses.

25039425|t|Leptin inhibits amyloid beta-protein fibrillogenesis by decreasing GM1 gangliosides on the neuronal cell surface through PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.
25039425|a|Leptin is a centrally acting hormone that controls metabolic pathways. Recent epidemiological studies suggest that plasma leptin is protective against Alzheimer's disease. However, the mechanism that underlies this effect remains uncertain. To investigate whether leptin inhibits the assembly of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) on the cell surface of neurons, we treated primary neurons with leptin. Leptin treatment decreased the GM1 ganglioside (GM1) levels in the detergent-resistant membrane microdomains (DRMs) of neurons. The increase in GM1 expression induced by leptin was inhibited after pre-treatment with inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (LY294002), Akt (triciribine) and the mammalian target of rapamycin (i.e. rapamycin), but not by an inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (PD98059). In addition, pre-treatment with these reagents blocked the induction of GM1 in DRMs by leptin. Furthermore, Abeta assembly on the cell surface of neurons was inhibited greatly after treatment with leptin. This reduction was markedly inhibited after pre-treatment with LY294002, triciribine, and rapamycin. These results suggest that leptin significantly inhibits Abeta assembly by decreasing GM1 expression in DRMs of the neuronal surface through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the function of leptin in AD brains. In this study, our aim was to determine whether leptin regulates the expression and localization of GM1 on the neuronal membrane and if it induces the formation of Abeta assembly on the cell surface of neurons. Our results suggest that leptin regulates the expression of GM1 in DRMs of the neuronal membranes. Moreover, leptin does not seem to facilitate fibrillogenesis of exogenously added soluble Abeta from the cell surface of neurons.

25040401|t|Amyloid-abeta Peptide in olfactory mucosa and mesenchymal stromal cells of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease patients.
25040401|a|Patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) might develop olfactory dysfunction that correlates with progression of disease. Alteration of olfactory neuroepithelium associated with MCI may be useful as predictor of cognitive decline. Biomarkers with higher sensitivity and specificity would allow to understand the biological progression of the pathology in association with the clinical course of the disease. In this study, magnetic resonance images, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) load, Olfactory Connecticut test and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) indices were obtained from noncognitive impaired (NCI), MCI and AD patients. We established a culture of patient-derived olfactory stromal cells from biopsies of olfactory mucosa (OM) to test whether biological properties of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are concurrent with MCI and AD psychophysical pathology. We determined the expression of amyloid Abeta peptides in the neuroepithelium of tissue sections from MCI and AD, as well as in cultured cells of OM. Reduced migration and proliferation of stromal (CD90(+) ) cells in MCI and AD with respect to NCI patients was determined. A higher proportion of anosmic MCI and AD cases were concurrent with the ApoE epsilon4 allele. In summary, dysmetabolism of amyloid was concurrent with migration and proliferation impairment of patient-derived stem cells.

25041840|t|Downregulation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in curcumin-induced autophagy in APP/PS1 double transgenic mice.
25041840|a|Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation pathway, which is essential for cell survival, proliferation, differentiation and homeostasis. It is well known that beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregation is one of key characteristics for Alzheimer's disease (AD), which triggers a complex pathological cascade, leading to neurodegeneration. Recent studies have shown that Abeta peptide is generated from amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) during autophagic turnover of APP-rich organelles by autophagy. Abeta generation during normal autophagy is subsequently degraded by lysosomes. Curcumin, a nature plant extraction, has been reported to inhibit the generation and deposition of Abeta; however, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood yet. In the present study, we reported that curcumin treatment not only attenuated cognitive impairment detected by Morris water maze test, but also inhibited the generation of Abeta investigated by immunohistochemistry in APP/PS1 double transgenic AD mice. Moreover, curcumin induced autophagy in the mice, evidenced by LC3 immunofluorescence analysis and western blot assays on LC3. Furthermore, we found that curcumin significantly decreased the expression of Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase (PI3K), phosphorylated Akt and rapamycin (mTOR) at protein levels, respectively. Taken together, our data suggests that curcumin inhibits Abeta generation and induces of autophagy by downregulating PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, and further shows a neuroprotective effect. Meanwhile curcumin might be a candidate neuroprotective agent for AD patients treatment by inducing autophagy.

Amyloid-beta (Abeta) is a constituent of AMD drusen and promotes the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome which facilitates the production of cytokines. We investigated the role of transcription factor NF-kappaB in the activation of inflammasome in the RPE and the effect of vinpocetine, a dietary supplement with inhibitory effect on NF-kappaBeta. ARPE19/NF-kappaB-luciferase reporter cells treated with Abeta demonstrated enhanced NF-kappaB activation that was significantly suppressed by vinpocetine. Intraperitoneal injection of vinpocetine (15 mg/kg) inhibited NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and reduced the expression and activation of NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-1beta, IL-18, and TNF-alpha in the RPE of adult rats that received intraocular Alphabeta, as measured by retinal immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Cytokine level in the vitreous was assayed using multiplex suspension arrays and revealed significantly lower concentration of MIP-3alpha, IL-6, IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-18, and TNF-alpha in vinpocetine treated animals. These results suggest that the NF-kappaB pathway is activated by Abeta in the RPE and signals the priming of NLRP3 inflammasome and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including the inflammasome substrates IL-1beta and IL-18. NF-kappaB inhibition may be an effective approach to stem the chronic inflammatory milieu that underlies the development of AMD. Vinpocetine is a potentially useful anti-inflammatory agent that is well-tolerated in long term use.

25042050|t|A brief overview of amyloids and Alzheimer's disease.
25042050|a|Amyloid fibrils are self-assembled fibrous protein aggregates that are associated with a number of presently incurable diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Millions of people worldwide suffer from amyloid diseases. This review summarizes the unique cross-beta structure of amyloid fibrils, morphological variations, the kinetics of amyloid fibril formation, and the cytotoxic effects of these fibrils and oligomers. Alzheimer's disease is also explored as an example of an amyloid disease to show the various approaches to treat these amyloid diseases. Finally, this review investigates the nanotechnological and biological applications of amyloid fibrils; as well as a summary of the typical biological pathways involved in the disposal of amyloid fibrils and their precursors.

25043039|t|Three-dimensional structure of human gamma-secretase.
25043039|a|The gamma-secretase complex, comprising presenilin 1 (PS1), PEN-2, APH-1 and nicastrin, is a membrane-embedded protease that controls a number of important cellular functions through substrate cleavage. Aberrant cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) results in aggregation of amyloid-beta, which accumulates in the brain and consequently causes Alzheimer's disease. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of an intact human gamma-secretase complex at 4.5 A resolution, determined by cryo-electron-microscopy single-particle analysis. The gamma-secretase complex comprises a horseshoe-shaped transmembrane domain, which contains 19 transmembrane segments (TMs), and a large extracellular domain (ECD) from nicastrin, which sits immediately above the hollow space formed by the TM horseshoe. Intriguingly, nicastrin ECD is structurally similar to a large family of peptidases exemplified by the glutamate carboxypeptidase PSMA. This structure serves as an important basis for understanding the functional mechanisms of the gamma-secretase complex.

25043464|t|PLXNA4 is associated with Alzheimer disease and modulates tau phosphorylation.
25043464|a|OBJECTIVE: Much of the genetic basis for Alzheimer disease (AD) is unexplained. We sought to identify novel AD loci using a unique family-based approach that can detect robust associations with infrequent variants (minor allele frequency < 0.10). METHODS: We conducted a genome-wide association study in the Framingham Heart Study (discovery) and NIA-LOAD (National Institute on Aging-Late-Onset Alzheimer Disease) Study (replication) family-based cohorts using an approach that accounts for family structure and calculates a risk score for AD as the outcome. Links between the most promising gene candidate and AD pathogenesis were explored in silico as well as experimentally in cell-based models and in human brain. RESULTS: Genome-wide significant association was identified with a PLXNA4 single nucleotide polymorphism (rs277470) located in a region encoding the semaphorin-3A (SEMA3A) binding domain (meta-analysis p value [meta-P] = 4.1 x 10(-8) ). A test for association with the entire region was also significant (meta-P = 3.2 x 10(-4) ). Transfection of SH-SY5Y cells or primary rat neurons with full-length PLXNA4 (TS1) increased tau phosphorylation with stimulated by SEMA3A. The opposite effect was observed when cells were transfected with shorter isoforms (TS2 and TS3). However, transfection of any isoform into HEK293 cells stably expressing amyloid beta (Abeta) precursor protein (APP) did not result in differential effects on APP processing or Abeta production. Late stage AD cases (n = 9) compared to controls (n = 5) had 1.9-fold increased expression of TS1 in cortical brain tissue (p = 1.6 x 10(-4) ). Expression of TS1 was significantly correlated with the Clinical Dementia Rating score (rho = 0.75, p = 2.2 x 10(-4) ), plaque density (rho = 0.56, p = 0.01), and Braak stage (rho = 0.54, p = 0.02). INTERPRETATION: Our results indicate that PLXNA4 has a role in AD pathogenesis through isoform-specific effects on tau phosphorylation.

25043908|t|Insulin resistance predicts brain amyloid deposition in late middle-aged adults.
25043908|a|BACKGROUND: Insulin resistance (IR) increases Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. IR is related to greater amyloid burden post-mortem and increased deposition within areas affected by early AD. No studies have examined if IR is associated with an in vivo index of amyloid in the human brain in late middle-aged participants at risk for AD. METHODS: Asymptomatic, late middle-aged adults (N = 186) from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention underwent [C-11]Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography. The cross-sectional design tested the interaction between insulin resistance and glycemic status on PiB distribution volume ratio in three regions of interest (frontal, parietal, and temporal). RESULTS: In participants with normoglycemia but not hyperglycemia, higher insulin resistance corresponded to higher PiB uptake in frontal and temporal areas, reflecting increased amyloid deposition. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first human study to demonstrate that insulin resistance may contribute to amyloid deposition in brain regions affected by AD.

25044076|t|Lamotrigine attenuates deficits in synaptic plasticity and accumulation of amyloid plaques in APP/PS1 transgenic mice.
25044076|a|Hyperactivity and its compensatory mechanisms may causally contribute to synaptic and cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Blocking the overexcitation of the neural network, with levetiracetam (LEV), a sodium channel blocker applied in the treatment of epilepsy, prevented synaptic and cognitive deficits in human amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice. This study has brought the potential use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in AD therapy. We showed that the chronic treatment with lamotrigine (LTG), a broad-spectrum AED, suppressed abnormal spike activity, prevented the loss of spines, synaptophysin immunoreactivity, and neurons, and thus attenuated the deficits in synaptic plasticity and learning and memory in APP and presenilin 1 (PS1) mice, which express human mutant APP and PS1. In contrast with LEV, which failed to reduce the generation of amyloid beta, the chronic LTG treatment reduced the cleavage of APP by beta-secretase and thus the numbers and the size of amyloid plaques in the brains of APP and PS1 mice. Moreover, the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic growth factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) were enhanced in the brains of APP and PS1 mice by the chronic LTG treatment. Therefore, these observations demonstrate that LTG attenuates AD pathology through multiple mechanisms, including modulation of abnormal network activity, reduction of the generation of amyloid beta and upregulation of BDNF and NGF.

25046994|t|Disease modifying effect of chronic oral treatment with a neurotrophic peptidergic compound in a triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
25046994|a|Besides the presence of amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity are markedly impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD) possibly contributing to cognitive impairment. In this context, neurotrophic factors serve as a promising therapeutic approach via utilization of regenerative capacity of brain to shift the balance from neurodegeneration to neural regeneration. However, besides more conventional "bystander" effect, to what extent can neurotrophic compounds affect underlying AD pathology remains questionable. Here we investigated the effect of chronic oral treatment with a ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) derived peptidergic compound, P021 (Ac-DGGL(A)G-NH2), on disease pathology both at moderate and severe stages in a transgenic mouse model of AD. 3xTg-AD and wild type female mice were treated for 12months with P021 or vehicle diet starting at 9-10months of age. A significant reduction in abnormal hyperphosphorylation and accumulation of tau at known major AD neurofibrillary pathology associated sites was observed. The effect of P021 on Abeta pathology was limited to a significant decrease in soluble Abeta levels and a trend towards reduction in Abeta plaque load in CA1 region of hippocampus, consistent with reduction in Abeta generation and not clearance. This disease modifying effect was probably via increased brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression mediated decrease in glycogen synthase kinase-3-beta (GSK3beta) activity we found in P021 treated 3xTg-AD mice. P021 treatment also rescued deficits in cognition, neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity in 3xTg-AD mice. These findings demonstrate the potential of the neurotrophic peptide mimetic as a disease modifying therapy for AD.

We quantified AbetaNpE3-42, AbetaNpE3-40, Abeta1-42, and Abeta1-40 concentrations in soluble (nonfibrillar) and insoluble (fibrillar) pools in PCC from subjects with an antemortem clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment, or mild-moderate AD. In clinical AD, increased PCC concentrations of Abeta were observed for all Abeta forms in the insoluble pool but only for Abeta1-42 in the soluble pool. Lower Mini-Mental State Exam and episodic memory scores correlated most strongly with higher concentrations of soluble and insoluble Abeta1-42. Greater neuropathology severity by Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease and National Institute on Aging-Reagan pathologic criteria was associated with higher concentrations of all measured Abeta forms, except soluble AbetaNpE3-40. Low concentrations of soluble pyroglutamate Abeta across clinical groups likely reflect its rapid sequestration into plaques, thus, the conversion to fibrillar Abeta may be a therapeutic target.

25048578|t|Amyloid burden, cerebrovascular disease, brain atrophy, and cognition in cognitively impaired patients.
25048578|a|BACKGROUND: We investigated the independent effects of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) pathologies on brain structural changes and cognition. METHODS: Amyloid burden (Pittsburgh compound B [PiB] retention ratio), CVD markers (volume of white matter hyperintensities [WMH] and number of lacunae), and structural changes (cortical thickness and hippocampal shape) were measured in 251 cognitively impaired patients. Path analyses were utilized to assess the effects of these markers on cognition. RESULTS: PiB retention ratio was associated with hippocampal atrophy, which was associated with memory impairment. WMH were associated with frontal thinning, which was associated with executive and memory dysfunctions. PiB retention ratio and lacunae were also associated with memory and executive dysfunction without the mediation of hippocampal or frontal atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the impacts of AD and CVD pathologies on cognition are mediated by specific brain regions.

25048970|t|Oxidized LDL lipids increase beta-amyloid production by SH-SY5Y cells through glutathione depletion and lipid raft formation.
25048970|a|Elevated total cholesterol in midlife has been associated with increased risk of dementia in later life. We have previously shown that low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is more oxidized in the plasma of dementia patients, although total cholesterol levels are not different from those of age-matched controls. beta-Amyloid (Abeta) peptide, which accumulates in Alzheimer disease (AD), arises from the initial cleavage of amyloid precursor protein by beta-secretase-1 (BACE1). BACE1 activity is regulated by membrane lipids and raft formation. Given the evidence for altered lipid metabolism in AD, we have investigated a mechanism for enhanced Abeta production by SH-SY5Y neuronal-like cells exposed to oxidized LDL (oxLDL). The viability of SH-SY5Y cells exposed to 4mug oxLDL and 25microM 27-hydroxycholesterol (27OH-C) was decreased significantly. Lipids, but not proteins, extracted from oxLDL were more cytotoxic than oxLDL. In parallel, the ratio of reduced glutathione (GSH) to oxidized glutathione was decreased at sublethal concentrations of lipids extracted from native and oxLDL. GSH loss was associated with an increase in acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) activity and lipid raft formation, which could be inhibited by the ASMase inhibitor desipramine. 27OH-C and total lipids from LDL and oxLDL independently increased Abeta production by SH-SY5Y cells, and Abeta accumulation could be inhibited by desipramine and by N-acetylcysteine. These data suggest a mechanism whereby oxLDL lipids and 27OH-C can drive Abeta production by GSH depletion, ASMase-driven membrane remodeling, and BACE1 activation in neuronal cells.

25050788|t|Assembly of amyloid beta peptides in the presence of fibril seeds: one-pot coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations.
25050788|a|The identification of a secondary nucleation pathway in the early aggregation of amyloid peptides suggests that the generation of toxic oligomers involves both monomers and preformed fibril seeds. To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism, a set of one-pot coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations was performed to investigate the self-assembly of amyloid beta peptides in the presence of fibril seeds. It was observed that fibril seeds alone randomly assemble into an elongated protofibril, whereas monomers alone form an elongated globular oligomer with various morphologies. In the mixture of monomers and fibril seeds, both the self-assembly of monomers into small oligomers and the association of monomers and oligomers on the surface of fibril seeds are primarily driven by hydrophobic interactions. The cooperativity of conformational selection and competition leads to different binding propensity of two hydrophobic surfaces of fibril seeds. The molecular architecture of the final aggregate shows that the fibril seeds establish the elongated framework, and oligomers cover them. Oligomers exposed to the solvent are less compact and unstable and can be disassociated from the fibril seeds, providing an origin for oligomers generated from the secondary nucleation pathway.

25050879|t|Novel quinazoline-urea analogues as modulators for Abeta-induced mitochondrial dysfunction: design, synthesis, and molecular docking study.
25050879|a|A novel series of twenty-six quinazoline-urea derivatives was designed and synthesized. Their blocking activities against beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) induced mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening were evaluated by JC-1 assay which measured the change of mitochondrial membrane potential. Seven compounds showed better inhibitory activities than the standard Cyclosporin A (CsA). The most active analogues were tested by MTT assay to evaluate their toxicity on the cellular survival; they revealed excellent cellular viability. To explain the difference in inhibitory activity, molecular docking study using (GOLD) program was performed for selected sets of the most active and inactive compounds on cyclophilin D (CypD) receptor as a major component of mPTP. Moreover, ADME profiling, in silico toxicity, drug-likeness, and drug-score studies were discussed. From these results, we report compound 31 as the most active nonpeptidyl mPTP blocker possessing quinazoline-urea scaffold; 2 folds of CsA activity, which would constitute a new direction for the design of novel mPTP modulators.

25051063|t|Disaggregation ability of different chelating molecules on copper ion-triggered amyloid fibers.
25051063|a|Dysfunctional interaction of amyloid-beta (Abeta) with excess metal ions is proved to be related to the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using metal-binding compounds to reverse metal-triggered Abeta aggregation has become one of the potential therapies for AD. In this study, the ability of a carboxylic acid gemini surfactant (SDUC), a widely used metal chelator (EDTA), and an antifungal drug clioquinol (CQ) in reversing the Cu(2+)-triggered Abeta(1-40) fibers have been systematically studied by using turbidity essay, BCA essay, atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and isothermal titration microcalorimetry. The results show that the binding affinity of Cu(2+) with CQ, SDUC, and EDTA is in the order of CQ > EDTA > SDUC, while the disaggregation ability to Cu(2+)-triggered Abeta(1-40) fibers is in the order of CQ > SDUC > EDTA. Therefore, the disaggregation ability of chelators to the Abeta(1-40) fibers does not only depend on the binding affinity of the chelators with Cu(2+). Strong self-assembly ability of SDUC and pi-pi interaction of the conjugate group of CQ also contributes toward the disaggregation of the Cu(2+)-triggered Abeta(1-40) fibers and result in the formation of mixed small aggregates.

25052555|t|Cerebral vascular leak in a mouse model of amyloid neuropathology.
25052555|a|In Alzheimer's disease (AD), there is increasing evidence of blood-brain barrier (BBB) compromise, usually observed as 'microbleeds' correlated with amyloid plaque deposition and apoE-e4 status, raising the possibility of nanotherapeutic delivery. Molecular probes have been used to study neurovascular leak, but this approach does not adequately estimate vascular permeability of nanoparticles. We therefore characterized cerebrovascular leaks in live APP+ transgenic animals using a long circulating ~100 nm nanoparticle computed tomography (CT) contrast agent probe. Active leaks fell into four categories: (1) around the dorsomedial cerebellar artery (DMCA), (2) around other major vessels, (3) nodular leaks in the cerebral cortex, and (4) diffuse leaks. Cortical leaks were uniformly more frequent in the transgenic animals than in age-matched controls. Leaks around vessels other than the DMCA were more frequent in older transgenics compared with younger ones. All other leaks were equally prevalent across genotypes independent of age. Ten days after injection, 4 to 5 mug of the dose was estimated to be present in the brain, roughly a half of which was in locations other than the leaky choroid plexus, and associated with amyloid deposition in older animals. These results suggest that amyloid deposition and age increase delivery of nanoparticle-borne reagents to the brain, in therapeutically relevant amounts.

25052558|t|Juvenile traumatic brain injury induces long-term perivascular matrix changes alongside amyloid-beta accumulation.
25052558|a|In our juvenile traumatic brain injury (jTBI) model, emergence of cognitive dysfunctions was observed up to 6 months after trauma. Here we hypothesize that early brain injury induces changes in the neurovascular unit (NVU) that would be associated with amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation. We investigated NVU changes for up to 6 months in a rat jTBI model, with a focus on the efflux protein P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and on the basement membrane proteins perlecan and fibronectin, all known to be involved in Abeta clearance. Rodent-Abeta staining is present and increased after jTBI around cerebral blood microvessels, and the diameter of those is decreased by 25% and 34% at 2 and 6 months, respectively, without significant angiogenesis. P-glycoprotein staining in endothelium is decreased by 22% and parallels an increase of perlecan and fibronectin staining around cerebral blood vessels. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that the emergence of long-term behavioral dysfunctions observed in rodent jTBI may be related to endothelial remodeling at the blood-brain barrier alongside vascular dysfunction and altered Abeta trafficking. This study shows that it is important to consider jTBI as a vascular disorder with long-term consequences on cognitive functions.

25052843|t|Intromitochondrial IkappaB/NF-kappaB signaling pathway is involved in amyloid beta peptide-induced mitochondrial dysfunction.
25052843|a|Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta)-induced neuronal toxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the underlying mechanism (s) of Abeta-induced mitochondrial dysfunction is still not fully understood. There is evidence that nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) is involved in Abeta-induced neurotoxicity and is present in mitochondria. Using HT22 murine hippocampal neuronal cells and isolated mitochondria, the present study investigated whether intramitochondrial inhibitor of NF-kappaB (IkappaB)/NF-kappaB signaling pathway was involved in mitochondrial dysfunction induced by Abeta. It was found that Abeta impaired mitochondrial function through a NF-kappaB-dependent signaling pathway. Intramitochondrial IkappaBalpha/NF-kappaB pathway, induced by Abeta, decreased the expression of cytochrome c oxidase subunit (COXIII) and inhibited COX activity. These results provide new insights into the mechanism underlying the neurotoxic effect of Abeta and open up new therapeutic perspectives for AD.

25053581|t|Differential regulation of amyloid precursor protein sorting with pathological mutations results in a distinct effect on amyloid-beta production.
25053581|a|The deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide, which is generated from amyloid precursor protein (APP), is the pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Three APP familial AD mutations (D678H, D678N, and H677R) located at the sixth and seventh amino acid of Abeta have distinct effect on Abeta aggregation, but their influence on the physiological and pathological roles of APP remain unclear. We found that the D678H mutation strongly enhances amyloidogenic cleavage of APP, thus increasing the production of Abeta. This enhancement of amyloidogenic cleavage is likely because of the acceleration of APPD678H sorting into the endosomal-lysosomal pathway. In contrast, the APPD678N and APPH677R mutants do not cause the same effects. Therefore, this study indicates a regulatory role of D678H in APP sorting and processing, and provides genetic evidence for the importance of APP sorting in AD pathogenesis. The internalization of amyloid precursor protein (APP) increases its opportunity to be processed by beta-secretase and to produce Amyloid-beta (Abeta) that causes Alzheimer's disease (AD). We report a pathogenic APPD678H mutant that enhances APP internalization into the endosomal-lysosomal pathway and thus promotes the beta-secretase cleavage and Abeta production. This study provides genetic evidence for the importance of APP sorting in AD pathogenesis.

25054282|t|Association of lifetime intellectual enrichment with cognitive decline in the older population.
25054282|a|IMPORTANCE: Intellectual lifestyle enrichment throughout life is increasingly viewed as a protective strategy against commonly observed cognitive decline in the older population. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association of lifetime intellectual enrichment with baseline cognitive performance and rate of cognitive decline in an older population without dementia and to estimate the years of protection provided against cognitive impairment by these factors. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective analysis of individuals enrolled from October 1, 2004, and in 2008 and 2009 in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, a longitudinal, population-based study of cognitive aging in Olmsted County, Minnesota. We studied 1995 individuals without dementia (1718 cognitively normal individuals and 277 individuals with mild cognitive impairment) who completed intellectual lifestyle enrichment measures at baseline and underwent at least 1 follow-up visit. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We studied the effect of lifetime intellectual enrichment by separating the variables into 2 nonoverlapping principal components: education/occupation score and mid/late-life cognitive activity based on self-report questionnaires. A global cognitive z score served as the summary cognition measure. Linear mixed-effects models were used to investigate the associations of demographic and intellectual enrichment measures with global cognitive z score trajectories. RESULTS: Baseline cognitive performance was lower in older individuals; individuals with lower education/occupation score, lower mid/late-life cognitive activity, and APOE genotype; and men (P < .001). The interaction between the 2 intellectual enrichment measures was significant (P < .03) such that the beneficial effect of mid/late-life cognitive activity on baseline cognitive performance was reduced with increasing education/occupation score. Only baseline age, mid/late-life cognitive activity, and APOE4 genotype were significantly associated with longitudinal change in cognitive performance from baseline (P < .05). For APOE4 carriers with high lifetime intellectual enrichment (75th percentile of education/occupation score and midlife to late-life cognitive activity), the onset of cognitive impairment was approximately 8.7 years later compared with low lifetime intellectual enrichment (25th percentile of education/occupation score and mid/late-life cognitive activity). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Higher education/occupation scores were associated with higher levels of cognition. Higher levels of mid/late-life cognitive activity were also associated with higher levels of cognition, but the slope of this association slightly increased over time. Lifetime intellectual enrichment might delay the onset of cognitive impairment and be used as a successful preventive intervention to reduce the impending dementia epidemic.

25056787|t|Mercury-induced amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation in the brain is mediated by disruption of Abeta transport.
25056787|a|According to a recent study, mercury (Hg) exposure contributes to Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the underlying mechanisms are not understood. This study investigated the effect of methylmercury (MeHg) treatment on the generation, degradation, and transport of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) in the brain. Wistar rats were administered MeHg by gavage (0, 20, 200, and 2,000 mug Hg/kg/day) for 4 weeks. The total Hg in the blood and brain regions was measured, and the levels of Abeta42 in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and brain regions were estimated. The expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP), beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), and neprilysin (NEP) in the brain regions was determined, in addition to the expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) in the brain capillary endothelium (BCE). Finally, the amount of soluble low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (sLRP) in the plasma was determined. Abeta42 levels were decreased in the CSF of the 2,000 mug Hg/kg/day group compared with controls, and Abeta42 levels increased in the hippocampus (HC) in a dose-dependent manner. MeHg decreased LRP1 expression but increased RAGE levels in BCE. sLRP levels were decreased in the plasma of the MeHg-treated rats. They were positively correlated with CSF Abeta42 and negatively correlated with Abeta42 and Hg levels in HC. These results imply that MeHg reduces the transportation of Abeta, thereby resulting in the accumulation of the protein in the HC. Plasma sLRP levels may be an early biomarker of Hg-induced Abeta accumulation in the brain.

25058309|t|A systematic review of amyloid-beta peptides as putative mediators of the association between affective disorders and Alzheimer s disease.
25058309|a|BACKGROUND: Affective disorders are associated with an increased occurrence of cognitive deficits and have been linked to cognitive impairment and Alzheimer s disease. The putative molecular mechanisms involved in these associations are however not clear. The aim of this systematic review was to explore clinically founded evidence for amyloid-beta peptides in cerebrospinal fluid and blood as putative biomarkers for affective disorders. METHOD: Systematic searches in Embase and PubMed databases yielded 23 eligible, observational studies. RESULTS: Despite inconsistencies that were partly ascribed to the application of different assay formats, study results indicate a potentially altered amyloid-beta metabolism in affective disorder. LIMITATIONS: Since most studies used a cross-sectional design, causality is difficult to establish. Moreover, methodological rigor of included studies varied and several studies were limited by very low sample numbers. Finally, different assays for amyloid-beta were utilized in the different studies, thus hampering comparisons. CONCLUSION: To unravel possible risk relations and causalities between affective disorder and Alzheimer s disease and to determine how amyloid-beta concentrations change over time and are associated with cognition as well as affective symptomatology, future research should include prospective, longitudinal studies, implemented in large study populations, where peripheral and central amyloid-beta ratios are quantified concomitantly and continuously across various affective phases. Also, to enable inter-survey comparisons, the use of standardized pre-analytical/analytical procedures is crucial.

25058565|t|Haptoglobin interacts with apolipoprotein E and beta-amyloid and influences their crosstalk.
25058565|a|Beta-amyloid accumulation in brain is a driving force for Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) represents a critical player in beta-amyloid homeostasis, but its role in disease progression is controversial. We previously reported that the acute-phase protein haptoglobin binds ApoE and impairs its function in cholesterol homeostasis. The major aims of this study were to characterize the binding of haptoglobin to beta-amyloid, and to evaluate whether haptoglobin affects ApoE binding to beta-amyloid. Haptoglobin is here reported to form a complex with beta-amyloid as shown by immunoblotting experiments with purified proteins, or by its immunoprecipitation in brain tissues from patients with Alzheimer's disease. The interaction between ApoE and beta-amyloid was previously shown to be crucial for limiting beta-amyloid neurotoxicity and for promoting its clearance. We demonstrate that haptoglobin, rather than impairing ApoE binding to beta-amyloid, promotes to a different extent the formation of the complex between beta-amyloid and ApoE2 or ApoE3 or ApoE4. Our data suggest that haptoglobin and ApoE functions in brain should be evaluated taking into account their mutual interaction with beta-amyloid. Hence, the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease might not only be linked to the different ApoE isoforms, but also rely on the level of critical ligands, such as haptoglobin.

25058791|t|Histone deacetylase mediates the decrease in drebrin cluster density induced by amyloid beta oligomers.
25058791|a|Dendritic spine defects are found in a number of cognitive disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid beta (Abeta) toxicity is mediated not only by the fibrillar form of the protein, but also by the soluble oligomers (Abeta-derived diffusible ligands, ADDLs). Drebrin is an actin-binding protein that is located at mature dendritic spines. Because drebrin expression is decreased in AD brains and in cultured neurons exposed to Abeta, it is thought that drebrin is closely associated with cognitive functions. Recent studies show that histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity is elevated in the AD mouse model, and that memory impairments in these animals can be ameliorated by HDAC inhibitors. In addition, spine loss and memory impairment in HDAC2 over-expressing mice are ameliorated by chronic HDAC inhibitor treatment. Therefore, we hypothesized that the regulation of histone acetylation/deacetylation is critical to synaptic functioning. In this study, we examined the relationship between HDAC activity and synaptic defects induced by ADDLs using an HDAC inhibitor, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA). We show that ADDLs reduce the cluster density of drebrin along dendrites without reducing drebrin expression. SAHA markedly increased the acetylation of histone proteins, and it simultaneously attenuated the ADDL-induced decrease in drebrin cluster density. In comparison, SAHA treatment did not affect the density of drebrin clusters or dendritic protrusions in control neurons. Therefore, SAHA likely inhibits ADDL-induced drebrin loss from dendritic spines by stabilizing drebrin in these structures, rather than by increasing drebrin clusters or dendritic protrusions. Taken together, our findings suggest that HDAC is involved in ADDL-induced synaptic defects, and that the regulation of histone acetylation plays an important role in modulating actin cytoskeletal dynamics in dendritic spines under cellular stress conditions, such as ADDL exposure.

Several types of mutations within the Abeta sequence have been identified, and the 'Arctic' mutation (E22G) has a purely cognitive phenotype typical of AD. Previous studies have shown that the primary result of the 'Arctic' mutation is increased formation of Abeta protofibrils. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this effect remains unknown. Abeta42 binds to a neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit, neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-7 (CHRNA7), with high affinity and, thus, may be involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Therefore, to clarify the molecular mechanism of Arctic mutation-mediated FAD, we focused on CHRNA7 as a target molecule of Arctic Abeta. We performed an in vitro binding assay using purified CHRNA7 and synthetic Arctic Abeta40, and demonstrated that Arctic Abeta40 specifically bound to CHRNA7. The aggregation of Arctic Abeta40 was enhanced with the addition of CHRNA7. Furthermore, the function of CHRNA7 was detected by measuring Ca(2+) flux and phospho-p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) activation. Our results indicated that Arctic Abeta40 aggregation was enhanced by the addition of CHRNA7, which destabilized the function of CHRNA7 via inhibition of Ca(2+) responses and activation of ERK1/2. These findings indicate that Arctic Abeta mutation may be involved in the mechanism underlying FAD. This mechanism may involve binding and aggregation, leading to the inhibition of CHRNA7 functions.

25060965|t|The protective effect of Borago Officinalis extract on amyloid beta (25-35)-induced long term potentiation disruption in the dentate gyrus of male rats.
25060965|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) begins with impairment in synaptic functions before developing into later neurodegeneration and neural loss. In the present study we have examined the protective effects of Borago Officinalis (borage) extract on amyloid beta (Abeta)--Induced long term potentiation (LTP) disruption in hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). Wistar male rats received intrahippocampal (IHP) injection of the Abeta (25-35) and borage extract throughout gestation (100 mg/kg). LTP in perforant path- DG synapses was assessed using electrophysiology method and field excitatory post- synaptic potential (fEPSP) slope and population spike (PS) amplitude were measured by 400 Hz tetanization. Finally, the total thiol content of hippocampus was measured using colorimetric reaction based on the Ellman's method. The results showed that Abeta (25-35) significantly decreased fEPSP slope and SP amplitude comparing with the control and sham group, whereas borage extract administration increased these parameters compared to the Abeta group. Abeta induced a remarkable decrease in total thiol content of hippocampus and borage prevented the decrease of the hippocampal total sulfhydryl (SH) groups. This data suggest that Abeta (25-35) can effectively inhibit LTP in the granular cells of the DG in hippocampus, and borage supplementation reverse the synaptic plasticity in DG following Abeta treatment and that borage consumption may lead to an improvement of AD-induced cognitive dysfunction.

25062433|t|Chiral metallohelical complexes enantioselectively target amyloid beta for treating Alzheimer's disease.
25062433|a|Stereochemistry is a very important issue for the pharmaceutical industry and can determine drug efficacy. The design and synthesis of small molecules, especially chiral molecules, which selectively target and inhibit amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregation, represent valid therapeutic strategies for treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Herein we report that two triple-helical dinuclear metallosupramolecular complexes can act as a novel class of chiral amyloid-beta inhibitors. Through targeting alpha/beta-discordant stretches at the early steps of aggregation, these metal complexes can enantioselectively inhibit Abeta aggregation, which is demonstrated using fluorescent living cell-based screening and multiple biophysical and biochemical approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of enantioselective inhibition of Abeta aggregation. Intriguingly, as a promising candidate for AD treatment, the chiral metal complex can cross the blood-brain barrier and have superoxide dismutase activity. It is well-known that chiral discrimination is important for understanding chiral drug action. Generally, one enantiomer is pharmaceutically active while the other is inactive or exerts severe side effects. Chiral discrimination should be important for AD treatment. Our work provides new insights into chiral inhibition of Abeta aggregation and opens a new avenue for design and screening of chiral agents as Abeta inhibitors against AD.

25063945|t|Novel 18F-labeled dibenzylideneacetone derivatives as potential positron emission tomography probes for in vivo imaging of beta-amyloid plaques.
25063945|a|A series of dibenzylideneacetones were synthesized and evaluated as imaging probes for beta-amyloid plaques. They displayed high binding affinity to Abeta(1-42) aggregates (K(i) = 6.4 for 8, K(i) = 3.0 for 9), and the high binding were confirmed by in vitro autoradiography with AD human and transgenic mouse brain sections. Two of them were selected for (18)F-labeling directly on the benzene ring. In biodistribution experiments, [(18)F]8 and [(18)F]9 displayed high initial uptakes (9.29 +- 0.41 and 5.38 +- 0.68% ID/g) and rapid washouts from the normal brain (brain(2 min)/brain(60 min) ratios of 21.6 and 13.4). These preliminary results suggest that [(18)F]8 and [(18)F]9 may be used as potential PET imaging agents for the detection of Abeta plaques in the brain.

25064539|t|Optimisation and standardisation of functional immune assays for striped catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus) to compare their immune response to live and heat killed Aeromonas hydrophila as models of infection and vaccination.
25064539|a|Aquaculture production of Pangasianodon hypophthalmus is growing rapidly in South East Asia, especially in Vietnam. As it is a relatively new aquaculture species there are few reports evaluating its immune response to pathogens. Thus, functional assays for P. hypophthalmus were optimised to evaluate both innate and adaptive immune responses, and were then used to examine immune response following stimulation with live and heat-killed Aeromonas hydrophila. These were used as models of infection and vaccination, respectively. Four treatment groups were used, including a control group, a group injected intraperitonally (IP) with adjuvant only, a group injected with heat-killed A. hydrophila (1 x 10(9) cfu ml(-1) mixed with adjuvant), and a group injected with a subclinical dose of live A. hydrophila. Samples were collected at 0, 1, 3, 7, 14 and 21 days post-injection (d.p.i.) to assess their immune response. The results indicated that challenge with live or dead bacteria stimulated the immune response in P. hypophthalmus significantly above the levels observed in control groups with respect to specific antibody titre, plasma lysozyme and peroxidase activity, and phagocytosis by head kidney macrophages at 7 or/and 14 d.p.i. At 21 d.p.i., total and specific antibody (IgM) levels and plasma lysozyme activity in fish injected with either live or dead A. hydrophila were significantly different to the control groups. Differential immune responses were observed between fish injected with either live or dead bacteria, with live A. hydrophila significantly stimulating an increase in WBC counts and plasma peroxidase activity at 3 d.p.i., with the greatest increase in WBC counts noted at 21 d.p.i. and in phagocytosis at 14 d.p.i. By 21 d.p.i. only the macrophages from fish injected with dead A. hydrophila showed significantly stimulation in their respiratory burst activity. This study provides basic information on the immune response in pangasius catfish that can be useful in the health control of this species.

25066110|t|Implicating the role of lycopene in restoration of mitochondrial enzymes and BDNF levels in beta-amyloid induced Alzheimer s disease.
25066110|a|Lycopene has attracted significant research interest due to its beneficial therapeutic effects, which include anti-oxidant, neuro-protective and anti-cancer effects, but the mechanisms of its beneficial action are not clear so far. The present study was carried out to elucidate the neuroprotective effect of lycopene against the beta-amyloid induced cognitive impairment and mitochondria oxidative damage in rats. beta-amyloid (beta-A1-42) was administered through intracerebroventricular (ICV) by using stereotaxic instrument in male Wistar rats. Lycopene (2.5 and 5mg/kg) was administrated for three weeks. Behavioral performances were conducted during the study. The rats were sacrificed on the 21st day following the last behavioral test and cytoplasmic fractions of hippocampus were prepared for the quantification of acetylcholinesterase, oxidative stress parameter, mitochondrial enzymes, and inflammatory mediator like TNF-alpha, Il-6 activities, caspase-3 and BDNF. ICV beta-A1-42 resulted in poor memory retention in Morris water maze and caused marked oxidative stress as indicated by significant increase in oxidative, mitochondria damage, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and Caspase-3 activity. We also found that beta-A1-42 induced animal altered BDNF level than control animals. Chronic administration of lycopene resulted in an improvement in memory retention, attenuation of mitochondrial-oxidative damage, reduced neuro-inflammation and restoration of BDNF level in beta-A1-42 treated rats. These studies indicated that lycopene helps to protect beta-A1-42 induced cognitive dysfunction and modulates amyloidogenesis.

25066125|t|Zinc binding directly regulates tau toxicity independent of tau hyperphosphorylation.
25066125|a|Tau hyperphosphorylation is thought to underlie tauopathy. Working in a Drosophila tauopathy model expressing a human Tau mutant (hTauR406W, or Tau(*)), we show that zinc contributes to the development of Tau toxicity through two independent actions: by increasing Tau phosphorylation and, more significantly, by directly binding to Tau. Elimination of zinc binding through amino acid substitution of Cys residues has a minimal effect on phosphorylation levels yet essentially eliminates Tau toxicity. The toxicity of the zinc-binding-deficient mutant Tau(*) (Tau(*)C2A) and overexpression of native Drosophila Tau, also lacking the corresponding zinc-binding Cys residues, are largely impervious to zinc concentration. Importantly, restoration of zinc-binding ability to Tau(*) by introduction of a zinc-binding residue (His) into the original Cys positions restores zinc-responsive toxicities in proportion to zinc-binding affinities. These results indicate zinc binding is a substantial contributor to tauopathy and have implications for therapy development.

25068693|t|A fibril-like assembly of oligomers of a peptide derived from beta-amyloid.
25068693|a|A macrocyclic beta-sheet peptide containing two nonapeptide segments based on Abeta(15-23) (QKLVFFAED) forms fibril-like assemblies of oligomers in the solid state. The X-ray crystallographic structure of macrocyclic beta-sheet peptide 3 was determined at 1.75 A resolution. The macrocycle forms hydrogen-bonded dimers, which further assemble along the fibril axis in a fashion resembling a herringbone pattern. The extended beta-sheet comprising the dimers is laminated against a second layer of dimers through hydrophobic interactions to form a fibril-like assembly that runs the length of the crystal lattice. The second layer is offset by one monomer subunit, so that the fibril-like assembly is composed of partially overlapping dimers, rather than discrete tetramers. In aqueous solution, macrocyclic beta-sheet 3 and homologues 4 and 5 form discrete tetramers, rather than extended fibril-like assemblies. The fibril-like assemblies of oligomers formed in the solid state by macrocyclic beta-sheet 3 represent a new mode of supramolecular assembly not previously observed for the amyloidogenic central region of Abeta. The structures observed at atomic resolution for this peptide model system may offer insights into the structures of oligomers and oligomer assemblies formed by full-length Abeta and may provide a window into the propagation and replication of amyloid oligomers.

25069482|t|Functional connectivity in autosomal dominant and late-onset Alzheimer disease.
25069482|a|IMPORTANCE: Autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease (ADAD) is caused by rare genetic mutations in 3 specific genes in contrast to late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD), which has a more polygenetic risk profile. OBJECTIVE: To assess the similarities and differences in functional connectivity changes owing to ADAD and LOAD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We analyzed functional connectivity in multiple brain resting state networks (RSNs) in a cross-sectional cohort of participants with ADAD (n = 79) and LOAD (n = 444), using resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging at multiple international academic sites. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: For both types of AD, we quantified and compared functional connectivity changes in RSNs as a function of dementia severity measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale. In ADAD, we qualitatively investigated functional connectivity changes with respect to estimated years from onset of symptoms within 5 RSNs. RESULTS: A decrease in functional connectivity with increasing Clinical Dementia Rating scores were similar for both LOAD and ADAD in multiple RSNs. Ordinal logistic regression models constructed in one type of Alzheimer disease accurately predicted clinical dementia rating scores in the other, further demonstrating the similarity of functional connectivity loss in each disease type. Among participants with ADAD, functional connectivity in multiple RSNs appeared qualitatively lower in asymptomatic mutation carriers near their anticipated age of symptom onset compared with asymptomatic mutation noncarriers. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging changes with progressing AD severity are similar between ADAD and LOAD. Resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging may be a useful end point for LOAD and ADAD therapy trials. Moreover, the disease process of ADAD may be an effective model for the LOAD disease process.

25073522|t|Is there a risk of prion-like disease transmission by Alzheimer- or Parkinson-associated protein particles?
25073522|a|The misfolding and aggregation of endogenous proteins in the central nervous system is a neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), as well as prion diseases. A molecular mechanism referred to as "nucleation-dependent aggregation" is thought to underlie this neuropathological phenomenon. According to this concept, disease-associated protein particles act as nuclei, or seeds, that recruit cellular proteins and incorporate them, in a misfolded form, into their growing aggregate structure. Experimental studies have shown that the aggregation of the AD-associated proteins amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau, and of the PD-associated protein alpha-synuclein, can be stimulated in laboratory animal models by intracerebral (i.c.) injection of inocula containing aggregated species of the respective proteins. This has raised the question of whether AD or PD can be transmitted, like certain human prion diseases, between individuals by self-propagating protein particles potentially present on medical instruments or in blood or blood products. While the i.c. injection of inocula containing AD- or PD-associated protein aggregates was found to cause neuronal damage and clinical abnormalities (e.g., motor impairments) in some animal models, none of the studies published so far provided evidence for a transmission of severe or even fatal disease. In addition, available epidemiological data do not indicate a transmissibility of AD or PD between humans. The findings published so far on the effects of experimentally transmitted AD- or PD-associated protein seeds do not suggest specific precautionary measures in the context of hemotherapy, but call for vigilance in transfusion medicine and other medical areas.

25076262|t|Self-assembly of stable oligomeric and fibrillar aggregates of Abeta peptides relevant to Alzheimer's disease: morphology dependent Cu/heme toxicity and inhibition of PROS generation.
25076262|a|Large and small aggregates of Abeta peptides, resembling the morphology and dimensions of fibrillar and oligomeric forms of Abeta respectively, relevant to Alzheimer's disease, are stabilized on electrodes using self-assembly. Both of these forms were found to bind redox active Cu and heme, resulting in active sites having distinctive biophysical properties. The reduced metal bound Abeta active sites of both the oligomeric and fibrillar forms of Abeta produce detrimental partially reduced oxygen species (PROS). While the larger aggregates of heme-Abeta produce more PROS in situ, the smaller aggregates of Cu-Abeta produce more PROS. 8-Hydroxy quinoline and methylene blue are inhibitors of Cu and heme bound Abeta respectively, and are shown to efficiently reduce PROS formation in the oligomeric forms. However, these inhibitors are ineffective in reducing the toxicities of the Cu and heme bound Abeta peptides in the fibrils, making them significantly more lethal than the smaller Abeta aggregates.

25077728|t|Effect of Endurance Cardiovascular Training Intensity on Erectile Dysfunction Severity in Men With Ischemic Heart Disease.
25077728|a|The protective effect of physical activity on arteries is not limited to coronary vessels, but extends to the whole arterial system, including arteries, in which endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerotic changes are one of the key factors affecting erectile dysfunction development. The objective of this study was to report whether the endurance training intensity and training-induced chronotropic response are linked with a change in erectile dysfunction intensity in men with ischemic heart disease. A total of 150 men treated for ischemic heart disease, who suffered from erectile dysfunction, were analyzed. The study group consisted of 115 patients who were subjected to a cardiac rehabilitation program. The control group consisted of 35 patients who were not subjected to any cardiac rehabilitation. An IIEF-5 (International Index of Erectile Function) questionnaire was used for determining erectile dysfunction before and after cardiac rehabilitation. Cardiac training intensity was objectified by parameters describing work of endurance training. The mean initial intensity of erectile dysfunction in the study group was 12.46 +- 6.01 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 11.35-13.57). Final erectile dysfunction intensity (EDI) assessed after the cardiac rehabilitation program in the study group was 14.35 +- 6.88 (95% CI = 13.08-15.62), and it was statistically significantly greater from initial EDI. Mean final training work was statistically significantly greater than mean initial training work. From among the parameters describing training work, none were related significantly to reduction of EDI. In conclusion, cardiac rehabilitation program-induced improvement in erection severity is not correlated with endurance training intensity. Chronotropic response during exercise may be used for initial assessment of change in cardiac rehabilitation program-induced erection severity.

25080588|t|Multiple factors contribute to the peripheral induction of cerebral beta-amyloidosis.
25080588|a|Deposition of aggregated amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide in brain is an early event and hallmark pathology of Alzheimer's disease and cerebral Abeta angiopathy. Experimental evidence supports the concept that Abeta multimers can act as seeds and structurally corrupt other Abeta peptides by a self-propagating mechanism. Here we compare the induction of cerebral beta-amyloidosis by intraperitoneal applications of Abeta-containing brain extracts in three Abeta-precursor protein (APP) transgenic mouse lines that differ in levels of transgene expression in brain and periphery (APP23 mice, APP23 mice lacking murine APP, and R1.40 mice). Results revealed that beta-amyloidosis induction, which could be blocked with an anti-Abeta antibody, was dependent on the amount of inoculated brain extract and on the level of APP/Abeta expression in the brain but not in the periphery. The induced Abeta deposits in brain occurred in a characteristic pattern consistent with the entry of Abeta seeds at multiple brain locations. Intraperitoneally injected Abeta could be detected in blood monocytes and some peripheral tissues (liver, spleen) up to 30 d after the injection but escaped histological and biochemical detection thereafter. These results suggest that intraperitoneally inoculated Abeta seeds are transported from the periphery to the brain in which corruptive templating of host Abeta occurs at multiple sites, most efficiently in regions with high availability of soluble Abeta.

25081412|t|Efficacy and safety studies of gantenerumab in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
25081412|a|Among active and passive anti-beta-amyloid (Abeta) immunotherapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD), bapineuzumab and solanezumab, two humanized monoclonal antibodies, failed to show significant clinical benefits in mild-to-moderate AD patients in large Phase III clinical trials. Another ongoing Phase III trial of solanezumab aims to confirm positive findings in mild AD patients. Gantenerumab is the first fully human anti-Abeta monoclonal antibody directed to both N-terminal and central regions of Abeta. A 6-month PET study in 16 AD patients showed that gantenerumab treatment dose-dependently reduced brain Abeta deposition, possibly stimulating microglial-mediated phagocytosis. Two ongoing Phase III trials of gantenerumab in patients with prodromal or mild dementia due to AD will determine if any reduction in brain Abeta levels will translate into clinical benefits. An ongoing secondary prevention trial of gantenerumab in presymptomatic subjects with genetic mutations for autosomal-dominant AD will verify the utility of anti-Abeta monoclonal antibodies as prevention therapy.

25082146|t|Strong inhibition of beta-amyloid peptide aggregation realized by two-steps evolved peptides.
25082146|a|Several decades of cumulated research evidence have proven that aggregation of beta-amyloid 42 (Abeta42) is the main cause of neuronal death in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, inhibition of Abeta42 aggregation holds great promise for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease. To this end, we used a systematic in vitro evolution including a paired peptide library method. We identified two peptides with high binding affinity (with Kd in the nm range) for Abeta42. Functionally, these peptides strongly inhibited the aggregation of Abeta42 as shown by the thioflavin T assay and atomic force microscopy. Moreover, these peptides rescued PC12 cells from the cytotoxic effect of aggregated Abeta42 in vitro. Our results suggest that these novel peptides may be potential therapeutic seeds for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

25083748|t|Insight into the inhibition effect of acidulated serum albumin on amyloid beta-protein fibrillogenesis and cytotoxicity.
25083748|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, and aggregation of amyloid beta-proteins (Abeta) into soluble oligomers and fibrils has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. Herein we developed acidulated serum albumin for the inhibition of Abeta42 fibrillogenesis. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was modified with diglycolic anhydride, leading to the coupling of 14.5 more negative charges (carboxyl groups) on average on each protein surface. The acidulated BSA (A-BSA) was characterized and confirmed to keep the tertiary structure and stability of BSA. Extensive biophysical and biological analyses showed that A-BSA significantly inhibited Abeta42 fibrillogenesis and mitigated amyloid cytotoxicity. As compared to the Abeta42-treated group (cell viability, 50%), the cell viability increased to 88% by the addition of equimolar A-BSA. The inhibitory effect was remarkably higher than that of BSA at the same concentration. On the basis of the experimental findings, a mechanistic model was proposed. The model considers that Abeta42 is bound to the A-BSA surface by hydrophobic interactions, but the widely distributed negative charges on the A-BSA surface give rise to electrostatic repulsions to the bound Abeta42 that is also negatively charged. The two well-balanced opposite forces make Abeta42 adopt extended conformations instead of the beta-sheet structure that is necessary for the on-pathway fibrillogenesis, even when the protein is released off the surface. Thus, A-BSA greatly slows down the fibrillation and changes the fibrillogenesis pathway, leading to the formation of less toxic aggregates. The findings and the mechanistic model offer new insights into the development of more potent inhibitors of Abeta fibrillogenesis and cytotoxicity.

25085784|t|Combined treatment of amyloid-beta1-42-stimulated bone marrow-derived dendritic cells plus splenocytes from young mice prevents the development of Alzheimer's disease in APPswe/PSENldE9 mice.
25085784|a|Anti-amyloid-beta (Abeta) immunotherapy is a potential therapeutic strategy to reduce amyloid plaques and amyloid-associated pathologies in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Immune senescence with aging has also played a crucial role in AD pathogenesis and influences the effect of anti-Abeta immunotherapy. In this study, a combined treatment of Abeta1-42-bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) with intraperitoneal injection of splenocytes from young mice was designed as a novel immunotherapy for AD in APPswe/PSEN1de9 transgenic mice models. The results showed that the combined treatment not only elevated the level of anti-Abeta antibodies but also reduced amyloid plaques in brain and finally ameliorated deterioration of spatial learning and memory in AD mice. Additionally, the results revealed an increase of CD68 positive microglial cells in the vicinity of amyloid plaques in the mouse brain, which was responsible for the enhanced phagocytosis of Abeta plaques. In conclusion, the Abeta1-42-BMDCs plus splenocytes treatment improved the phagocytosis of microglia and prevented AD pathology more effectively. This combined immunotherapy provided a promising treatment in preventing the progression of AD in clinical studies in the near future.

25086857|t|Assessment of CSF Abeta42 as an aid to discriminating Alzheimer's disease from other dementias and mild cognitive impairment: a meta-analysis of 50 studies.
25086857|a|Mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) is usually difficult to differentiate from other dementias or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The aim of our study is to evaluate the clinical importance of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) beta-amyloid 42 (Abeta42) in MCI, AD and other dementias, more specifically: frontotemporal dementia (FTD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson's disease (PD) with dementia (PDD) and vascular dementia (VaD). Fifty eligible articles were identified by search of databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Elsevier, Springer Link and the Cochrane Library, from January 1990 to May 2014. The random effects model was used to calculate the standardized mean difference (SMD) with corresponding 95% CI by STATA 9.0 software. The subgroup analyses were made on the method (ELISA, xMAP). We found that CSF Abeta42 concentrations were significantly lower in AD compared to MCI (SMD: -0.68, 95% CI: [-0.80, -0.56], z=11.34, P<0.001), FTD (SMD: -1.09, 95% CI: [-1.41, -0.76], z=6.62, P<0.001), PDD (SMD: -0.75, 95% CI: [-1.39, -0.10], z=2.27, P=0.023), VaD (SMD: -0.95, 95% CI: [-1.30, -0.61], z=5.43, P<0.001). In addition, compared to DLB, Abeta42 concentrations are moderately lower in AD (SMD: -0.27, 95% CI: [-0.51, -0.03], z=2.20, P=0.028). Results from this meta-analysis hinted that CSF Abeta42 is a good biomarker for discriminating Alzheimer's disease from other dementias and MCI.

25086887|t|Detection and quantification of plasma amyloid-beta by selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry.
25086887|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) in human plasma was detected and quantified by an antibody-free method, selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (SRM-MS) in the current study. Due to its low abundance, SRM-based quantification in 10 muL plasma was a challenge. Prior to SRM analysis, human plasma proteins as a whole were digested by trypsin and high pH reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) was used to fractionate the tryptic digests and to collect peptides, Abeta(1-5), Abeta(6-16), Abeta(17-28) and Abeta(29-40(42)) of either Abeta(1-40) or Abeta(1-42). Among those peptides, Abeta(17-28) was selected as a surrogate to measure the total Abeta level. Human plasma samples obtained from triplicate sample preparations were analyzed, obtaining 4.20 ng mL(-1) with a CV of 25.3%. Triplicate measurements for each sample preparation showed CV of <5%. Limit of quantification was obtained as 132 pM, which corresponded to 570 pg mL(-1) of Abeta(1-40). Until now, most quantitative measurements of Abeta in plasma or cerebrospinal fluid have required antibody-based immunoassays. Since quantification of Abeta by immunoassays is highly dependent on the extent of epitope exposure due to aggregation or plasma protein binding, it is difficult to accurately measure the actual concentration of Abeta in plasma. Our diagnostic method based on SRM using a surrogate peptide of Abeta is promising in that actual amounts of total Abeta can be measured regardless of the conformational status of the biomarker.

25087121|t|Amyloid-beta (25-35) peptide induces the release of pro-matrix metalloprotease 9 (pro-MMP-9) from human neutrophils.
25087121|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative process of the brain, leading to increasing impairment of cognitive functions, and is associated with accumulation in the brain of several amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides (as amyloid plaques), including Abeta25-35. Neutrophils, the most abundant immune cell type infiltrated in the brain of AD patients, accumulate behind amyloid plaques. Abeta peptides can trigger activation of chemotaxis and oxidative burst in neutrophils, suggesting a role in modulating the neuroinflammation process. We have shown that Abeta25-35 can induce the release from human neutrophils of pro-MMP-9, a metalloprotease involved in the onset of inflammation, corroborating the hypothesis of the involvement of infiltrated neutrophils in the inflammatory processes, which occur in the AD brain.

25087695|t|Myeloid microvesicles in cerebrospinal fluid are associated with myelin damage and neuronal loss in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease.
25087695|a|OBJECTIVES: We have described cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) myeloid microvesicles (MVs) as a marker of microglia activation during neuroinflammation in Alzheimer disease (AD), and characterized their ability to produce toxic amyloid beta1-42 (Abeta1-42 ) oligomers from aggregated or soluble substrate. The aim of this study is to investigate the association of CSF myeloid MVs with neuroimaging, clinical, and paraclinical data in AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: We collected CSF from 106 AD patients, 51 MCI patients, and 29 neurologically healthy controls. We examined CSF myeloid MV content and AD markers. A subgroup of 34 AD and 21 MCI patients underwent structural and diffusion tensor MRI. RESULTS: Higher levels of myeloid MVs were found in the CSF of AD patients and MCI patients converting within 3 years relative to controls, but also, at a lower level, in MCI patients not converting to AD. CSF myeloid MVs were associated with Tau but not with Abeta1-42 CSF levels. CSF MVs levels correlated with white matter (WM) tract damage in MCI, and with hippocampal atrophy in AD. INTERPRETATION: Microglial MVs are neurotoxic and myelinotoxic in the presence of Abeta1-42 . CSF myeloid MVs, mirroring microglia activation and MV release, are associated with WM damage in MCI and hippocampal atrophy in AD. This suggests that hippocampal microglia activation, in the presence of Abeta1-42 in excess, produces neurotoxic and oligodendrotoxic oligomers that, through WM tract damage, spread disease to neighboring and connected areas, causing local microglia activation and propagation of disease through the same sequence of events.

25087756|t|Active immunotherapy facilitates Abeta plaque removal following through microglial activation without obvious T cells infiltrating the CNS.
25087756|a|Immunization of AD mouse models with Abeta reduced Abeta deposits and improved memory and learning deficits, but some clinical trials of immunization with Abeta were halted due to brain inflammation which was presumably induced by a T cell-mediated autoimmune response. We have developed a "possibly safer" vaccine. Our results demonstrate that pcDNA3.1 vector encoding ten repeats of Abeta3-10 fragments elicited high titers of antibodies which reacted well with not only monomeric but also oligomeric and fibrillar forms of Abeta42 peptide. Induced antibodies strongly reacted with amyloid plaques in the brain, demonstrating functional activity of the antibodies. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence showed there was significantly less plaque deposition accomplied with less microglia activation as detected both in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. These data suggested that microglial activation is necessary for efficient removal of compact amyloid deposits with immunotherapy. No obvious inflammation T cell and Prussian blue positive cell was found indicated that inflammation T cell infiltration and microhemmorage can be avoided or at least reduced to the minimum level.

25088549|t|Syntheses of coumarin-tacrine hybrids as dual-site acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and their activity against butylcholinesterase, Abeta aggregation, and beta-secretase.
25088549|a|Exploring small-molecule acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors to slow the breakdown of acetylcholine (Ach) represents the mainstream direction for Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapy. As the first acetylcholinesterase inhibitor approved for the clinical treatment of AD, tacrine has been widely used as a pharmacophore to design hybrid compounds in order to combine its potent AChE inhibition with other multi-target profiles. In present study, a series of novel tacrine-coumarin hybrids were designed, synthesized and evaluated as potent dual-site AChE inhibitors. Moreover, compound 1g was identified as the most potent candidate with about 2-fold higher potency (Ki=16.7nM) against human AChE and about 2-fold lower potency (Ki=16.1nM) against BChE than tacrine (Ki=35.7nM for AChE, Ki=8.7nM for BChE), respectively. In addition, some of the tacrine-coumarin hybrids showed simultaneous inhibitory effects against both Abeta aggregation and beta-secretase. We therefore conclude that tacrine-coumarin hybrid is an interesting multifunctional lead for the AD drug discovery.

25088660|t|Lung cancer screening using low-dose CT: the current national landscape.
25088660|a|OBJECTIVES: Although the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) lauds the efficacy of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) at reducing lung cancer mortality, it has not been widely used for population-based screening. By examining the availability of U.S. LDCT screening centers, and underlying rates of lung cancer incidence, mortality, and smoking prevalence, the need for additional centers may be determined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Locations of 203 LDCT screening centers from the Lung Cancer Alliance Screening Centers of Excellence database, a list of active NLST and International Early Lung and Cardiac Action Program (I-ELCAP) screening centers, and an independently conducted survey of Society of Thoracic Radiology members were geocoded and mapped. County-level rates of lung cancer incidence, mortality, and smoking prevalence were also mapped and overlaid with the locations of the 203 LDCT screening centers. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Results showed the majority of LDCT screening centers were located in the counties with the highest quartiles of lung cancer incidence and mortality in the Northeast and East North Central states, but several high-risk states had no or few identified screening centers including Oklahoma, Nevada, Mississippi, and Arkansas. As guidelines are implemented and reimbursement for LDCT screening follows, equitable access to LDCT screening centers will become increasingly important, particularly in regions with high rates of lung cancer incidence and smoking prevalence.

25091487|t|The role of ubiquitin-proteasome in the metabolism of amyloid precursor protein (APP): implications for novel therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease.
25091487|a|The proteasome serves as a major protein quality control system inside the cell. Dysfunction of this system has been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Amyloid beta accumulation is considered as the central molecular event in the development of AD. This accumulation can result from dysregulated proteolysis of its precursor, APP. Here, we will review the evidence that links proteasome dysfunction to altered APP metabolism, and summarize recent progress in identifying the regulators of APP ubiquitination. Pinpointing UPS components that are APP-specific could lead new pharmaceutical strategies to combat AD.

25092575|t|Intracellular amyloid and the neuronal origin of Alzheimer neuritic plaques.
25092575|a|Genetic analysis of familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) causally links the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and AD. However, the specific type of amyloid and mechanisms of amyloid pathogenesis remain unclear. We conducted a detailed analysis of intracellular amyloid with an aggregation specific conformation dependent monoclonal antibody, M78, raised against fibrillar Ass42. M78 immunoreactivity colocalizes with Ass and the carboxyl terminus of APP (APP-CTF) immunoreactivities in perinuclear compartments at intermediate times in 10month 3XTg-AD mice, indicating that this represents misfolded and aggregated protein rather than normally folded APP. At 12months, M78 immunoreactivity also accumulates in the nucleus. Neuritic plaques at 12months display the same spatial organization of centrally colocalized M78, diffuse chromatin and neuronal nuclear NeuN staining surrounded by peripheral M78 and APP-CTF immunoreactivity as observed in neurons, indicating that neuritic plaques arise from degenerating neurons with intracellular amyloid immunoreactivity. The same staining pattern was observed in neuritic plaques in human AD brains, showing elevated intracellular M78 immunoreactivity at intermediate stages of amyloid pathology (Braak A and B) compared to no amyloid pathology and late stage amyloid pathology (Braak 0 and C, respectively). These results indicate that intraneuronal protein aggregation and amyloid accumulation is an early event in AD and that neuritic plaques are initiated by the degeneration and death of neurons by a mechanism that may be related to the formation of extracellular traps by neutrophils.

25093460|t|Inhibitor of the tyrosine phosphatase STEP reverses cognitive deficits in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
25093460|a|STEP (STriatal-Enriched protein tyrosine Phosphatase) is a neuron-specific phosphatase that regulates N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) trafficking, as well as ERK1/2, p38, Fyn, and Pyk2 activity. STEP is overactive in several neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The increase in STEP activity likely disrupts synaptic function and contributes to the cognitive deficits in AD. AD mice lacking STEP have restored levels of glutamate receptors on synaptosomal membranes and improved cognitive function, results that suggest STEP as a novel therapeutic target for AD. Here we describe the first large-scale effort to identify and characterize small-molecule STEP inhibitors. We identified the benzopentathiepin 8-(trifluoromethyl)-1,2,3,4,5-benzopentathiepin-6-amine hydrochloride (known as TC-2153) as an inhibitor of STEP with an IC50 of 24.6 nM. TC-2153 represents a novel class of PTP inhibitors based upon a cyclic polysulfide pharmacophore that forms a reversible covalent bond with the catalytic cysteine in STEP. In cell-based secondary assays, TC-2153 increased tyrosine phosphorylation of STEP substrates ERK1/2, Pyk2, and GluN2B, and exhibited no toxicity in cortical cultures. Validation and specificity experiments performed in wild-type (WT) and STEP knockout (KO) cortical cells and in vivo in WT and STEP KO mice suggest specificity of inhibitors towards STEP compared to highly homologous tyrosine phosphatases. Furthermore, TC-2153 improved cognitive function in several cognitive tasks in 6- and 12-mo-old triple transgenic AD (3xTg-AD) mice, with no change in beta amyloid and phospho-tau levels.

25093956|t|Effect of the Interaction of the amyloid beta (1-42) peptide with short single-stranded synthetic nucleotide sequences: morphological characterization of the inhibition of fibrils formation and fibrils disassembly.
25093956|a|The formation of extracellular neuritic plaques in the brain of individuals who suffered from Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major pathological hallmark. These plaques consist of filamentous aggregates of the amyloid beta (1-42) (Abeta42) proteins. Prevention or reduction of the formation of these fibrils is foreseen as a potential therapeutic approach. In this context, we investigated the interactions between the Abeta42 protein and polyions, in particular short single stranded synthetic nucleotide sequences. The experimental outcomes reported herein provide evidence of the inhibition of amyloid fibril genesis as well as disassembly of existing fibers through electrostatic interaction between the Abeta42 protein and the polyions. Since the polyions and the Abeta42 protein are oppositely charged, the formation of (micellar) inter polyelectrolyte complexes (IPECs) is likely to occur. Since the abnormal deposition of amyloid fibers is an archetype of AD, the outcomes of these investigations, supported by atomic force microscopy imaging in the dry and liquid states, as well as circular dichroism and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, are of high interest for the development of future strategies to cure a disease that concerns an ever aging population.

25099276|t|Biological metals and metal-targeting compounds in major neurodegenerative diseases.
25099276|a|Multiple abnormalities occur in the homeostasis of essential endogenous brain biometals in age-related neurodegenerative disorders, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. As a result, metals both accumulate in microscopic proteinopathies, and can be deficient in cells or cellular compartments. Therefore, bulk measurement of metal content in brain tissue samples reveal only the "tip of the iceberg", with most of the important changes occurring on a microscopic and biochemical level. Each of the major proteins implicated in these disorders interacts with biological transition metals. Tau and the amyloid protein precursor have important roles in normal neuronal iron homeostasis. Changes in metal distribution, cellular deficiencies, or sequestration in proteinopathies all present abnormalities that can be corrected in animal models by small molecules. These biochemical targets are more complex than the simple excess of metals that are targeted by chelators. In this review we illustrate some of the richness in the science that has developed in the study of metals in neurodegeneration, and explore its novel pharmacology.

25100189|t|Bridging the gap between the nanostructural organization and macroscopic interfacial rheology of amyloid fibrils at liquid interfaces.
25100189|a|The interfacial behavior of proteins and protein aggregates such as fibrils influences the bulk behavior of multiphase systems in foods, pharmaceuticals, and other technological applications. Additionally, it is an important factor in some biological processes such as the accumulation of amyloid fibrils at biological membranes in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, using beta-lactoglobulin fibrils as a model system, we cover a large range of characteristic measuring length scales by combining atomic force microscopy, passive probe particle tracking, tensiometry, interfacial shear, and dilatational rheology in order to correlate the intricate structure of fibril-laden interfaces with their macroscopic adsorption kinetics and viscoelasticity. A subtle change in solution pH provokes pronounced changes in interfacial properties such as alignment, entanglement, multilayer formation, and fibril fracture, which can be resolved and linked across the various length scales involved.

25100603|t|Knock-in of human BACE1 cleaves murine APP and reiterates Alzheimer-like phenotypes.
25100603|a|Key neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are elevated levels of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) species generated via amyloid precursor protein (APP) endoproteolysis and cleavage by the rate-limiting beta-site enzyme 1 (BACE1). Because rodents do not develop amyloid pathologies, we here investigated whether AD-like endophenotypes can be created in mice by expression of human bace1. To avoid pitfalls of existing models, we introduced hbace1 via knock-in under the control of the CaMKII alpha promoter into the safe HPRT locus. We report amyloidogenic processing of murine APP in the hBACE1 mice (termed PLB4), resulting in the formation of toxic APP metabolites that accumulate intra- and extraneuronally in hippocampus and cortex. Pronounced accumulation of Abeta*56 and Abeta hexamers in the absence of plaque deposition was detected in brain tissue from symptomatic PLB4 mice. Heightened levels of inflammation (gliosis) also appeared in several AD-related brain regions (dentate gyrus, hippocampal area CA1, piriform and parietal cortices) at 6 and 12 months of age. Behaviorally, deficits in habituation to a novel environment and semantic-like memory (social transmission of food preference) were detected from 3 to 4 months of age. Impairments in spatial learning strategies in long-term reference (water maze) and working memory (Y-maze) tasks presented at 6 months, and were distinct from reductions in locomotor activity and anxiety. Overall, our data indicate for the first time that targeted, subtle forebrain-specific expression through single gene knock-in of hBACE1 is sufficient to generate AD-relevant cognitive impairments amid corresponding histopathologies, confirming human BACE as the key parameter in amyloid pathogenesis.

25100721|t|Non-chaperone proteins can inhibit aggregation and cytotoxicity of Alzheimer amyloid beta peptide.
25100721|a|Many factors are known to influence the oligomerization, fibrillation, and amyloid formation of the Abeta peptide that is associated with Alzheimer disease. Other proteins that are present when Abeta peptides deposit in vivo are likely to have an effect on these aggregation processes. To separate specific versus broad spectrum effects of proteins on Abeta aggregation, we tested a series of proteins not reported to have chaperone activity: catalase, pyruvate kinase, albumin, lysozyme, alpha-lactalbumin, and beta-lactoglobulin. All tested proteins suppressed the fibrillation of Alzheimer Abeta(1-40) peptide at substoichiometric ratios, albeit some more effectively than others. All proteins bound non-specifically to Abeta, stabilized its random coils, and reduced its cytotoxicity. Surprisingly, pyruvate kinase and catalase were at least as effective as known chaperones in inhibiting Abeta aggregation. We propose general mechanisms for the broad-spectrum inhibition Abeta fibrillation by proteins. The mechanisms we discuss are significant for prognostics and perhaps even for prevention and treatment of Alzheimer disease.

25100729|t|Distinguishing closely related amyloid precursors using an RNA aptamer.
25100729|a|Although amyloid fibrils assembled in vitro commonly involve a single protein, fibrils formed in vivo can contain multiple protein sequences. The amyloidogenic protein human beta2-microglobulin (hbeta2m) can co-polymerize with its N-terminally truncated variant (DeltaN6) in vitro to form hetero-polymeric fibrils that differ from their homo-polymeric counterparts. Discrimination between the different assembly precursors, for example by binding of a biomolecule to one species in a mixture of conformers, offers an opportunity to alter the course of co-assembly and the properties of the fibrils formed. Here, using hbeta2m and its amyloidogenic counterpart, DeltaNu6, we describe selection of a 2'F-modified RNA aptamer able to distinguish between these very similar proteins. SELEX with a N30 RNA pool yielded an aptamer (B6) that binds hbeta2m with an EC50 of ~200 nM. NMR spectroscopy was used to assign the (1)H-(15)N HSQC spectrum of the B6-hbeta2m complex, revealing that the aptamer binds to the face of hbeta2m containing the A, B, E, and D beta-strands. In contrast, binding of B6 to DeltaN6 is weak and less specific. Kinetic analysis of the effect of B6 on co-polymerization of hbeta2m and DeltaN6 revealed that the aptamer alters the kinetics of co-polymerization of the two proteins. The results reveal the potential of RNA aptamers as tools for elucidating the mechanisms of co-assembly in amyloid formation and as reagents able to discriminate between very similar protein conformers with different amyloid propensity.

25100745|t|Insulin-like growth factor 2 reverses memory and synaptic deficits in APP transgenic mice.
25100745|a|Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) was recently found to play a critical role in memory consolidation in rats and mice, and hippocampal or systemic administration of recombinant IGF2 enhances memory. Here, using a gene therapy-based approach with adeno-associated virus (AAV), we show that IGF2 overexpression in the hippocampus of aged wild-type mice enhances memory and promotes dendritic spine formation. Furthermore, we report that IGF2 expression decreases in the hippocampus of patients with Alzheimer's disease, and this leads us to hypothesize that increased IGF2 levels may be beneficial for treating the disease. Thus, we used the AAV system to deliver IGF2 or IGF1 into the hippocampus of the APP mouse model Tg2576 and demonstrate that IGF2 and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) rescue behavioural deficits, promote dendritic spine formation and restore normal hippocampal excitatory synaptic transmission. The brains of Tg2576 mice that overexpress IGF2 but not IGF1 also show a significant reduction in amyloid levels. This reduction probably occurs through an interaction with the IGF2 receptor (IGF2R). Hence, IGF2 and, to a lesser extent, IGF1 may be effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease.

25101540|t|Interactions between Abeta oligomers and presynaptic cholinergic signaling: age-dependent effects on attentional capacities.
25101540|a|Substantial evidence suggests that cerebral deposition of the neurotoxic fibrillar form of amyloid precursor protein, beta-amyloid (Abeta), plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet, many aspects of AD pathology including the cognitive symptoms and selective vulnerability of cortically projecting basal forebrain (BF) cholinergic neurons are not well explained by this hypothesis. Specifically, it is not clear why cognitive decline appears early when the loss of BF cholinergic neurons and plaque deposition are manifested late in AD. Soluble oligomeric forms of Abeta are proposed to appear early in the pathology and to be better predictors of synaptic loss and cognitive deficits. The present study was designed to examine the impact of Abeta oligomers on attentional functions and presynaptic cholinergic transmission in young and aged rats. Chronic intracranial infusions of Abeta oligomers produced subtle decrements in the ability of rats to sustain attentional performance with time on task, irrespective of the age of the animals. However, Abeta oligomers produced robust detrimental effects on performance under conditions of enhanced attentional load in aged animals. In vivo electrochemical recordings show reduced depolarization-evoked cholinergic signals in Abeta-infused aged rats. Moreover, soluble Abeta disrupted the capacity of cholinergic synapses to clear exogenous choline from the extracellular space in both young and aged rats, reflecting impairments in the choline transport process that is critical for acetylcholine (ACh) synthesis and release. Although aging per se reduced the cross-sectional area of BF cholinergic neurons and presynaptic cholinergic proteins in the cortex, attentional performance and ACh release remained unaffected in aged rats infused with the control peptide. Taken together, these data suggest that soluble Abeta may marginally influence attentional functions at young ages primarily by interfering with the choline uptake processes. However, age-related weakening of the cholinergic system may synergistically interact with these disruptive presynaptic mechanisms to make this neurotransmitter system vulnerable to the toxic effects of oligomeric Abeta in robustly impeding attentional capacities.

25102326|t|Persistent sodium currents contribute to Abeta1-42-induced hyperexcitation of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.
25102326|a|Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have elevated incidence of epilepsy. Moreover, neuronal hyperexcitation occurs in transgenic mouse models overexpressing amyloid precursor protein and its pathogenic product, amyloid beta protein (Abeta). However, the cellular mechanisms of how Abeta causes neuronal hyperexcitation are largely unknown. We hypothesize that the persistent sodium current (INaP), a subthreshold sodium current that can increase neuronal excitability, may in part account for the Abeta-induced neuronal hyperexcitation. The present study was designed to evaluate the involvement of INaP in Abeta-induced hyperexcitation of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons using a whole-cell patch-clamp recording technique. Our results showed that bath application of soluble Abeta1-42 increased neuronal excitability in a concentration-dependent manner. Soluble Abeta1-42 also increased the amplitude of INaP without significantly affecting its activation properties. In the presence of riluzole (RLZ), an antagonist of INaP, the Abeta1-42-induced neuronal hyperexcitation and INaP augmentation were significantly inhibited. These findings suggest that soluble Abeta1-42 may induce neuronal hyperexcitation by increasing the amplitude of INaP and that RLZ can inhibit the Abeta1-42-induced abnormal neuronal activity.

25102344|t|Evidence for lymphatic Abeta clearance in Alzheimer's transgenic mice.
25102344|a|Evidence has shown that lymphatic drainage contributes to removal of debris from the brain but its role in the accumulation of amyloid beta peptides (Abeta) has not been demonstrated. We examined the levels of various forms of Abeta in the brain, plasma and lymph nodes in a transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) at different ages. Herein, we report on the novel finding that Abeta is present in the cervical and axillary lymph nodes of AD transgenic mice and that Abeta levels in lymph nodes increase over time, mirroring the increase of Abeta levels observed in the brain. Abeta levels in lymph nodes were significantly higher than in plasma. At age 15.5months, there was a significant increase of monomeric soluble Abeta40 (p=0.003) and Abeta42 (p=0.05) in the lymph nodes over the baseline values measured at 6months of age. In contrast, plasma levels of Abeta40 showed no significant changes (p=0.68) and plasma levels Abeta42 significantly dropped (p=0.02) at the same age. Abeta concentration was low to undetectable in splenic lymphoid tissue and several other control tissues including heart, lung, liver, kidneys and intestine of the same animals, strongly suggesting that Abeta peptides in lymph nodes are derived from the brain.

25106752|t|Impaired retention in AbetaPP Swedish mice six months after oral exposure to chlorpyrifos.
25106752|a|Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is an organophosphate pesticide. This pesticide induces cognitive impairments, oxidative stress and neuronal damage, which suggests a possible relationship between CPF exposure and Alzheimer's disease. In this study we examined long-term changes in behavior and brain levels of the amyloid beta (Abeta) protein after repeated CPF exposure in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Tg2576 male mice between four and six months of age carrying the human Swedish mutation for Alzheimer's disease were exposed to eight doses of 25 mg/kg of CPF distributed over four weeks. Five months after exposure, general activity was measured in an open-field, while learning and memory were assessed in a Morris water maze task six months after treatment with CPF. Levels of the Abeta fragments (1-40 and 1-42) were also measured in the frontal cortex and hippocampal brain regions. Motor activity was increased in CPF-exposed mice. Although acquisition learning in a water maze task was not affected, retention was worsened in CPF-exposed mice. There were no significant increases of Abeta levels in the brains of CPF-treated mice six months after exposure. These findings raise concerns about the risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases in vulnerable subjects following repeated exposure to CPF.

25106883|t|Effect of the Abeta aggregation modulator MRZ-99030 on retinal damage in an animal model of glaucoma.
25106883|a|Several lines of evidence suggest that there are similarities in the pathomechanisms of glaucoma and Alzheimer's disease, and that amyloid-beta (Abeta) could be a new, promising target for neuroprotective therapy of glaucoma. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of the Abeta aggregation modulator MRZ-99030 in the Morrison model of glaucoma based on increased intraocular pressure (IOP) in rats. MRZ-99030 provided dose-dependent neuroprotection and at the highest dose (240 mg/kg) reduced the degree of RGC apoptosis to 33 % of that seen after vehicle (P < 0.05; one-way ANOVA). No significant effect on IOP was observed. Pharmacokinetic experiments showed that following systemic injection of MRZ-99030, concentrations above affinity for Abeta were reached. Hence the present results are consistent with the notion that Abeta is a promising target for neuroprotective intervention in glaucoma and that MRZ-99030 may be a good drug candidate for further development.

25108368|t|The relevance of beta-amyloid on markers of Alzheimer's disease in clinically normal individuals and factors that influence these associations.
25108368|a|Aberrant accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) is thought to be an early event in a biological cascade that eventually leads to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Along these lines, many clinically normal (CN) older individuals have evidence of beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation, which may be indicative of preclinical AD. However, relationships between Abeta and "downstream" AD markers are often inconsistent across studies. These inconsistencies may be due to the presence of other age-related processes that also influence AD markers, as well as additional risk factors that interact with Abeta to influence downstream changes. For instance, it is possible that the effect of Abeta is modified by neurodegeneration, genetics, sex-differences and cognitive reserve. Thus, a multivariate approach to determining risk of AD within CN participants may be more appropriate than reliance on Abeta status alone. An understanding of how additional risk factors interact with Abeta to influence an individual's trajectory towards AD is essential for characterizing preclinical AD and has implications for prevention trials.

25108596|t|Baicalin attenuates alzheimer-like pathological changes and memory deficits induced by amyloid beta1-42 protein.
25108596|a|Baicalin is one bioactive flavone with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities. The neuroprotective effects of baicalin on pathological changes and behavioral deficits were explored in a mouse model of amyloid beta (Abeta)(1-42) protein-induced Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mice received a bilateral injection of Abeta(1-42) protein into the hippocampus, then they were treated with baicalin (30, 50 and 100 mg/kg body weight, orally) or Tween 80. The therapeutic effects of baicalin were monitored by Morris water maze trial and probe test. Then mice were sacrificed for immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. After a relatively short-term treatment of 14 days, 100 mg/kg of baicalin significantly ameliorated memory impairment in the Morris water maze test and probe test, and also attenuated glial cell activations and increase of TNF-alpha and IL-6 expressions induced by Abeta(1-42) protein. These results suggest that baicalin ameliorated Abeta(1-42) protein-related pathology and cognitive dysfunction via its anti-neuroinflammatory activity, and may be a potential candidate for the treatment of AD.

25109373|t|Fibrillar beta-amyloid 1-42 alters cytokine secretion, cholinergic signalling and neuronal differentiation.
25109373|a|Adult neurogenesis is impaired by inflammatory processes, which are linked to altered cholinergic signalling and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we investigated how amyloid beta (Abeta)-evoked inflammatory responses affect the generation of new neurons from human embryonic stem (hES) cells and the role of cholinergic signalling in regulating this process. The hES were cultured as neurospheres and exposed to fibrillar and oligomeric Abeta(1-42) (Abetaf, AbetaO) or to conditioned medium from human primary microglia activated with either Abeta(1-42) or lipopolysaccharide. The neurospheres were differentiated for 29 days in vitro and the resulting neuronal or glial phenotypes were thereafter assessed. Secretion of cytokines and the enzymes acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) involved in cholinergic signalling was measured in medium throughout the differentiation. We report that differentiating neurospheres released various cytokines, and exposure to Abetaf, but not AbetaO, increased the secretion of IL-6, IL-1beta and IL-2. Abetaf also influenced the levels of AChE, BuChE and ChAT in favour of a low level of acetylcholine. These changes were linked to an altered secretion pattern of cytokines. A different pattern was observed in microglia activated by Abetaf, demonstrating decreased secretion of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-2 relative to untreated cells. Subsequent exposure of differentiating neurospheres to Abetaf or to microglia-conditioned medium decreased neuronal differentiation and increased glial differentiation. We suggest that a basal physiological secretion of cytokines is involved in shaping the differentiation of neurospheres and that Abetaf decreases neurogenesis by promoting a microenvironment favouring hypo-cholinergic signalling and gliogenesis.

25110104|t|High plasma fetuin-A levels are associated with metabolic syndrome among males but not females in a Japanese general population.
25110104|a|AIMS: Fetuin-A, a protein exclusively secreted from the liver, is associated with insulin resistance and/or metabolic syndrome (MetS). However, few studies have examined this association in Japan. We investigated this issue in a Japanese general population. METHODS: We performed an epidemiological survey in a small community in Japan. The participants consisted of 659 subjects (253 males and 406 females). Fetuin-A levels were measured by a sandwich ELISA method and the modified NCEP-ATP III criteria were adopted to diagnose MetS. The homeostasis model assessment index (HOMA-IR) was calculated as a marker of insulin resistance. RESULTS: Statistically significant characteristics of the 659 subjects stratified by fetuin-A quartiles were male gender (inversely), age (inversely), insulin, HOMA-IR, uric acid (inversely), alcohol intake (inversely) and the prevalence of MetS. Mean fetuin-A levels were 249.7+-45.1mug/ml in males and 262.7+-55.8mug/ml in females. In males, the prevalence of MetS was 43.1%, and their mean HOMA-IR level was 1.1. In females, the prevalence of MetS was 17.7%, and their mean HOMA-IR level was 0.9. Multiple stepwise regression analyses showed that fetuin-A levels in males but not females were independently associated with MetS and LDL-c. Multiple logistic regression analysis of fetuin-A (quartile 1 vs. quartile 4) in males showed significant odds ratios of 1.009 (95% C.I.: 1.003-1.015) for MetS and 1.376 (95% C.I.: 1.027-1.844) for 1-SD increment increase in LDL-c. CONCLUSIONS: High plasma fetuin-A levels were associated with MetS in community-dwelling Japanese males but not females.

25110379|t|Success factors for reducing maternal and child mortality.
25110379|a|Reducing maternal and child mortality is a priority in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and will likely remain so after 2015. Evidence exists on the investments, interventions and enabling policies required. Less is understood about why some countries achieve faster progress than other comparable countries. The Success Factors for Women's and Children's Health studies sought to address this knowledge gap using statistical and econometric analyses of data from 144 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) over 20 years; Boolean, qualitative comparative analysis; a literature review; and country-specific reviews in 10 fast-track countries for MDGs 4 and 5a. There is no standard formula--fast-track countries deploy tailored strategies and adapt quickly to change. However, fast-track countries share some effective approaches in addressing three main areas to reduce maternal and child mortality. First, these countries engage multiple sectors to address crucial health determinants. Around half the reduction in child mortality in LMICs since 1990 is the result of health sector investments, the other half is attributed to investments made in sectors outside health. Second, these countries use strategies to mobilize partners across society, using timely, robust evidence for decision-making and accountability and a triple planning approach to consider immediate needs, long-term vision and adaptation to change. Third, the countries establish guiding principles that orient progress, align stakeholder action and achieve results over time. This evidence synthesis contributes to global learning on accelerating improvements in women's and children's health towards 2015 and beyond.

25111166|t|Effects of the absence of apolipoprotein e on lipoproteins, neurocognitive function, and retinal function.
25111166|a|IMPORTANCE: The identification of a patient with a rare form of severe dysbetalipoproteinemia allowed the study of the consequences of total absence of apolipoprotein E (apoE). OBJECTIVES: To discover the molecular basis of this rare disorder and to determine the effects of complete absence of apoE on neurocognitive and visual function and on lipoprotein metabolism. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Whole-exome sequencing was performed on the patient's DNA. He underwent detailed neurological and visual function testing and lipoprotein analysis. Lipoprotein analysis was also performed in the Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, on blood samples from the proband's mother, wife, 2 daughters, and normolipidemic control participants. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Whole-exome sequencing, lipoprotein analysis, and neurocognitive function. RESULTS: The patient was homozygous for an ablative APOE frameshift mutation (c.291del, p.E97fs). No other mutations likely to contribute to the phenotype were discovered, with the possible exception of two, in ABCC2 (p.I670T) and LIPC (p.G137R). Despite complete absence of apoE, he had normal vision, exhibited normal cognitive, neurological, and retinal function, had normal findings on brain magnetic resonance imaging, and had normal cerebrospinal fluid levels of beta-amyloid and tau proteins. He had no significant symptoms of cardiovascular disease except a suggestion of myocardial ischemia on treadmill testing and mild atherosclerosis noted on carotid ultrasonography. He had exceptionally high cholesterol content (760 mg/dL; to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259) and a high cholesterol to triglycerides ratio (1.52) in very low-density lipoproteins with elevated levels of small-diameter high-density lipoproteins, including high levels of prebeta-1 high-density lipoprotein. Intermediate-density lipoproteins, low-density lipoproteins, and very low-density lipoproteins contained elevated apoA-I and apoA-IV levels. The patient's apoC-III and apoC-IV levels were decreased in very low-density lipoproteins. Electron microscopy revealed large lamellar particles having electron-opaque cores attached to electron-lucent zones in intermediate-density and low-density lipoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein particle diameters were distributed bimodally. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Despite a profound effect on lipoprotein metabolism, detailed neurocognitive and retinal studies failed to demonstrate any defects. This suggests that functions of apoE in the brain and eye are not essential or that redundant mechanisms exist whereby its role can be fulfilled. Targeted knockdown of apoE in the central nervous system might be a therapeutic modality in neurodegenerative disorders.

25111601|t|Pentameric thiophene-based ligands that spectrally discriminate amyloid-beta and tau aggregates display distinct solvatochromism and viscosity-induced spectral shifts.
25111601|a|A wide range of neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the deposition of multiple protein aggregates. Ligands for molecular characterization and discrimination of these pathological hallmarks are thus important for understanding their potential role in pathogenesis as well as for clinical diagnosis of the disease. In this regard, luminescent conjugated oligothiophenes (LCOs) have proven useful for spectral discrimination of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), two of the pathological hallmarks associated with Alzheimer's disease. Herein, the solvatochromism of a library of anionic pentameric thiophene-based ligands, as well as their ability to spectrally discriminate Abeta and tau aggregates, were investigated. Overall, the results from this study identified distinct solvatochromic and viscosity-dependent behavior of thiophene-based ligands that can be applied as indices to direct the chemical design of improved LCOs for spectral separation of Abeta and tau aggregates in brain tissue sections. The results also suggest that the observed spectral transitions of the ligands are due to their ability to conform by induced fit to specific microenvironments within the binding interface of each particular protein aggregate. We foresee that these findings might aid in the chemical design of thiophene-based ligands that are increasingly selective for distinct disease-associated protein aggregates.

25111857|t|Ex vivo protective effects of nicotinamide and 3-aminobenzamide on rat synaptosomes treated with Abeta(1-42).
25111857|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and is characterized by the presence of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, along with synaptic loss. The underlying mechanisms of AD are not clarified yet, but oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are important factors. Overactivation of poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) enzyme has been known to cause neuroinflammation and cell death in neurodegenerative processes. The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effects of the PARP-1 inhibitors, 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB) and nicotinamide (NA), against amyloid beta peptide (1-42) (Abeta(1-42))-induced oxidative damage and mitochondrial reduction capacity on isolated synaptosomes. Rats were injected intraperitoneally with 3-AB (30-100 mg kg(-1)), NA (100-500 mg kg(-1)) or with saline for 7 days. Synaptosomes were incubated with 10-30 muM Abeta(1-42) or saline for 6 h at 37  C. Ex vivo Abeta(1-42) treatment significantly induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in synaptosomes of the saline group, while synaptosomes of 3-AB and NA groups showed significant decreases in lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen species production and protein oxidation. Moreover, both NA and 3-AB were able to improve the mitochondrial reduction capacity against Abeta(1-42). These data suggest that NA and 3-AB may have protective effects in neurodegenerative processes because of the reduced levels of oxidative stress and the improvement of mitochondrial function.

25112481|t|A comparison of the effectiveness of physical activity and sedentary behaviour interventions in reducing sedentary time in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials.
25112481|a|UNLABELLED: The objective of this study was to systematically review the literature and compare the effectiveness of controlled interventions with a focus on physical activity (PA) and/or sedentary behaviours (SBs) for reducing sedentary time in adults. Six electronic databases were searched to identify all studies that examined the effects of interventions that targeted PA and/or SBs and that reported on changes in SBs (sedentary, sitting or television time). A qualitative synthesis was performed for all studies, and meta-analyses conducted among studies with mean differences (min/d) of sedentary time. PROSPERO: CRD42014006535. Sixty-five controlled studies met inclusion criteria; 33 were used in the meta-analyses. Interventions with a focus on PA or that included a PA and SB component produced less consistent findings and generally resulted in modest reductions in sedentary time (PA: standardized mean differences [SMD] = -0.22 [95% confidence interval {CI}: -0.35, -0.10], PA+SB: SMD= -0.37 [95% CI: -0.69, -0.05]). Moderate quality evidence from the randomized controlled trial meta-analysis coupled with the qualitative synthesis provides consistent evidence that large and clinically meaningful reductions in sedentary time can be expected from interventions with a focus on reducing SBs (SMD= -1.28 [95% CI: -1.68, -0.87] ). There is evidence to support the need for interventions to include a component focused on reducing SBs in order to generate clinically meaningful reductions in sedentary time.

25113378|t|Proneurogenic Group II mGluR antagonist improves learning and reduces anxiety in Alzheimer Abeta oligomer mouse.
25113378|a|Proneurogenic compounds have recently shown promise in some mouse models of Alzheimer's pathology. Antagonists at Group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (Group II mGluR: mGlu2, mGlu3) are reported to stimulate neurogenesis. Agonists at those receptors trigger gamma-secretase-inhibitor-sensitive biogenesis of Abeta42 peptides from isolated synaptic terminals, which is selectively suppressed by antagonist pretreatment. We have assessed the therapeutic potential of chronic pharmacological inhibition of Group II mGluR in Dutch APP (Alzheimer's amyloid precursor protein E693Q) transgenic mice that accumulate Dutch amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers but never develop Abeta plaques. BCI-838 is a clinically well-tolerated, orally bioavailable, investigational prodrug that delivers to the brain BCI-632, the active Group II mGluR antagonist metabolite. Dutch Abeta-oligomer-forming APP transgenic mice (APP E693Q) were dosed with BCI-838 for 3 months. Chronic treatment with BCI-838 was associated with reversal of transgene-related amnestic behavior, reduction in anxiety, reduction in levels of brain Abeta monomers and oligomers, and stimulation of hippocampal neurogenesis. Group II mGluR inhibition may offer a unique package of relevant properties as an Alzheimer's disease therapeutic or prophylactic by providing both attenuation of neuropathology and stimulation of repair.

25115542|t|Fluoxetine improves behavioral performance by suppressing the production of soluble beta-amyloid in APP/PS1 mice.
25115542|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system. Current approaches for AD treatment only ameliorate symptoms. Therapeutic strategies that target the pathological processes of the disease remain elusive. Fluoxetine (FLX) is one of the most widely used antidepressants for the treatment of depression and anxiety associated with AD, however, it is unknown if the drug affects the pathogenesis of the disease. We showed that FLX improved spatial memory, learning and emotional behaviors of APP/PS1 mice, a well characterized model of AD. In the same mice, FLX effectively prevented the protein loss of synaptophysin (SYP) and microtubuleassociated protein 2 (MAP2). FLX was unable to prevent plaque formation, but significantly lowered high levels of soluble beta-amyloid (Abeta) in brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood sera. FLX also effectively inhibited the phosphorylation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) at T668, which may be a possible mechanism of the reduced Abeta production in APP/PS1 mouse after treatment.

25117080|t|Zn(2+) effect on structure and residual hydrophobicity of amyloid beta-peptide monomers.
25117080|a|The aggregation of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta peptide) has been associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, we aimed to disclose how Zn(2+) affects the Abeta aggregation in detail. Thus, molecular dynamics simulation was implemented to elucidate the changes of structure and residual hydrophobicity upon Zn(2+) coordination. Our results show that Zn(2+) can strongly influence the structural properties of Abeta40 and Abeta42 by reducing helical formation and increasing turn formation to expose the hydrophobic regions. Furthermore, hydrophobicity of Zn(2+)-Abeta40 and Zn(2+)-Abeta42 was much higher than that of each monomer, since Zn(2+) binding can significantly influence the hydrophilic domains of Abeta. The further analyses indicate that not only four residues (H6, E11, H13, and H14) but also R5, D7, K16, K28, and terminal residues influence hydrophobicity upon Zn(2+) coordination. Importantly, R5, K16, and K28 play a crucial role to regulate solvation-free energies. This work is helpful to understand the fundamental role of Zn(2+) in aggregation, which could be useful for further development of new drugs to inhibit Zn(2+)-Abeta aggregation.

25117930|t|Ethical considerations in HIV prevention and vaccine research in resource-limited settings.
25117930|a|HIV prevention research has been facing increasing ethical and operational challenges. Factors influencing the design and conduct of HIV prevention trials include a rapidly changing evidence base, new biomedical prevention methods and modalities being tested, a large diversity of countries, sites and populations affected by HIV and participating in trials, and challenges of developing and making available products that will be feasible and affordable for at-risk populations. To discuss these challenges, a meeting, Ethical considerations around novel combination prevention modalities in HIV prevention and vaccine trials in resource-limited settings, was convened by NIH/NIAID/Division of AIDS on April 22-23, 2013. Several themes emerged from the meeting: (1) because of both trial design and ethical complexities, choosing prevention packages and designing combination prevention research trials will need to be evaluated on a case by case basis in different clinical trials, countries, and health systems; (2) multilevel stakeholder engagement from the beginning is vital to a fair and transparent process and also to designing ethical and relevant trials; (3) research should generally be responsive to a host country's needs, and sponsors and stakeholders should work together to address potential barriers to future access; and finally, (4) another meeting including a broader group of stakeholders is needed to address many of the outstanding ethical issues raised by this meeting. We offer an overview of the meeting and the key discussion points and recommendations to help guide the design and conduct of future HIV prevention and vaccine research in resource-limited settings.

25118284|t|Amyloid-beta peptide-specific DARPins as a novel class of potential therapeutics for Alzheimer disease.
25118284|a|Passive immunization with anti-amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) antibodies is effective in animal models of Alzheimer disease. With the advent of efficient in vitro selection technologies, the novel class of designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) presents an attractive alternative to the immunoglobulin scaffold. DARPins are small and highly stable proteins with a compact modular architecture ideal for high affinity protein-protein interactions. In this report, we describe the selection, binding profile, and epitope analysis of Abeta-specific DARPins. We further showed their ability to delay Abeta aggregation and prevent Abeta-mediated neurotoxicity in vitro. To demonstrate their therapeutic potential in vivo, mono- and trivalent Abeta-specific DARPins (D23 and 3xD23) were infused intracerebroventricularly into the brains of 11-month-old Tg2576 mice over 4 weeks. Both D23 and 3xD23 treatments were shown to result in improved cognitive performance and reduced soluble Abeta levels. These findings demonstrate the therapeutic potential of Abeta-specific DARPins for the treatment of Alzheimer disease.

25118290|t|Antiparallel triple-strand architecture for prefibrillar Abeta42 oligomers.
25118290|a|Abeta42 oligomers play key roles in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease, but their structures remain elusive partly due to their transient nature. Here, we show that Abeta42 in a fusion construct can be trapped in a stable oligomer state, which recapitulates characteristics of prefibrillar Abeta42 oligomers and enables us to establish their detailed structures. Site-directed spin labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance studies provide structural restraints in terms of side chain mobility and intermolecular distances at all 42 residue positions. Using these restraints and other biophysical data, we present a novel atomic-level oligomer model. In our model, each Abeta42 protein forms a single beta-sheet with three beta-strands in an antiparallel arrangement. Each beta-sheet consists of four Abeta42 molecules in a head-to-tail arrangement. Four beta-sheets are packed together in a face-to-back fashion. The stacking of identical segments between different beta-sheets within an oligomer suggests that prefibrillar oligomers may interconvert with fibrils via strand rotation, wherein beta-strands undergo an ~90  rotation along the strand direction. This work provides insights into rational design of therapeutics targeting the process of interconversion between toxic oligomers and non-toxic fibrils.

25118934|t|Specific antibody binding to the APP672-699 region shifts APP processing from alpha- to beta-cleavage.
25118934|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, as well as a progressive loss of synapses and neurons in the brain. The major pertinacious component of amyloid plaques is Abeta, a variably sized peptide derived from the integral membrane protein amyloid precursor protein (APP). The Abeta region of APP locates partly within its ecto- and trans-membrane domains. APP is cleaved by three proteases, designated as alpha-, beta-, and gamma-secretases. Processing by beta- and gamma-secretase cleaves the N- and C-terminal ends of the Abeta region, respectively, releasing Abeta, whereas alpha-secretase cleaves within the Abeta sequence, releasing soluble APPalpha (sAPPalpha). The gamma-secretase cleaves at several adjacent sites to yield Abeta species containing 39-43 amino acid residues. Both alpha- and beta-cleavage sites of human wild-type APP are located in APP672-699 region (ectodomain of beta-C-terminal fragment, ED-beta-CTF or ED-C99). Therefore, the amino acid residues within or near this region are definitely pivotal for human wild-type APP function and processing. Here, we report that one ED-C99-specific monoclonal antibody (mAbED-C99) blocks human wild-type APP endocytosis and shifts its processing from alpha- to beta-cleavage, as evidenced by elevated accumulation of cell surface full-length APP and beta-CTF together with reduced sAPPalpha and alpha-CTF levels. Moreover, mAbED-C99 enhances the interactions of APP with cholesterol. Consistently, intracerebroventricular injection of mAbED-C99 to human wild-type APP transgenic mice markedly increases membrane-associated beta-CTF. All these findings suggest that APP672-699 region is critical for human wild-type APP processing and may provide new clues for the pathogenesis of sporadic AD.

25119316|t|Lenti-GDNF gene therapy protects against Alzheimer's disease-like neuropathology in 3xTg-AD mice and MC65 cells.
25119316|a|AIMS: Glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is emerging as a potent neurotrophic factor with therapeutic potential against a range of neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer's disease (AD). We assayed the effects of GDNF treatment in AD experimental models through gene-therapy procedures. METHODS: Recombinant lentiviral vectors were used to overexpress GDNF gene in hippocampal astrocytes of 3xTg-AD mice in vivo, and also in the MC65 human neuroblastoma that conditionally overexpresses the 99-residue carboxyl-terminal (C99) fragment of the amyloid precursor protein. RESULTS: After 6 months of overexpressing GDNF, 10-month-old 3xTg-AD mice showed preserved learning and memory, while their counterparts transduced with a green fluorescent protein vector showed cognitive loss. GDNF therapy did not significantly reduce amyloid and tau pathology, but rather, induced a potent upregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor that may act in concert with GDNF to protect neurons from atrophy and degeneration. MC65 cells overexpressing GDNF showed an abolishment of oxidative stress and cell death that was at least partially mediated by a reduced presence of intracellular C99 and derived amyloid beta oligomers. CONCLUSIONS: GDNF induced neuroprotection in the AD experimental models used. Lentiviral vectors engineered to overexpress GDNF showed to be safe and effective, both as a potential gene therapy and as a tool to uncover the mechanisms of GDNF neuroprotection, including cross talk between astrocytes and neurons in the injured brain.

25119742|t|MicroRNA-193b is a regulator of amyloid precursor protein in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid derived exosomal microRNA-193b is a biomarker of Alzheimer's disease.
25119742|a|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) has an important function in the generation of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In our previous study, miR-193b was found to be downregulated in the hippocampi of 9-month-old APP/PS1 double-transgenic mice using microRNA (miR) array. In the present study, bioinformatic analyses showed that miR-193b was a miR that was predicted to potentially target the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of APP. Subsequently, the function of miR-193b on APP was studied. The levels of miR-193b, exosomal miR-193b, Abeta, tau, p-tau, HCY and APOE in samples from APP/PS1 double-transgenic mice, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia of Alzheimer-type (DAT) patients, were measured. The results indicated that overexpression of miR-193b could repress the mRNA and protein expression of APP. The miR-193b inhibitor oligonucleotide induced upregulation of APP. Binding sites of miR-193b in the 3'-UTR of APP were identified by luciferase assay. MCI and DAT patients had lower exosomal miR-193b, but not total miR-193b, in the blood as compared with the controls. DAT patients had lower exosomal miR-193b levels in blood as compared with the MCI group. A decreased exosomal miR-193b expression level was additionally observed in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of DAT patients. Negative correlations were found between exosomal miR-193b and Abeta42 in the CSF of DAT patients. In conclusion, these findings showed that miR-193b may function in the development of AD and exosomal miR-193b has potential as a novel, non-invasive, blood-based biomarker of MCI and DAT patients.

25121395|t|Design, synthesis, and evaluation of multitarget-directed selenium-containing clioquinol derivatives for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
25121395|a|A series of selenium-containing clioquinol derivatives were designed, synthesized, and evaluated as multifunctional anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD) agents. In vitro examination showed that several target compounds exhibited activities such as inhibition of metal-induced Abeta aggregation, antioxidative properties, hydrogen peroxide scavenging, and the prevention of copper redox cycling. A parallel artificial membrane permeation assay indicated that selenium-containing clioquinol derivatives possessed significant blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Compound 8a, with a propynylselanyl group linked to the oxine, demonstrated higher hydrogen peroxide scavenging and intracellular antioxidant activity than clioquinol. Furthermore, 8a exhibited significant inhibition of Cu(II)-induced Abeta1-42 aggregation and was capable of disassembling the preformed Cu(II)-induced Abeta aggregates. Therefore, 8a is an excellent multifunctional promising compound for development of novel drugs for AD.

METHODS: Scholars conducted social, behavioral, clinical, or laboratory-based research projects with HIV Vaccine Trials Network investigators over 8 to 16 weeks (track 1) or 9 to 12 months (track 2). We conducted an in-depth, mixed-methods evaluation of the first 2 cohorts (2011-2013) to identify program strengths, areas for improvement, and influence on professional development. RESULTS: A pre-post program assessment demonstrated increases in self-reported knowledge, professional skills, and interest in future HIV vaccine research. During in-depth interviews, scholars reported that a supportive, centrally administered program; available funding; and highly involved mentors and staff were keys to the program's early success. CONCLUSIONS: A multicomponent, mentored research experience that engages medical students from underrepresented communities and is organized within a clinical trials network may expand the pool of diverse public health scientists. Efforts to sustain scholar interest over time and track career trajectories are warranted.

25122912|t|Amyloid precursor protein dimerization and synaptogenic function depend on copper binding to the growth factor-like domain.
25122912|a|Accumulating evidence suggests that the copper-binding amyloid precursor protein (APP) has an essential synaptic function. APP synaptogenic function depends on trans-directed dimerization of the extracellular E1 domain encompassing a growth factor-like domain (GFLD) and a copper-binding domain (CuBD). Here we report the 1.75 A crystal structure of the GFLD in complex with a copper ion bound with high affinity to an extended hairpin loop at the dimerization interface. In coimmunoprecipitation assays copper binding promotes APP interaction, whereas mutations in the copper-binding sites of either the GFLD or CuBD result in a drastic reduction in APP cis-orientated dimerization. We show that copper is essential and sufficient to induce trans-directed dimerization of purified APP. Furthermore, a mixed culture assay of primary neurons with HEK293 cells expressing different APP mutants revealed that APP potently promotes synaptogenesis depending on copper binding to the GFLD. Together, these findings demonstrate that copper binding to the GFLD of APP is required for APP cis-/trans-directed dimerization and APP synaptogenic function. Thus, neuronal activity or disease-associated changes in copper homeostasis likely go along with altered APP synaptic function.

25123396|t|Binding of fullerenes to amyloid beta fibrils: size matters.
25123396|a|Binding affinity of fullerenes C20, C36, C60, C70 and C84 for amyloid beta fibrils is studied by docking and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations with the Amber force field and water model TIP3P. Using the molecular mechanic-Poisson Boltzmann surface area method one can demonstrate that the binding free energy linearly decreases with the number of carbon atoms of fullerene, i.e. the larger is the fullerene size, the higher is the binding affinity. Overall, fullerenes bind to Abeta9-40 fibrils stronger than to Abeta17-42. The number of water molecules trapped in the interior of 12Abeta9-40 fibrils was found to be lower than inside pentamer 5Abeta17-42. C60 destroys Abeta17-42 fibril structure to a greater extent compared to other fullerenes. Our study revealed that the van der Waals interaction dominates over the electrostatic interaction and non-polar residues of amyloid beta peptides play the significant role in interaction with fullerenes providing novel insight into the development of drug candidates against Alzheimer's disease.

25123843|t|Hypoalbuminaemia is associated with mortality in patients undergoing cytoreductive nephrectomy.
25123843|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether poor nutrition is associated with mortality in patients undergoing cytoreductive nephrectomy (CN) for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A multi-institutional review of prospective databases identified 246 patients meeting inclusion criteria who underwent CN for mRCC from 1993 to 2012. Nutritional markers evaluated were: body mass index <18.5 kg/m(2) , serum albumin <3.5 g/dL, or preoperative weight loss of >=5% of body weight. Primary outcomes were overall (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). Secondary outcome was 'early mortality' defined as death at <=6 months of surgery. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method and multivariate analysis using logistic regression was used to test associations between nutritional markers and survival outcomes. RESULTS: In all, 119 patients (median follow-up 17 months) were categorised as having any abnormal nutrition parameter (48%). Hypoalbuminaemia was the only independent predictor of OS and DSS (OS: median 8 vs 23 months, P < 0.001; DSS: 11 vs 33 months, P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, hypoalbuminaemia remained a significant predictor of death for both overall [hazard ratio (HR) 2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4-2.8; P < 0.001) and disease-specific mortality (HR 2.2, 95% CI 1.4-3.3; P < 0.001). Hypoalbuminaemia was also associated with early mortality (overall: P < 0.001 and disease specific: P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Patients with mRCC and hypoalbuminaemia undergoing CN have decreased OS and CSS, and increased risk of all-cause and disease-specific early mortality. As such, serum albumin may help risk stratify patients selected as candidates for CN. Furthermore, future work should evaluate whether nutritional depletion is a modifiable risk factor.

25124924|t|Prolyl isomerase Pin1 in cancer.
25124924|a|Proline-directed phosphorylation is a posttranslational modification that is instrumental in regulating signaling from the plasma membrane to the nucleus, and its dysregulation contributes to cancer development. Protein interacting with never in mitosis A1 (Pin1), which is overexpressed in many types of cancer, isomerizes specific phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro bonds in many substrate proteins, including glycolytic enzyme, protein kinases, protein phosphatases, methyltransferase, lipid kinase, ubiquitin E3 ligase, DNA endonuclease, RNA polymerase, and transcription activators and regulators. This Pin1-mediated isomerization alters the structures and activities of these proteins, thereby regulating cell metabolism, cell mobility, cell cycle progression, cell proliferation, cell survival, apoptosis and tumor development.

25125050|t|Amyloid-beta(1-42) protofibrils stimulate a quantum of secreted IL-1beta despite significant intracellular IL-1beta accumulation in microglia.
25125050|a|Neuroinflammation is a characteristic feature of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. Significant inflammatory markers such as activated microglia and cytokines can be found surrounding the extracellular senile plaques predominantly composed of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta). Several innate immune pathways, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the NLRP3 inflammasome, have been implicated in AD inflammation. Abeta plays a primary role in activating these pathways which likely contributes to the progressive neurodegeneration in AD. In order to better understand the complexities of this interaction we investigated the inflammatory response of primary microglia to Abeta(1-42) protofibrils. Abeta(1-42) protofibrils triggered a time- and MyD88-dependent process that produced tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) mRNA, and intracellular pro and mature forms of IL-1beta protein. The accumulation of both IL-1beta forms indicated that Abeta(1-42) protofibrils were able to prime and activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. Surprisingly, Abeta-induced accumulation of intracellular mature IL-1beta did not translate into greater IL-1beta secretion. Instead, we found that Abeta elicited a quantized burst of secreted IL-1beta and this process occurred even prior to Abeta priming of the microglia suggesting a basal level of either pro or mature IL-1beta in the cultured primary microglia. The IL-1beta secretion burst was rapid but not sustained, yet could be re-evoked with additional Abeta stimulation. The findings from this study demonstrated multiple sites of IL-1beta regulation by Abeta(1-42) protofibrils including TLR/MyD88-mediated priming, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and modulation of the IL-1beta secretory process. These results underscore the wide-ranging effects of Abeta on the innate immune response.

25125370|t|Alternative splicing regulation of APP exon 7 by RBFox proteins.
25125370|a|RBFox proteins are well-known alternative splicing regulators. We have shown previously that during neuronal differentiation of P19 cells induced by all-trans retinoic acid and cell aggregation, RBFox1 shows markedly increased temporal expression. To find its key splicing regulation, we examined the effect of RBFox1 on 33 previously reported and validated neuronal splicing events of P19 cells. We observed that alternative splicing of three genes, specifically, amyloid precursor protein (APP), disks large homolog 3 (DLG3), and G protein, alpha activating activity polypeptide O (GNAO1), was altered by transient RBFox1 expression in HEK293 and HeLa cells. Moreover, an RBFox1 mutant (RBFox1FA) that was unable to bind the target RNA sequence ((U)GCAUG) did not induce these splicing events. APP generates amyloid beta peptides that are involved in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease, and therefore we examined APP alternative splicing regulation by RBFox1 and other splicing regulators. Our results indicated that RBFox proteins promote the skipping of APP exon 7, but not the inclusion of exon 8. We made APP6789 minigenes and observed that two (U)GCAUG sequences, located upstream of exon 7 and in exon 7, functioned to induce skipping of exon 7 by RBFox proteins. Overall, RBFox proteins may shift APP from exon 7 containing isoforms, APP770 and APP751, toward the exon 7 lacking isoform, APP695, which is predominant in neural tissues.

25126727|t|Autophagy in microglia degrades extracellular beta-amyloid fibrils and regulates the NLRP3 inflammasome.
25126727|a|Accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) and resultant inflammation are critical pathological features of Alzheimer disease (AD). Microglia, a primary immune cell in brain, ingests and degrades extracellular Abeta fibrils via the lysosomal system. Autophagy is a catabolic process that degrades native cellular components, however, the role of autophagy in Abeta degradation by microglia and its effects on AD are unknown. Here we demonstrate a novel role for autophagy in the clearance of extracellular Abeta fibrils by microglia and in the regulation of the Abeta-induced NLRP3 (NLR family, pyrin domain containing 3) inflammasome using microglia specific atg7 knockout mice and cell cultures. We found in microglial cultures that Abeta interacts with MAP1LC3B-II via OPTN/optineurin and is degraded by an autophagic process mediated by the PRKAA1 pathway. We anticipate that enhancing microglial autophagy may be a promising new therapeutic strategy for AD.

25129075|t|Alzheimer's disease: early alterations in brain DNA methylation at ANK1, BIN1, RHBDF2 and other loci.
25129075|a|We used a collection of 708 prospectively collected autopsied brains to assess the methylation state of the brain's DNA in relation to Alzheimer's disease (AD). We found that the level of methylation at 71 of the 415,848 interrogated CpGs was significantly associated with the burden of AD pathology, including CpGs in the ABCA7 and BIN1 regions, which harbor known AD susceptibility variants. We validated 11 of the differentially methylated regions in an independent set of 117 subjects. Furthermore, we functionally validated these CpG associations and identified the nearby genes whose RNA expression was altered in AD: ANK1, CDH23, DIP2A, RHBDF2, RPL13, SERPINF1 and SERPINF2. Our analyses suggest that these DNA methylation changes may have a role in the onset of AD given that we observed them in presymptomatic subjects and that six of the validated genes connect to a known AD susceptibility gene network.

25129077|t|Methylomic profiling implicates cortical deregulation of ANK1 in Alzheimer's disease.
25129077|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by progressive neuropathology and cognitive decline. We performed a cross-tissue analysis of methylomic variation in AD using samples from four independent human post-mortem brain cohorts. We identified a differentially methylated region in the ankyrin 1 (ANK1) gene that was associated with neuropathology in the entorhinal cortex, a primary site of AD manifestation. This region was confirmed as being substantially hypermethylated in two other cortical regions (superior temporal gyrus and prefrontal cortex), but not in the cerebellum, a region largely protected from neurodegeneration in AD, or whole blood obtained pre-mortem from the same individuals. Neuropathology-associated ANK1 hypermethylation was subsequently confirmed in cortical samples from three independent brain cohorts. This study represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first epigenome-wide association study of AD employing a sequential replication design across multiple tissues and highlights the power of this approach for identifying methylomic variation associated with complex disease.

25129206|t|Post-mortem 7.0-tesla magnetic resonance study of cortical microinfarcts in neurodegenerative diseases and vascular dementia with neuropathological correlates.
25129206|a|BACKGROUND: Until recently cortical microinfarcts (CMIs) were considered as the invisible lesions in clinical-radiological correlation studies that rely on conventional structural magnetic resonance imaging. The present study investigates the presence of CMIs on 7.0-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in post-mortem brains with different neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred-seventy five post-mortem brains, composed of 37 with pure Alzheimer's disease (AD), 12 with AD associated to cerebral amyloid angiopathy (AD-CAA), 38 with frontotemporal lobar degeneration, 12 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 16 with Lewy body disease (LBD), 21 with progressive supranuclear palsy, 18 with vascular dementia (VaD) and 21 controls were examined. According to their size several types of CMIs were detected on 3 coronal sections of a cerebral hemisphere with 7.0-T MRI and compared to the mean CMI load observed on histological examination of one standard separate coronal section of a cerebral hemisphere at the level of the mamillary body. RESULTS: Overall CMIs were significantly prevalent in those brains with neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases associated to CAA compared to those without CAA. VaD, AD-CAA and LBD brains had significantly more CMIs compared to the controls. While all types of CMIs were increased in VaD and AD-CAA brains, a predominance of the smallest ones was observed in the LBD brains. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that 7.0-T MRI allows the detection of several types of MICs and their contribution to the cognitive decline in different neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases.

25130489|t|Characterizing methyl-bearing side chain contacts and dynamics mediating amyloid beta protofibril interactions using 13C(methyl)-DEST and lifetime line broadening.
25130489|a|Many details pertaining to the formation and interactions of protein aggregates associated with neurodegenerative diseases are invisible to conventional biophysical techniques. We recently introduced (15)N dark-state exchange saturation transfer (DEST) and (15)N lifetime line-broadening to study solution backbone dynamics and position-specific binding probabilities for amyloid beta (Abeta) monomers in exchange with large (2-80 MDa) protofibrillar Abeta aggregates. Here we use (13)C(methyl)DEST and lifetime line-broadening to probe the interactions and dynamics of methyl-bearing side chains in the Abeta-protofibril-bound state. We show that all methyl groups of Abeta40 populate direct-contact bound states with a very fast effective transverse relaxation rate, indicative of side-chain-mediated direct binding to the protofibril surface. The data are consistent with position-specific enhancements of (13)C(methyl)-R2(tethered) values in tethered states, providing further insights into the structural ensemble of the protofibril-bound state.

25130558|t|Diphenyl-diselenide suppresses amyloid-beta peptide in Caenorhabditis elegans model of Alzheimer's disease.
25130558|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common and devastating neurodegenerative disease. The etiology of AD has yet to be fully understood, and common treatments remain largely non-efficacious. The amyloid hypothesis posits that extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposits are the fundamental etiological factor of the disease. The present study tested the organoselenium compound diphenyl-diselenide (PhSe)2, which is characterized by its antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties and has shown efficacy in several neurodegenerative disease models. We employed a transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans AD model to analyze the effects of (PhSe)2 treatment on Abeta peptide-induced toxicity. Chronic exposure to (PhSe)2 attenuated oxidative stress induced by Abeta1-42, with concomitant recovery of associative learning memory in C. elegans. Additionally, (PhSe)2 decreased Abeta1-42 transgene expression, suppressed Abeta1-42 peptide, and downregulated hsp-16.2 by reducing the need for this chaperone under Abeta1-42-induced toxicity. These observations suggest that (PhSe)2 plays an important role in protecting against oxidative stress-induced toxicity, thus representing a promising pharmaceutical modality that attenuates Abeta1-42 expression.

25130656|t|A presenilin 1 mutation in the first case of Alzheimer's disease: revisited.
25130656|a|BACKGROUND: Recently, a single point mutation in the presenilin 1 (PSEN1) gene of the first described Alzheimer's disease (AD) patient Auguste D was reported by Muller and co-workers. However, the sequencing results of the DNA from a 100-year-old tissue contained some uncertainties. METHODS: We heat extracted DNA from an original histological slice of Auguste D's brain and used nested polymerase chain reaction for the amplification of different exons of genes known to be affected in familial forms of AD. RESULTS: Our sequencing analysis did not validate the reported mutation. Furthermore, an extended sequencing analysis of Auguste D's DNA revealed no indication of a nonsynonymous hetero- or homozygous mutation in the exons of APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 genes comprising the already known familial AD mutations. CONCLUSION: Despite the wealth of data from Muller and co-workers, our results emphasize the requirement of more detailed analysis of Auguste D's DNA in future.

25130657|t|Identification of preclinical Alzheimer's disease by a profile of pathogenic proteins in neurally derived blood exosomes: A case-control study.
25130657|a|BACKGROUND: Proteins pathogenic in Alzheimer's disease (AD) were extracted from neurally derived blood exosomes and quantified to develop biomarkers for the staging of sporadic AD. METHODS: Blood exosomes obtained at one time-point from patients with AD (n = 57) or frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (n = 16), and at two time-points from others (n = 24) when cognitively normal and 1 to 10 years later when diagnosed with AD were enriched for neural sources by immunoabsorption. AD-pathogenic exosomal proteins were extracted and quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RESULTS: Mean exosomal levels of total tau, P-T181-tau, P-S396-tau, and amyloid beta 1-42 (Abeta1-42) for AD and levels of P-T181-tau and Abeta1-42 for FTD were significantly higher than for case-controls. Step-wise discriminant modeling incorporated P-T181-tau, P-S396-tau, and Abeta1-42 in AD, but only P-T181-tau in FTD. Classification of 96.4% of AD patients and 87.5% of FTD patients was correct. In 24 AD patients, exosomal levels of P-S396-tau, P-T181-tau, and Abeta1-42 were significantly higher than for controls both 1 to 10 years before and when diagnosed with AD. CONCLUSIONS: Levels of P-S396-tau, P-T181-tau, and Abeta1-42 in extracts of neurally derived blood exosomes predict the development of AD up to 10 years before clinical onset.

25130662|t|SUN11602 has basic fibroblast growth factor-like activity and attenuates neuronal damage and cognitive deficits in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease induced by amyloid beta and excitatory amino acids.
25130662|a|Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF/FGF-2) is known to possess neuroprotective and neurite outgrowth activity properties. In this study, the effects of a novel synthetic compound that mimics the neuroprotective properties of bFGF - SUN11602 - were examined in vitro and in vivo. SUN11602 promoted neurite outgrowth of primarily cultured rat hippocampal neurons. For the in vivo study, an Alzheimer's disease (AD) model with severe damage to the hippocampal tissue was constructed by injecting the hippocampi of rats with aggregated Abeta1-40, followed 48 h later by an injection of ibotenate [an agonist for N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor]. Oral administration of SUN11602 at the midpoint of Abeta1-40 and ibotenate injections attenuated short-term memory impairment in the Y-maze test, as well as spatial learning deficits in the water maze task. In addition, the SUN11602 treatment inhibited the increase of peripheral-type benzodiazepine-binding sites (PTBBS), which are a marker for gliosis. A negative correlation was found between PTBBS numbers and learning capacity in the water maze task. These results suggest that SUN111602 improved memory and learning deficits in the hippocampally lesioned rats by preventing neuronal death and/or promotion of neurite outgrowth. Taken together, these results indicate that SUN11602, a bFGF-like compound with neuroprotective and neurite outgrowth activity, may be beneficial for the treatment of progressive neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.

25130729|t|Conformation-specific antibodies to target amyloid beta oligomers and their application to immunotherapy for Alzheimer's disease.
25130729|a|Amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) oligomers, intermediates of Abeta aggregation, cause cognitive impairment and synaptotoxicity in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Immunotherapy using anti-Abeta antibody is one of the most promising approaches for AD treatment. However, most clinical trials using conventional sequence-specific antibodies have proceeded with difficulty. This is probably due to the unintended removal of the non-pathological monomer and fibrils of Abeta as well as the pathological oligomers by these antibodies that recognize Abeta sequence, which is not involved in synaptotoxicity. Several efforts have been made recently to develop conformation-specific antibodies that target the tertiary structure of Abeta oligomers. Here, we review the recent findings of Abeta oligomers and anti-Abeta antibodies including our own, and discuss their potential as therapeutic and diagnostic tools.

25131002|t|Age-associated evolution of plasmatic amyloid in mouse lemur primates: relationship with intracellular amyloid deposition.
25131002|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder. Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) deposition in the brain is one of its hallmarks, and the measure of plasma Abeta is considered to be a biomarker for anti-amyloid drug efficacy in animal models of AD. However, age-associated plasmatic Abeta modulation in animal models is practically never addressed in the literature. Mouse lemur primates are used as a model of normal and AD-like cerebral aging. Here, we studied the effect of age on plasmatic Abeta in 58 mouse lemurs aged from 1 to 10 years. A subset of animals presented high plasmatic Abeta, and the proportion of animals with high plasmatic Abeta was higher in aged animals as compared with young ones. Histologic evaluation of the brain of some of these animals was carried out to assess extracellular and intracellular amyloid load. In aged lemurs, plasmatic Abeta was negatively correlated with the density of neurons accumulating deposits of Abeta.

25131589|t|Amyloid beta-peptide and Alzheimer's disease.
25131589|a|One of the hallmarks of AD (Alzheimer's disease) is the formation of senile plaques in the brain, which contain fibrils composed of Abeta (amyloid beta-peptide). According to the 'amyloid cascade' hypothesis, the aggregation of Abeta initiates a sequence of events leading to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, neurodegeneration, and on to the main symptom of dementia. However, emphasis has now shifted away from fibrillar forms of Abeta and towards smaller and more soluble 'oligomers' as the main culprit in AD. The present chapter commences with a brief introduction to the disease and its current treatment, and then focuses on the formation of Abeta from the APP (amyloid precursor protein), the genetics of early-onset AD, which has provided strong support for the amyloid cascade hypothesis, and then on the development of new drugs aimed at reducing the load of cerebral Abeta, which is still the main hope for providing a more effective treatment for AD in the future.

25131929|t|Localization of amyloid beta (Abeta1-42) protofibrils in membrane lateral compartments: effect of cholesterol and 7-Ketocholesterol.
25131929|a|Cholesterol plays an important role in the interaction of Alzheimer's amyloid beta (Abeta) with cell membranes, an important event in Abeta-induced cytotoxicity. However, it is not fully understood how cholesterol influences the association of Abeta with membrane lateral compartments. We have shown that by modulating membrane fluidity, cholesterol decreased peptide localization in solid-ordered domains and increased that in liquid-ordered domains. It changed the amount of Abeta associating with liquid-disordered (Ld) phase with different tendencies depending on the composition of heterogeneous membrane systems. 7-Ketocholesterol, an oxidized derivative of cholesterol, majorly enhanced the fluidity of and Abeta interaction with Ld phase. These findings are useful for clarifying the impact of cholesterol and its oxidation in Abeta-induced toxicity.

25133634|t|De novo design of self-assembled hexapeptides as beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide inhibitors.
25133634|a|The ability of peptides to construct specific secondary structures provides a useful function for biomaterial design that cannot be achieved with traditional organic molecules and polymers. Inhibition of amyloid formation is a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Existing peptide-based inhibitors are mainly derived from original amyloid sequences, which have very limited sequence diversity and activity. It is highly desirable to explore other peptide-based inhibitors that are not directly derived from amyloid sequences. Here, we develop a hybrid high-throughput computational method to efficiently screen and design hexapeptide inhibitors against amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregation and toxicity from the first principle. Computationally screened/designed inhibitors are then validated for their inhibition activity using biophysical experiments. We propose and demonstrate a proof-of-concept of the "like-interacts-like" design principle that the self-assembling peptides are able to interact strongly with conformationally similar motifs of Abeta peptides and to competitively reduce Abeta-Abeta interactions, thus preventing Abeta aggregation and Abeta-induced toxicity. Such a de novo design can also be generally applicable to design new peptide inhibitors against other amyloid diseases, beyond traditional peptide inhibitors with homologous sequences to parent amyloid peptides.

25134066|t|Fibril elongation by Abeta(17-42): kinetic network analysis of hybrid-resolution molecular dynamics simulations.
25134066|a|A critical step of beta-amyloid fibril formation is fibril elongation in which amyloid-beta monomers undergo structural transitions to fibrillar structures upon their binding to fibril tips. The atomic detail of the structural transitions remains poorly understood. Computational characterization of the structural transitions is limited so far to short Abeta segments (5-10 aa) owing to the long time scale of Abeta fibril elongation. To overcome the computational time scale limit, we combined a hybrid-resolution model with umbrella sampling and replica exchange molecular dynamics and performed altogether ~1.3 ms of molecular dynamics simulations of fibril elongation for Abeta17-42. Kinetic network analysis of biased simulations resulted in a kinetic model that encompasses all Abeta segments essential for fibril formation. The model not only reproduces key properties of fibril elongation measured in experiments, including Abeta binding affinity, activation enthalpy of Abeta structural transitions and a large time scale gap (taulock/taudock = 10(3)-10(4)) between Abeta binding and its structural transitions, but also reveals detailed pathways involving structural transitions not seen before, namely, fibril formation both in hydrophobic regions L17-A21 and G37-A42 preceding fibril formation in hydrophilic region E22-A30. Moreover, the model identifies as important kinetic intermediates strand-loop-strand (SLS) structures of Abeta monomers, long suspected to be related to fibril elongation. The kinetic model suggests further that fibril elongation arises faster at the fibril tip with exposed L17-A21, rather than at the other tip, explaining thereby unidirectional fibril growth observed previously in experiments.

25134727|t|Amyloid-beta oligomers as a template for secondary amyloidosis in Alzheimer's disease.
25134727|a|Alzheimer's disease is a complex disease characterized by overlapping phenotypes with different neurodegenerative disorders. Oligomers are considered the most toxic species in amyloid pathologies. We examined human AD brain samples using an anti-oligomer antibody generated in our laboratory and detected potential hybrid oligomers composed of amyloid-beta, prion protein, alpha-synuclein, and TDP-43 phosphorylated at serines 409 and 410. These data and in vitro results suggest that Abeta oligomer seeds act as a template for the aggregation of other proteins and generate an overlapping phenotype with other neuronal disorders. Furthermore, these results could explain why anti-amyloid-beta therapy has been unsuccessful.

25134729|t|Phosphorylated tau potentiates Abeta-induced mitochondrial damage in mature neurons.
25134729|a|Tau phosphorylated at the PHF-1 epitope (S396/S404) is likely involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the molecular mechanisms by which tau phosphorylated at these sites negatively impacts neuronal functions are still under scrutiny. Previously, we showed that expression of tau truncated at D421 enhances mitochondrial dysfunction induced by Abeta in cortical neurons. To extend these findings, we expressed tau pseudo-phosphorylated at S396/404 (T42EC) in mature and young cortical neurons and evaluated different aspects of mitochondrial function in response to Abeta. Expression of T42EC did not induce significant changes in mitochondrial morphology, mitochondrial length, or mitochondrial transport, compared to GFP and full-length tau. However, T42EC expression enhanced Abeta-induced mitochondrial membrane potential loss and increased superoxide levels compared to what was observed in mature neurons expressing full-length tau. The same effect was observed in mature neurons that expressed both pseudo-phosphorylated and truncated tau when they were treated with Abeta. Interestingly, the mitochondrial failure induced by Abeta in mature neurons that expressed T42EC, was not observed in young neurons expressing T42EC. These novel findings suggest that phosphorylated tau (PHF-1 epitope) enhances Abeta-induced mitochondrial injury, which contributes to neuronal dysfunction and to the pathogenesis of AD.

25137638|t|Dual effects of familial Alzheimer's disease mutations (D7H, D7N, and H6R) on amyloid beta peptide: correlation dynamics and zinc binding.
25137638|a|Although the N-terminal region of Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides plays dual roles as metal-coordinating sites and conformational modulator, few studies have been performed to explore the effects of mutations at this region on the overall conformational ensemble of Abeta and the binding propensity of metal ions. In this work, we focus on how three familial Alzheimer's disease mutations (D7H, D7N, and H6R) alter the structural characteristics and thermodynamic stabilities of Abeta42 using molecular dynamics simulations. We observe that each mutation displays increased beta-sheet structures in both N and C termini. In particular, both the N terminus and central hydrophobic region of D7H can form stable beta-hairpin structures with its C terminus. The conserved turn structure at Val24-Lys28 in all peptides and Zn2+-bound Abeta42 is confirmed as the common structural motif to nucleate folding of Abeta. Each mutant can significantly increase the solvation free energy and thus enhance the aggregation of Abeta monomers. The correlation dynamics between Abeta(1-16) and Abeta(17-42) fragments are elucidated by linking the domain motions with the corresponding structured conformations. We characterize the different populations of correlated domain motions for each mutant from a more macroscopic perspective, and unexpectedly find that Zn2+-bound Abeta42 ensemble shares the same populations as Abeta42, indicating that the binding of Zn2+ to Abeta follows the conformational selection mechanism, and thus is independent of domain motions, even though the structures of Abeta have been modified at a residue level.

25139534|t|Molecular features and survival outcomes of the intrinsic subtypes within HER2-positive breast cancer.
25139534|a|BACKGROUND: The clinical impact of the biological heterogeneity within HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer is not fully understood. Here, we evaluated the molecular features and survival outcomes of the intrinsic subtypes within HER2+ breast cancer. METHODS: We interrogated The Cancer Genome Atlas (n = 495) and Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) datasets (n = 1730) of primary breast cancers for molecular data derived from DNA, RNA and protein, and determined intrinsic subtype. Clinical HER2 status was defined according to American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines or DNA copy-number aberration by single nucleotide polymorphism arrays. Cox models tested the prognostic significance of each variable in patients not treated with trastuzumab (n = 1711). RESULTS: Compared with clinically HER2 (cHER2)-negative breast cancer, cHER2+ breast cancer had a higher frequency of the HER2-enriched (HER2E) subtype (47.0% vs 7.1%) and a lower frequency of Luminal A (10.7% vs 39.0%) and Basal-like (14.1% vs 23.4%) subtypes. The likelihood of cHER2-positivity in HER2E, Luminal B, Basal-like and Luminal A subtypes was 64.6%, 20.0%, 14.4% and 7.3%, respectively. Within each subtype, only 0.3% to 3.9% of genes were found differentially expressed between cHER2+ and cHER2-negative tumors. Within cHER2+ tumors, HER2 gene and protein expression was statistically significantly higher in the HER2E and Basal-like subtypes than either luminal subtype. Neither cHER2 status nor the new 10-subtype copy number-based classification system (IntClust) added independent prognostic value to intrinsic subtype. CONCLUSIONS: When the intrinsic subtypes are taken into account, cHER2-positivity does not translate into large changes in the expression of downstream signaling pathways, nor does it affect patient survival in the absence of HER2 targeting.

25139672|t|CSF levels of Abeta1-38/Abeta1-40/Abeta1-42 and (11)C PiB-PET studies in three clinical variants of primary progressive aphasia and Alzheimer's disease.
25139672|a|Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a cognitive syndrome characterized by progressive and isolated language impairments due to neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, an international group of experts published a Consensus Classification of the three PPA clinical variants (naPPA, svPPA and lvPPA). We analyzed 24 patients with PPA by cognitive functions, neuroimaging (MRI, (99 m)Tc ECD-SPECT, (11)C PiB-PET and FDG-PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis (ptau-181, Abeta1-42, Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-38), to elucidate relationships between neuroimaging studies and biochemical findings in the three PPA clinical variants. Cognitive and speech functions were measured by mini-mental state examination and standard language test of aphasia. The patients with lvPPA showed significant decreases in CSF Abeta1-42 and ratios of Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42/Abeta1-38, and significant increases in CSF ptau-181 and ratios of ptau-181/Abeta1-42 and ptau-181/Abeta1-38; these findings were similar to those of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We observed a higher frequency of the ApoE epsilon4 allele in the lvPPA patients relative to the two other PPA variants. In (11)C PiB-PET of lvPPA patients, PiB positive findings were detected in cortices of frontal, temporal and parietal lobes and the posterior cingulate, where massive Abeta may accumulate due to AD. Our results of AD-CSF markers including Abeta1-38 and (11)C PiB-PET in the lvPPA patients demonstrate a common pathological mechanism with the occurrence of AD.

25140433|t|Dynamical phase transitions reveal amyloid-like states on protein folding landscapes.
25140433|a|Developing an understanding of protein misfolding processes presents a crucial challenge for unlocking the mysteries of human disease. In this article, we present our observations of beta-sheet-rich misfolded states on a number of protein dynamical landscapes investigated through molecular dynamics simulation and Markov state models. We employ a nonequilibrium statistical mechanical theory to identify the glassy states in a protein's dynamics, and we discuss the nonnative, beta-sheet-rich states that play a distinct role in the slowest dynamics within seven protein folding systems. We highlight the fundamental similarity between these states and the amyloid structures responsible for many neurodegenerative diseases, and we discuss potential consequences for mechanisms of protein aggregation and intermolecular amyloid formation.

25141215|a|Based on electronic structure calculations we propose that particular small-sized organic molecules - donor-acceptor substituted phenyl polymethines - can be used as two-photon diagnostic probes for non-invasive imaging of amyloid oligomers and fibrils, which are often referred to as the "early signatures" of Alzheimer's disease.

25142005|t|Specific aromatic foldamers potently inhibit spontaneous and seeded Abeta42 and Abeta43 fibril assembly.
25142005|a|Amyloid fibrils are self-propagating entities that spread pathology in several devastating disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD, amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides form extracellular plaques that contribute to cognitive decline. One potential therapeutic strategy is to develop inhibitors that prevent Abeta misfolding into proteotoxic conformers. Here, we design specific aromatic foldamers, synthetic polymers with an aromatic salicylamide (Sal) or 3-amino benzoic acid (Benz) backbone, short length (four repetitive units), basic arginine (Arg), lysine (Lys) or citrulline (Cit) side chains, and various N- and C-terminal groups that prevent spontaneous and seeded Abeta fibrillization. Ac-Sal-(Lys-Sal)3-CONH2 and Sal-(Lys-Sal)3-CONH2 selectively inhibited Abeta42 fibrillization, but were ineffective against Abeta43, an overlooked species that is highly neurotoxic and frequently deposited in AD brains. By contrast, (Arg-Benz)4-CONH2 and (Arg-Sal)3-(Cit-Sal)-CONH2 prevented spontaneous and seeded Abeta42 and Abeta43 fibrillization. Importantly, (Arg-Sal)3-(Cit-Sal)-CONH2 inhibited formation of toxic Abeta42 and Abeta43 oligomers and proteotoxicity. None of these foldamers inhibited Sup35 prionogenesis, but Sal-(Lys-Sal)3-CONH2 delayed aggregation of fused in sarcoma (FUS), an RNA-binding protein with a prion-like domain connected with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. We establish that inhibitors of Abeta42 fibrillization do not necessarily inhibit Abeta43 fibrillization. Moreover, (Arg-Sal)3-(Cit-Sal)-CONH2 inhibits formation of toxic Abeta conformers and seeding activity, properties that could have therapeutic utility.

25143073|t|Ethnic comparison of pharmacokinetics of (18)F-florbetaben, a PET tracer for beta-amyloid imaging, in healthy Caucasian and Japanese subjects.
25143073|a|PURPOSE: (18)F-Florbetaben is a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer indicated for imaging cerebral beta-amyloid deposition in adult patients with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for Alzheimer's disease and other causes of cognitive decline. The present study examined ethnic comparability of the plasma pharmacokinetics, which is the input to the brain, between Caucasian and Japanese subjects. METHODS: Two identical phase I trials were performed in 18 German and 18 Japanese healthy volunteers to evaluate the plasma pharmacokinetics of a single dose of 300 MBq (18)F-florbetaben, either of low (<=5 mug, LD) or high (50-55 mug, HD) mass dose. Pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated based on the total (18)F radioactivity measurements in plasma followed by metabolite analysis using radio-HPLC. RESULTS: The pharmacokinetics of (18)F-florbetaben was characterized by a rapid elimination from plasma. The dose-normalized areas under the curve of (18)F-florbetaben in plasma as an indicator of the input to the brain were comparable between Germans (LD: 0.38 min/l, HD: 0.55 min/l) and Japanese (LD: 0.35 min/l, HD: 0.45 min/l) suggesting ethnic similarity, and the mass dose effect was minimal. A polar metabolite fraction was the main radiolabelled degradation product in plasma and was also similar between the doses and the ethnic groups. CONCLUSION: Absence of a difference in the pharmacokinetics of (18)F-florbetaben in Germans and Japanese has warranted further global development of the PET imaging agent.

25143627|t|Activation of TRPML1 clears intraneuronal Abeta in preclinical models of HIV infection.
25143627|a|Antiretroviral therapy extends the lifespan of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, but many survivors develop premature impairments in cognition. These residual cognitive impairments may involve aberrant deposition of amyloid beta-peptides (Abeta). By unknown mechanisms, Abeta accumulates in the lysosomal and autophagic compartments of neurons in the HIV-infected brain. Here we identify the molecular events evoked by the HIV coat protein gp120 that facilitate the intraneuronal accumulation of Abeta. We created a triple transgenic gp120/APP/PS1 mouse that recapitulates intraneuronal deposition of Abeta in a manner reminiscent of the HIV-infected brain. In cultured neurons, we found that the HIV coat protein gp120 increased the transcriptional expression of BACE1 through repression of PPARgamma, and increased APP expression by promoting interaction of the translation-activating RBP heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C with APP mRNA. APP and BACE1 were colocalized into stabilized membrane microdomains, where the beta-cleavage of APP and Abeta formation were enhanced. Abeta-peptides became localized to lysosomes that were engorged with sphingomyelin and calcium. Stimulating calcium efflux from lysosomes with a TRPM1 agonist promoted calcium efflux, luminal acidification, and cleared both sphingomyelin and Abeta from lysosomes. These findings suggest that therapeutics targeted to reduce lysosomal pH in neurodegenerative conditions may protect neurons by facilitating the clearance of accumulated sphingolipids and Abeta-peptides.

25144717|t|Amyloid-beta induces NLRP1-dependent neuronal pyroptosis in models of Alzheimer's disease.
25144717|a|Increasing evidence has shown the aberrant expression of inflammasome-related proteins in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain; these proteins, including NLRP1 inflammasome, are implicated in the execution of inflammatory response and pyroptotic death. Although current data are associated NLRP1 genetic variants with AD, the involvement of NLRP1 inflammasome in AD pathogenesis is still unknown. Using APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice, we found that cerebral NLRP1 levels were upregulated. Our in vitro studies further showed that increased NLRP1-mediated caspase-1-dependent 'pyroptosis' in cultured cortical neurons in response to amyloid-beta. Moreover, we employed direct in vivo infusion of non-viral small-interfering RNA to knockdown NLRP1 or caspase-1 in APPswe/PS1dE9 brain, and discovered that these NLRP1 or caspase-1 deficiency mice resulted in significantly reduced neuronal pyroptosis and reversed cognitive impairments. Taken together, our findings indicate an important role for NLRP1/caspase-1 signaling in AD progression, and point to the modulation of NLRP1 inflammasome as a promising strategy for AD therapy.

25144803|t|Immunoprecipitation of amyloid fibrils by the use of an antibody that recognizes a generic epitope common to amyloid fibrils.
25144803|a|Amyloid fibrils are associated with many maladies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The isolation of amyloids from natural materials is very challenging because the extreme structural stability of amyloid fibrils makes it difficult to apply conventional protein science protocols to their purification. A protocol to isolate and detect amyloids is desired for the diagnosis of amyloid diseases and for the identification of new functional amyloids. Our aim was to develop a protocol to purify amyloid from organisms, based on the particular characteristics of the amyloid fold, such as its resistance to proteolysis and its capacity to be recognized by specific conformational antibodies. We used a two-step strategy with proteolytic digestion as the first step followed by immunoprecipitation using the amyloid conformational antibody LOC. We tested the efficacy of this method using as models amyloid fibrils produced in vitro, tissue extracts from C. elegans that overexpress Abeta peptide, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients diagnosed with AD. We were able to immunoprecipitate Abeta(1-40) amyloid fibrils, produced in vitro and then added to complex biological extracts, but not alpha-synuclein and gelsolin fibrils. This method was useful for isolating amyloid fibrils from tissue homogenates from a C. elegans AD model, especially from aged worms. Although we were able to capture picogram quantities of Abeta(1-40) amyloid fibrils produced in vitro when added to complex biological solutions, we could not detect any Abeta amyloid aggregates in CSF from AD patients. Our results show that although immunoprecipitation using the LOC antibody is useful for isolating Abeta(1-40) amyloid fibrils, it fails to capture fibrils of other amyloidogenic proteins, such as alpha-synuclein and gelsolin. Additional research might be needed to improve the affinity of these amyloid conformational antibodies for an array of amyloid fibrils without compromising their selectivity before application of this protocol to the isolation of amyloids.

Methods used were clinical description with laboratory analyses, repeated electroencephalogram, cerebral computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging studies and details on neuropathological work-up. Neuropathological examination excluded Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. By contrast other neurodegenerative changes combining Alzheimer-type pathology and Lewy body pathology were detected as the most likely substrate of neurological symptoms. Dementia with Lewy bodies should be included in the differential diagnosis in individuals presenting with rapidly progressive dementia.

25145933|t|Inactivation of integrin-beta1 prevents the development of polycystic kidney disease after the loss of polycystin-1.
25145933|a|Dysregulation of polycystin-1 (PC1) leads to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), a disorder characterized by the formation of multiple bilateral renal cysts, the progressive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM), and the development of tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Correspondingly, cystic epithelia express higher levels of integrins (ECM receptors that control various cellular responses, such as cell proliferation, migration, and survival) that are characteristically altered in cystic cells. To determine whether the altered expression of ECM and integrins could establish a pathologic autostimulatory loop, we tested the role of integrin-beta1 in vitro and on the cystic development of ADPKD in vivo. Compared with wild-type cells, PC1-depleted immortalized renal collecting duct cells had higher levels of integrin-beta1 and fibronectin and displayed increased integrin-mediated signaling in the presence of Mn(2+). In mice, conditional inactivation of integrin-beta1 in collecting ducts resulted in a dramatic inhibition of Pkd1-dependent cystogenesis with a concomitant suppression of fibrosis and preservation of normal renal function. Our data provide genetic evidence that a functional integrin-beta1 is required for the early events leading to renal cystogenesis in ADPKD and suggest that the integrin signaling pathway may be an effective therapeutic target for slowing disease progression.

25149907|t|Retinal macroglia changes in a triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
25149907|a|The retinas of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and transgenic AD animal models display amyloid beta deposits and degeneration of ganglion cells. Little is known, however, about the glial changes in the AD retina. The present study used a triple transgenic mouse model (3xTG-AD), which carries mutated human amyloid precursor protein, tau, and presenilin 1 genes and closely mimics the human brain pathology, to investigate retinal glial changes in AD. AD cognitive symptoms are known to begin in the 3xTG-AD mice at four months of age but plaques and tangles are not seen until six to twelve months. Muller cells in 3xTG-AD animals were GFAP-positive, indicating activation, at the earliest time point investigated, nine months. Astrocyte activation was also suggested in the 3xTG-AD mice by an apparent increase in size and process number. Another glial marker, S100, was expressed by astrocytes in both the non-transgenic (NTG) controls and 3xTG-AD retinas. Labeling was predominantly nuclear in nine month non-transgenic (NTG) control mice but was also seen in the cytoplasm and processes at 18 months of age. Interestingly, the nuclear localization was not as prominent in the 3xTG-AD retina even at nine months with labeling observed in astrocyte processes. The diffusion of S100 suggests the possible secretion of this protein, as is seen in the brain, with age and, more profoundly, associated with AD. Several dense, abnormally shaped, opaque structures were noted in all 3xTG-AD mice investigated. These structures, which were enveloped by GFAP and S100-positive astrocytes and Muller cells, were positive for amyloid beta, suggesting that they are amyloid plaques. Staining control retinas with amyloid showed similar structures in 30% of NTG animals but these were fewer in number and not associated with glial activation. The results herein indicate retinal glia activation in the 3xTG-AD mouse retina.

25150118|t|Oligonol improves memory and cognition under an amyloid beta(25-35)-induced Alzheimer's mouse model.
25150118|a|Alzheimer's disease is an age-dependent progressive neurodegenerative disorder that results in impairments of memory and cognitive function. It is hypothesized that oligonol has ameliorative effects on memory impairment and reduced cognitive functions in mice with Alzheimer's disease induced by amyloid beta(25-35) (Abeta(25-35)) injection. The protective effect of an oligonol against Abeta(25-35)-induced memory impairment was investigated in an in vivo Alzheimer's mouse model. The aggregation of Abeta25-35 was induced by incubation at 37 C for 3 days before injection into mice brains (5 nmol/mouse), and then oligonol was orally administered at 100 and 200 mg/kg of body weight for 2 weeks. Memory and cognition were observed in T-maze, object recognition, and Morris water maze tests. The group injected with Abeta(25-35) showed impairments in both recognition and memory. However, novel object recognition and new route awareness abilities were dose dependently improved by the oral administration of oligonol. In addition, the results of the Morris water maze test indicated that oligonol exerted protective activity against cognitive impairment induced by Abeta(25-35). Furthermore, nitric oxide formation and lipid peroxidation were significantly elevated by Abeta(25-35), whereas oligonol treatment significantly decreased nitric oxide formation and lipid peroxidation in the brain, liver, and kidneys. The present results suggest that oligonol improves Abeta(25-35)-induced memory deficit and cognition impairment.

25150405|t|Global discrepancies in the diagnosis, surgical management, and investigation of femoroacetabular impingement.
25150405|a|PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to review the global pattern of surgical management of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI), particularly in diagnosis, outcome measurement, and management. METHODS: We performed a systematic search in duplicate for surgical studies addressing FAI published up to June 2013. Study parameters, including sample size, study location, surgical intervention technique, diagnostic imaging, outcome measures used, sex distribution, and level of evidence, were obtained. The number of trials and cumulative sample size were analyzed. The surgical interventions, sex distribution, outcome measures, and diagnostic imaging used were compared between geographic regions. RESULTS: We identified 105 studies reporting surgical interventions for FAI. Most studies were completed in North America (52 studies, 3,629 patients) and in Europe (44 studies, 3,745 patients). Asia (3 studies, 49 patients) and Oceania (6 studies, 394 patients) had smaller contributions. There were no studies from South America or Africa. Most research performed in North America, Europe, and Oceania investigated arthroscopic FAI surgery (55% of studies) followed by surgical dislocation (33%), and miniopen (15%) and combined approaches (8%). Methods of diagnosis were consistent worldwide, with radiography being the mainstay of diagnosis (84% of studies). Case series were the most common type of study globally (75% of studies). Outcome measures varied by region; Harris hip scores were most common in North America, Oceania, and Asia, whereas Non-Arthritic Hip Scores and Western Ontario McMaster scores predominated in Europe. CONCLUSIONS: Global surgical trends for FAI show a predominance of North American and European studies, studies of lower level evidence, and inconsistent use of outcome measures. However, patterns of diagnostic imaging, sex proportions, and predominance of arthroscopic techniques are consistent worldwide. Future research should focus on development of reliable validated outcome measures and international collaboration to conduct high-quality research and improve our understanding of FAI diagnosis and management. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, systematic review of Level I-IV studies.

25150572|t|Beta amyloid-induced upregulation of death receptor 6 accelerates the toxic effect of N-terminal fragment of amyloid precursor protein.
25150572|a|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays essential roles in the development of the Alzheimer's disease. Although full-length APP has been thoroughly studied, the role of the cleavage fragments especially the N-terminal fragments (N-APPs) in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis was still elusive. In this study, we demonstrated that application of recombinant APP18-286 could enhance beta amyloid (Abeta)-induced neuronal injuries which were related to the activation of apoptosis proteins. Abeta treatment could induce a slight increase of N-APPs release. In addition, expression of death receptor 6 (DR6) was increased in Abeta-treated neurons and APP transgenic mice. Moreover, the effect of APP18-286 on Abeta-induced injuries could be suppressed by the application of recombinant DR641-341 and DR6 antibody. Furthermore, pull-down assay revealed that APP18-286 could bind both exogenous and endogenous DR6. Abeta promoted APP18-286 targeting to neuron which was accompanied with the increase of DR6 expression, whereas downregulation of DR6 by interference RNA could alleviate the binding of N-APPs to neuron and also suppressed Abeta-dependent toxic effect with N-APPs. These results suggested that APP N-terminal fragments might play neurotoxic roles in Abeta-induced neuronal injuries through cell surface DR6.

25150730|t|Temporal evolution of biomarkers and cognitive markers in the asymptomatic, MCI, and dementia stage of Alzheimer's disease.
25150730|a|BACKGROUND: We investigated the pattern of disease progression in the asymptomatic, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: We selected 284 subjects with AD pathology, defined as abnormal levels of amyloid beta 1-42 (Abeta1-42) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Disease outcome measures included six biomarkers and five cognitive markers. We compared differences in baseline measures and decline over 4 years between the AD stages and tested whether these changes differed from subjects, without AD pathology (N = 132). RESULTS: CSF Abeta1-42 reached the maximum abnormality level in the asymptomatic stage and tau in the MCI stage. The imaging and cognitive markers started to decline in the asymptomatic stage, and decline accelerated with advancing clinical stage. CONCLUSION: This study provides further evidence for a temporal evolution of AD biomarkers. Our findings may be helpful to determine stage specific outcome measures for clinical trials.

25150732|t|Prevalence of dementia in the oldest old: the Monzino 80-plus population based study.
25150732|a|BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies commonly include too few of the oldest old to provide accurate prevalence rates of dementia in older age groups. Estimates of the number of those affected, necessary for healthcare planning, are thus flawed. The objective is to estimate the prevalence of dementia and levels of dementia severity in a very large population of oldest old and to investigate the relation between age and dementia prevalence in the extreme ages. METHODS: The Monzino 80-plus is a population-based study among residents 80 years or older in Varese province, Italy. Dementia cases were identified using a one-phase design. The survey was conducted in the participant's place of residence, whether home or institution. Both participants and informants were interviewed. Information was available for 2504 of the 2813 residents (89%). RESULTS: In all, 894 individuals (714 women and 180 men) met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fourth edition) criteria for dementia, for a standardized prevalence of 25.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 23.4, 27.2%), 28.5% (95% CI: 26.2, 30.9) in women and 18.6% (95% CI: 15.2, 21.9) in men. Age-specific prevalence estimates of dementia increased with age from 15.7% at age 80 to 84 years to 65.9% at age 100 years and higher. For women, prevalence continued to rise after age 100 years, from 64.8% at age 100 to 101 years to 76.1% at age 102 to 107 years. After age 85 years prevalence rates tended to rise linearly, on average 2.6% per year in women and 1.8% in men. About 80% of the cases were moderate or severe. The frequency of mild dementia decreased and that of severe dementia increased with age. CONCLUSION: One-quarter of 80-plus year olds are affected by dementia, mostly moderate or severe. Prevalence rates of dementia do not level off, but continue to rise gradually even in the extreme ages.

25150736|t|The clinical use of cerebrospinal fluid biomarker testing for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis: a consensus paper from the Alzheimer's Biomarkers Standardization Initiative.
25150736|a|BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers beta-amyloid 1-42 (Abeta1-42), also expressed as Abeta1-42:Abeta1-40 ratio, T-tau, and P-tau181P, have proven diagnostic accuracy for mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD). How to use, interpret, and disclose biomarker results drives the need for standardization. METHODS: Previous Alzheimer's Biomarkers Standardization Initiative meetings discussed preanalytical issues affecting Abeta1-42 and tau in CSF. This second round of consensus meetings focused on issues related to clinical use of AD CSF biomarkers. RESULTS: Consensus was reached that lumbar puncture for AD CSF biomarker analysis be considered as a routine clinical test in patients with early-onset dementia, at the prodromal stage or with atypical AD. Moreover, consensus was reached on which biomarkers to use, how results should be interpreted, and potential confounding factors. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in Abeta1-42, T-tau, and P-tau181P allow diagnosis of AD in its prodromal stage. Conversely, having all three biomarkers in the normal range rules out AD. Intermediate conditions require further patient follow-up.

25151011|t|Amyloid beta receptors responsible for neurotoxicity and cellular defects in Alzheimer's disease.
25151011|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease. Although a major cause of AD is the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide that induces neuronal loss and cognitive impairments, our understanding of its neurotoxic mechanisms is limited. Recent studies have identified putative Abeta-binding receptors that mediate Abeta neurotoxicity in cells and models of AD. Once Abeta interacts with a receptor, a toxic signal is transduced into neurons, resulting in cellular defects including endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, Abeta can also be internalized into neurons through unidentified Abeta receptors and induces malfunction of subcellular organelles, which explains some part of Abeta neurotoxicity. Understanding the neurotoxic signaling initiated by Abeta-receptor binding and cellular defects provide insight into new therapeutic windows for AD. In the present review, we summarize the findings on Abeta-binding receptors and the neurotoxicity of oligomeric Abeta.

25152461|t|MicroRNA-135a and -200b, potential Biomarkers for Alzheimer s disease, regulate beta secretase and amyloid precursor protein.
25152461|a|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) and beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (BACE-1) play important roles in the generation of Alzheimer s disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. In the present study, microRNA (miR) microarray was used to analyze the miR expression profiles in the hippocampi from APP/PS1 transgenic and wild type mice. The miRs with significant alteration and putative targets on APP or BACE-1 were retrieved (miR-135a, -200b and -429). The deregulations of these miRs were confirmed in mice and further verified in AD patient samples by qPCR. Primary mouse hippocampal neurons, SH-SY5Y and HEK293 cells were used to study the function of miRs on APP and BACE-1. We found that miR-135a, which was downregulated significantly in hippocampi from APP/PS1 transgenic mice compared with the wild type control, directly interacted with the 3'-UTR of BACE-1 and repressed its expression and activity. On the other hand, miR-200b and -429, which were downregulated significantly in hippocampi from APP/PS1 transgenic mice compared with the wild type control, targeted the 3'-UTR of APP and repressed its expression. Furthermore, Abeta42 could downregulate miR-200b expression which may generate a vicious cycle resulted in accumulating Abeta42. The levels of miR-135a and -200b in the serum of DAT group were significantly lower than that of control groups (P<0.05). The serum miR-200b level of MCI group was higher than that of DAT group (P<0.05) and lower than that of control group (P<0.05). We also found decreased miR-135a and -200b levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of DAT group compared with the control group (P<0.05). In conclusion, these findings showed that miR-135a, -200b and -429 may take part in the progress of AD; miR-200b was of great potential as noninvasive and easily detected blood-based biomarkers of MCI and DAT patients.

25153942|t|Interactions between amyloid-beta and Tau fragments promote aberrant aggregates: implications for amyloid toxicity.
25153942|a|We have investigated at the oligomeric level interactions between Abeta(25-35) and Tau(273-284), two important fragments of the amyloid-beta and Tau proteins, implicated in Alzheimer's disease. We are able to directly observe the coaggregation of these two peptides by probing the conformations of early heteroligomers and the macroscopic morphologies of the aggregates. Ion-mobility experiment and theoretical modeling indicate that the interactions of the two fragments affect the self-assembly processes of both peptides. Tau(273-284) shows a high affinity to form heteroligomers with existing Abeta(25-35) monomer and oligomers in solution. The configurations and characteristics of the heteroligomers are determined by whether the population of Abeta(25-35) or Tau(273-284) is dominant. As a result, two types of aggregates are observed in the mixture with distinct morphologies and dimensions from those of pure Abeta(25-35) fibrils. The incorporation of some Tau into beta-rich Abeta(25-35) oligomers reduces the aggregation propensity of Abeta(25-35) but does not fully abolish fibril formation. On the other hand, by forming complexes with Abeta(25-35), Tau monomers and dimers can advance to larger oligomers and form granular aggregates. These heteroligomers may contribute to toxicity through loss of normal function of Tau or inherent toxicity of the aggregates themselves.

25155386|a|Alzheimer's disease is a persistent neurodegenerative disorder of elderly characterized clinically by irreversible loss of memory due to accumulation of amyloid beta peptides within the amyloid plaques. We report the parallel synthesis and screening results of diverse substituted di-thiazole piperazine benzamides.

25155658|t|Accuracy of brain amyloid detection in clinical practice using cerebrospinal fluid beta-amyloid 42: a cross-validation study against amyloid positron emission tomography.
25155658|a|IMPORTANCE: Before adding cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers to the diagnostic workup of Alzheimer disease, it needs to be determined whether CSF biomarkers analyzed in routine clinical practice can reliably predict cortical beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition. OBJECTIVES: To study whether CSF biomarkers, analyzed consecutively in routine clinical practice during 2 years, can predict cortical Abeta deposition and to establish a threshold for Abeta42 abnormality. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study (The Swedish BioFINDER [Biomarkers For Identifying Neurodegenerative Disorders Early and Reliably] Study) was conducted at 3 memory clinics. It involved consecutively referred, nondemented patients with mild cognitive symptoms (original cohort, n = 118; validation cohort, n = 38). EXPOSURES: Amyloid positron emission tomography imaging with 18F-flutemetamol. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Analyses of CSF Abeta42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (INNOTEST) in clinical samples. RESULTS: The agreement between Abeta classification with CSF Abeta42 and 18F-flutemetamol positron emission tomography was very high (kappa = 0.85). Of all the cases, 92% were classified identically using an Abeta42 cutoff of 647 pg/mL or less. Cerebrospinal fluid Abeta42 predicted abnormal cortical Abeta deposition accurately (odds ratio, 165; 95% CI, 39-693; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.88-0.97). The association was independent of age, sex, APOE (apolipoprotein E) genotype, hippocampal volume, memory, and global cognition (adjusted odds ratio, 169; 95% CI, 25-1143). Using ratios of CSF Abeta42:tau or Abeta42:phosphorylated tau did not improve the prediction of Abeta deposition. Cerebrospinal fluid Abeta42 correlated significantly with Abeta deposition in all cortical regions. The highest correlations were in regions with high 18F-flutemetamol retention (eg, posterior cingulum and precuneus, r = -0.72). 18F-flutemetamol retention, but not CSF Abeta42, correlated significantly with global cognition (r = -0.32), memory function (r = -0.28), and hippocampal volume (r = -0.36) among those with abnormal Abeta deposition. Finally, the CSF Abeta42 cutoff derived from the original cohort (<=647 pg/mL) had an equally high agreement (95%; kappa = 0.89) with 18F-flutemetamol positron emission tomography in the validation cohort. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Cerebrospinal fluid Abeta42 analyzed consecutively in routine clinical practice at an accredited laboratory can be used with high accuracy to determine whether a patient has normal or increased cortical Abeta deposition and so can be valuable for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer disease. Abnormal 18F-flutemetamol retention levels correlate with disease stage in patients with mild cognitive symptoms, but this is not the case for CSF Abeta42 measurements.

25156574|t|Intravenous immunoglobulin reduces tau pathology and preserves neuroplastic gene expression in the 3xTg mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
25156574|a|Despite recent negative results of the Gammaglobulin Alzheimer's Partnership (GAP) trial, the good tolerability to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and its potential benefit for patient subpopulations have highlighted the importance of understanding IVIG's mechanism of action. IVIG contains antibodies to amyloid suggesting an amyloid clearance mechanism. However, the suboptimal results of the amyloid immunotherapy trials suggest an additional mechanism. Therefore, we tested whether IVIG alters the expression of tau neurofibrillary tangle (NFT)-like deposits within hippocampal CA1 neurons of the 3xTg mouse model of AD. Three-month-old mice were treated intravenously with IVIG (10%, 400 mg/kg) or placebo (10% BSA/saline) every two weeks for either three or six months. At sacrifice, plasma was isolated for gene expression profiling and brains were processed for immunohistochemistry using the AT-180 antibody, which recognizes hyperphosphorylated tau in NFTs. Stereologic analysis of CA1 neurons following three months of treatment revealed no difference in AT-180+ neuron number but a significant 15-20% decrease in AT-180 intraneuronal optical density with IVIG compared to placebo. By contrast, the number of AT-180+ CA1 neurons was reduced by 25-30% following six months of IVIG treatment compared to placebo. Expression profiling studies showed that IVIG treatment resulted in a significant 40-50% increase in plasma levels of genes regulating neuronal cytoskeletal plasticity function and calcium-mediated signaling compared to placebo. Moreover, several transcripts encoding protein phosphatase subunits were 40-50% higher in IVIG-treated mice. Hence, IVIG reduces hippocampal NFT pathology in the 3xTg mouse through a mechanism that may involve preservation of neuronal plasticity and tau phosphorylation homeostasis.

25156643|t|Diagnostic impact of CSF biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease in a tertiary memory clinic.
25156643|a|BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess the impact of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease on decision making and patient management in a tertiary memory clinic. METHODS: We included all patients, for 1 year, visiting the VUmc Alzheimer Center for cognitive screening. Neurologists completed questionnaires before and after CSF disclosure. We assessed the change of diagnosis, diagnostic confidence, and impact on patient management. RESULTS: A total of 438 patients (age 63 +- 8 years, 39% women) were included, of whom 351 (80%) underwent lumbar puncture. After the disclosure of CSF 23/351 diagnoses (7%) were changed. Diagnostic confidence increased from 84% to 89% (P < .001). There were consequences for management in 44/351 patients (13%) with CSF, and 13/87 patients (15%) because of unavailable CSF. There was no effect of age on these results. CONCLUSIONS: CSF biomarkers aid clinicians with decision making during diagnostic work-up of cognitive disorders. This study may be useful for developing guidelines for the implementation of CSF biomarkers in daily practice.

25157105|t|Methylene blue modulates beta-secretase, reverses cerebral amyloidosis, and improves cognition in transgenic mice.
25157105|a|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) proteolysis is required for production of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides that comprise beta-amyloid plaques in the brains of patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). Here, we tested whether the experimental agent methylene blue (MB), used for treatment of methemoglobinemia, might improve AD-like pathology and behavioral deficits. We orally administered MB to the aged transgenic PSAPP mouse model of cerebral amyloidosis and evaluated cognitive function and cerebral amyloid pathology. Beginning at 15 months of age, animals were gavaged with MB (3 mg/kg) or vehicle once daily for 3 months. MB treatment significantly prevented transgene-associated behavioral impairment, including hyperactivity, decreased object recognition, and defective spatial working and reference memory, but it did not alter nontransgenic mouse behavior. Moreover, brain parenchymal and cerebral vascular beta-amyloid deposits as well as levels of various Abeta species, including oligomers, were mitigated in MB-treated PSAPP mice. These effects occurred with inhibition of amyloidogenic APP proteolysis. Specifically, beta-carboxyl-terminal APP fragment and beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 protein expression and activity were attenuated. Additionally, treatment of Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing human wild-type APP with MB significantly decreased Abeta production and amyloidogenic APP proteolysis. These results underscore the potential for oral MB treatment against AD-related cerebral amyloidosis by modulating the amyloidogenic pathway.

25158248|t|Effect of the beta secretase-1 inhibitor on the amyloid C-terminal fragment of amyloid precursor protein processing in a hyperphosphorylated tau rat model.
25158248|a|The amyloid C-terminal fragment (betaCTF) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is the cleaved component of APP by beta secretase-1 (BACE1), which shows similar neurotoxicity as amyloid beta (Abeta) in many ways. Evidence suggested that in addition to Abeta, betaCTF might also participate in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In recent years, the relationship between betaCTF processing and hyperphosphorylated tau has attracted increasing research attention. In this study, we established an animal model of tau hyperphosphorylation with okadaic acid (OA) treatment, and analyzed betaCTF processing in vivo. The betaCTF level was found to increase in neurons, which was most likely caused by the induction of OA and BACE1 overexpression. Furthermore, these results provide the first evidence that betaCTF can predominately accumulate in the axons of neurons in a hyperphosphorylated tau state in vivo, and suggested that the redistribution of betaCTF is involved in the pathogenesis of AD. These results indicate that BACE1 could be a therapeutic target of AD by affecting the processing of betaCTF.

25159409|t|Alkoxy bridged binuclear rhenium (I) complexes as a potential sensor for beta-amyloid aggregation.
25159409|a|Alkoxy bridged binuclear rhenium(I) complexes are used as a probe for the selective and sensitive detection of aggregation of beta-amyloid fibrils that are consorted with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The strong binding of the complexes is affirmed by the fluorescence enhancement and calculated binding constant value in the order of 10(5)M(-1) is obtained from the Scatchard plots. The binding of beta-amyloid can be attributed to pi-pi stacking interaction of naphthalene moiety present in rhenium(I) complexes, and it is supported by docking studies. The selectivity is quite high towards other proteins and the formation of fibrils can be observed in the range of 30-40 nm through the AFM and TEM techniques.

25160043|t|Reduced cerebrovascular reactivity in young adults carrying the APOE epsilon4 allele.
25160043|a|BACKGROUND: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have shown that APOE epsilon2- and epsilon4-carriers have similar patterns of blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) activation suggesting that we need to look beyond the BOLD signal to link APOE's effect on the brain to Alzheimer's disease (AD)-risk. METHODS: We evaluated APOE-related differences in BOLD activation in response to a memory task, cerebrovascular reactivity using a CO2-inhalation challenge (CO2-CVR), and the potential contribution of CO2-CVR to the BOLD signal. RESULTS: APOE epsilon4-carriers had the highest task-related hippocampal BOLD signal relative to non-carriers. The largest differences in CO2-CVR were between epsilon2- and epsilon4-carriers, with the latter having the lowest values. Genotype differences in CO2-CVR accounted for ~70% of hippocampal BOLD differences between groups. CONCLUSION: Because CO2-CVR gauges vascular health, the differential effect of APOE in young adults may reflect a vascular contribution to the vulnerability of epsilon4-carriers to late-life pathology. Studies confirming our findings are warranted.

25160744|t|Beta-asarone attenuates amyloid beta-induced autophagy via Akt/mTOR pathway in PC12 cells.
25160744|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age related and progressive neurodegenerative disease. Autophagy is a self-degradative process and plays a critical role in removing long-lived proteins and damaged organelles. Recent evidence suggests that autophagy might be involved in the pathogenesis of AD. beta-asarone have various neuroprotective effects. However, the effect of beta-asarone on autophagy in amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) induced cell injury is unclear, and little is known about the signaling pathway of beta-asarone in autophagy regulation. The aim of the present study was to determine whether beta-asarone protects cells from Abeta1-42 induced cytotoxicity via regulation of Beclin-1 dependent autophagy and its regulating signaling pathway. We examined effects of beta-asarone on cell morphology, cell viability, neuron specific enolase (NSE) levels, autophagosomes and regulating Beclin-1, p-Akt and p-mTOR expressions in Abeta1-42 treated PC12 cells. We found that beta-asarone could maintain the original morphology of cells and increase cell viability and decrease NSE levels significantly. Meanwhile, beta-asarone decreased Beclin-1 expression significantly. In addition, beta-asarone can increase levels of p-Akt and p-mTOR. These results showed that beta-asarone protected cells from Abeta1-42 induced cytotoxicity and attenuated autophagy via activation of Akt-mTOR signaling pathway, which could be involved in neuroprotection of beta-asarone against Abeta toxicity. Our findings suggest that beta-asarone might be a potential preventive drug for AD.

25161248|t|Transcriptome-guided amyloid imaging genetic analysis via a novel structured sparse learning algorithm.
25161248|a|MOTIVATION: Imaging genetics is an emerging field that studies the influence of genetic variation on brain structure and function. The major task is to examine the association between genetic markers such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and quantitative traits (QTs) extracted from neuroimaging data. The complexity of these datasets has presented critical bioinformatics challenges that require new enabling tools. Sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA) is a bi-multivariate technique used in imaging genetics to identify complex multi-SNP-multi-QT associations. However, most of the existing SCCA algorithms are designed using the soft thresholding method, which assumes that the input features are independent from one another. This assumption clearly does not hold for the imaging genetic data. In this article, we propose a new knowledge-guided SCCA algorithm (KG-SCCA) to overcome this limitation as well as improve learning results by incorporating valuable prior knowledge. RESULTS: The proposed KG-SCCA method is able to model two types of prior knowledge: one as a group structure (e.g. linkage disequilibrium blocks among SNPs) and the other as a network structure (e.g. gene co-expression network among brain regions). The new model incorporates these prior structures by introducing new regularization terms to encourage weight similarity between grouped or connected features. A new algorithm is designed to solve the KG-SCCA model without imposing the independence constraint on the input features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm with both synthetic and real data. For real data, using an Alzheimer's disease (AD) cohort, we examine the imaging genetic associations between all SNPs in the APOE gene (i.e. top AD gene) and amyloid deposition measures among cortical regions (i.e. a major AD hallmark). In comparison with a widely used SCCA implementation, our KG-SCCA algorithm produces not only improved cross-validation performances but also biologically meaningful results.

25162367|t|Apolipoprotein E genotype and the diagnostic accuracy of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for Alzheimer disease.
25162367|a|IMPORTANCE: Several studies suggest that the apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele modulates cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of beta-amyloid 42 (Abeta42). Whether this effect is secondary to the association of the APOE epsilon4 allele with cortical Abeta deposition or whether APOE epsilon4 directly influences CSF levels of Abeta42 independently of Abeta pathology remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the APOE genotype affects the diagnostic accuracy of CSF biomarkers for Alzheimer disease (AD), in particular Abeta42 levels, and whether the association of APOE epsilon4 with CSF biomarkers depends on cortical Abeta status. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We collected data from 4 different centers in Sweden, Finland, and Germany. Cohort A consisted of 1345 individuals aged 23 to 99 years with baseline CSF samples, including 309 with AD, 287 with prodromal AD, 399 with stable mild cognitive impairment, 99 with dementias other than AD, and 251 controls. Cohort B included 105 nondemented younger individuals (aged 20-34 years) with CSF samples available. Cohort C included 118 patients aged 60 to 80 years with mild cognitive symptoms who underwent flutemetamol F 18 ([18F]flumetamol) positron emission tomography amyloid imaging and CSF tap. EXPOSURES: Standard care. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cerebrospinal fluid levels of Abeta42 and total and phosphorylated tau in relation to the APOE epsilon2/epsilon3/epsilon4 polymorphism in different diagnostic groups and in cases with or without cortical uptake of [18F]flutemetamol. RESULTS: The CSF levels of Abeta42 but not total and phosphorylated tau were lower in APOE epsilon4 carriers compared with noncarriers irrespective of diagnostic group (cohort A). Despite this, CSF levels of Abeta42 differed between participants with AD when compared with controls and those with stable mild cognitive impairment, even when stratifying for APOE genotype (P < .001 to P = .006). Multiple binary logistic regression revealed that CSF levels of Abeta42 and APOE epsilon4 genotype were independent predictors of AD diagnosis. In cohort B, APOE epsilon4 carrier status did not influence CSF levels of Abeta42. Moreover, when stratifying for cortical uptake of [18F]flutemetamol in cohort C, APOE epsilon4 genotype did not influence CSF levels of Abeta42. This result was replicated in a cohort with individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) using carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B scanning. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Cerebrospinal fluid levels of Abeta42 are strongly associated with the diagnosis of AD and cortical Abeta accumulation independent of APOE genotype. The clinical cutoff for CSF levels of Abeta42 should be the same for all APOE genotypes.

25164658|t|Combined treatment with a BACE inhibitor and anti-Abeta antibody gantenerumab enhances amyloid reduction in APPLondon mice.
25164658|a|Therapeutic approaches for prevention or reduction of amyloidosis are currently a main objective in basic and clinical research on Alzheimer's disease. Among the agents explored in clinical trials are anti-Abeta peptide antibodies and secretase inhibitors. Most anti-Abeta antibodies are considered to act via inhibition of amyloidosis and enhanced clearance of existing amyloid, although secretase inhibitors reduce the de novo production of Abeta. Limited information is currently available on the efficacy and potential advantages of combinatorial antiamyloid treatment. We performed a chronic study in APPLondon transgenic mice that received treatment with anti-Abeta antibody gantenerumab and BACE inhibitor RO5508887, either as mono- or combination treatment. Treatment aimed to evaluate efficacy on amyloid progression, similar to preexisting amyloidosis as present in Alzheimer's disease patients. Mono-treatments with either compound caused a dose-dependent reduction of total brain Abeta and amyloid burden. Combination treatment with both compounds significantly enhanced the antiamyloid effect. The observed combination effect was most pronounced for lowering of amyloid plaque load and plaque number, which suggests effective inhibition of de novo plaque formation. Moreover, significantly enhanced clearance of pre-existing amyloid plaques was observed when gantenerumab was coadministered with RO5508887. BACE inhibition led to a significant time- and dose-dependent decrease in CSF Abeta, which was not observed for gantenerumab treatment. Our results demonstrate that combining these two antiamyloid agents enhances overall efficacy and suggests that combination treatments may be of clinical relevance.

25165140|t|Quantitative analysis of APP axonal transport in neurons: role of JIP1 in enhanced APP anterograde transport.
25165140|a|Alzheimer's beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) associates with kinesin-1 via JNK-interacting protein 1 (JIP1); however, the role of JIP1 in APP transport by kinesin-1 in neurons remains unclear. We performed a quantitative analysis to understand the role of JIP1 in APP axonal transport. In JIP1-deficient neurons, we find that both the fast velocity (~2.7 mum/s) and high frequency (66%) of anterograde transport of APP cargo are impaired to a reduced velocity (~1.83 mum/s) and a lower frequency (45%). We identified two novel elements linked to JIP1 function, located in the central region of JIP1b, that interact with the coiled-coil domain of kinesin light chain 1 (KLC1), in addition to the conventional interaction of the JIP1b 11-amino acid C-terminal (C11) region with the tetratricopeptide repeat of KLC1. High frequency of APP anterograde transport is dependent on one of the novel elements in JIP1b. Fast velocity of APP cargo transport requires the C11 domain, which is regulated by the second novel region of JIP1b. Furthermore, efficient APP axonal transport is not influenced by phosphorylation of APP at Thr-668, a site known to be phosphorylated by JNK. Our quantitative analysis indicates that enhanced fast-velocity and efficient high-frequency APP anterograde transport observed in neurons are mediated by novel roles of JIP1b.

25168326|t|Diagnosis and management of neuropathic pain: review of literature and recommendations of the Polish Association for the study of pain and the Polish Neurological Society - part one.
25168326|a|Neuropathic pain still present a major diagnostic and therapeutic challenge despite considerable progress in understanding of its mechanisms and publication of number of studies which assessed the efficacy and safety of drugs used in the symptomatic treatment. In practice, it is diagnosed less frequently than recognised in the epidemiological studies, and many patients do not achieve satisfactory outcomes of treatment. A multidisciplinary team of Polish experts, commissioned by the Polish Association for the Study of Pain and the Polish Neurological Society, has reviewed the literature on neuropathic pain, with special focus on the published international recommendations, and formulated recommendations on neuropathic pain diagnosis and treatment, in accordance with the principles of evidence-based medicine. The paper presents also background information on the neuropathic pain definition, epidemiology, pathomechanism and method of assessment. The diagnosis of neuropathic pain may be established based on medical history and physical examination including special assessment of the somatosensory system. First-line drugs used in pharmacological management of neuropathic pain are: tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, gabapentin, pregabalin, opioids and lidocaine patches.

25168388|t|Identification and characterization of novel associations in the CASP8/ALS2CR12 region on chromosome 2 with breast cancer risk.
25168388|a|Previous studies have suggested that polymorphisms in CASP8 on chromosome 2 are associated with breast cancer risk. To clarify the role of CASP8 in breast cancer susceptibility, we carried out dense genotyping of this region in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning a 1 Mb region around CASP8 were genotyped in 46 450 breast cancer cases and 42 600 controls of European origin from 41 studies participating in the BCAC as part of a custom genotyping array experiment (iCOGS). Missing genotypes and SNPs were imputed and, after quality exclusions, 501 typed and 1232 imputed SNPs were included in logistic regression models adjusting for study and ancestry principal components. The SNPs retained in the final model were investigated further in data from nine genome-wide association studies (GWAS) comprising in total 10 052 case and 12 575 control subjects. The most significant association signal observed in European subjects was for the imputed intronic SNP rs1830298 in ALS2CR12 (telomeric to CASP8), with per allele odds ratio and 95% confidence interval [OR (95% confidence interval, CI)] for the minor allele of 1.05 (1.03-1.07), P = 1 x 10(-5). Three additional independent signals from intronic SNPs were identified, in CASP8 (rs36043647), ALS2CR11 (rs59278883) and CFLAR (rs7558475). The association with rs1830298 was replicated in the imputed results from the combined GWAS (P = 3 x 10(-6)), yielding a combined OR (95% CI) of 1.06 (1.04-1.08), P = 1 x 10(-9). Analyses of gene expression associations in peripheral blood and normal breast tissue indicate that CASP8 might be the target gene, suggesting a mechanism involving apoptosis.

25168729|t|Abeta promotes VDAC1 channel dephosphorylation in neuronal lipid rafts. Relevance to the mechanisms of neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease.
25168729|a|Voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) is a mitochondrial protein abundantly found in neuronal lipid rafts. In these membrane domains, VDAC is associated with a complex of signaling proteins that trigger neuroprotective responses. Loss of lipid raft integrity may result in disruption of multicomplex association and alteration of signaling responses that may ultimately promote VDAC activation. Some data have demonstrated that VDAC at the neuronal membrane may be involved in the mechanisms of amyloid beta (Abeta)-induced neurotoxicity, through yet unknown mechanisms. Abeta is generated from amyloid precursor protein (APP), and is released to the extracellular space where it may undergo self-aggregation. Abeta aggregate deposition in the form of senile plaques may lead to Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology, although other pathological hallmarks (such as hyper-phosphorylated Tau deposition) also participate in this neurodegenerative process. The present study demonstrates that VDAC1 associates with APP and Abeta in lipid rafts of neurons. Interaction of VDAC1 with APP was observed in lipid rafts from the frontal and entorhinal cortex of human brains affected by AD at early stages (I-IV/0-B of Braak and Braak). Furthermore, Abeta exposure enhanced the dephosphorylation of VDAC1 that correlated with cell death. Both effects were reverted in the presence of tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors. VDAC1 dephosphorylation was corroborated in lipid rafts of AD brains. These results demonstrate that Abeta is involved in alterations of the phosphorylation state of VDAC in neuronal lipid rafts. Modulation of this channel may contribute to the development and progression of AD pathology.

25169677|t|Activated human microglia stimulate neuroblastoma cells to upregulate production of beta amyloid protein and tau: implications for Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.
25169677|a|Neuroinflammation is hypothesized to be a major driving force behind Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. This hypothesis predicts that activated microglial cells can stimulate neurons to produce excessive amounts of beta-amyloid protein (Abeta1-42) and tau. The excess Abeta1-42 forms extracellular deposits which stimulate further microglial activation. The excess tau is partially released but also becomes phosphorylated forming intracellular neurofibrillary deposits. The end result is a positive feedback mechanism which drives the disease development. To test the viability of this hypothesis, we exposed differentiated SH-SY5Y and N-tera2/D1 (N-tera2) cells to conditioned medium (CM) from LPS/IFNgamma-stimulated human microglia. We found that the CM caused a large increase in the production and release of Abeta and tau. The CM also caused SH-SY5Y cells to increase their expression of amyloid precursor protein and release of its beta-secretase cleaved products (sAPPbetas) as well as Abeta oligomers, but the CM reduced release of its alpha-secretase cleaved products (sAPPalphas). Direct treatment of SH-SY5Y and N-tera2 cells with the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1beta as well as with Abeta1-42, resulted in an increase in tau messenger RNA and protein expression. Pretreatment of LPS/IFNgamma-stimulated human microglia cells with the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ibuprofen and aspirin, the antioxidant GSH, the H2S donor NaSH, and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, resulted in a CM with diminished ability to stimulate tau expression. There was no effect on the morphology of SH-SY5Y cells, or on their viability, following exposure to micromolar levels of Abeta1-42. Our data indicate that reactive microglia play an important role in governing the expression of Abeta and tau, and therefore the progression of AD. They provide further evidence that appropriate anti-inflammatory treatment should be beneficial in AD.

25170035|t|Standardised clients as assessors in a veterinary communication OSCE: a reliability and validity study.
25170035|a|In human medicine, standardised patients (SP) have been shown to reliably and accurately assess learners' communication performance in high-stakes certification Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCE), offering a feasible way to reduce the need for recruitment, time commitment and coordination of faculty assessors. In this study, we evaluated the use of standardised clients (SC) as a viable option for assessing veterinary students' communication performance. We designed a four-station, two-track communication skills OSCE. SC assessors used an adapted nine-item Liverpool Undergraduate Communication Assessment Scale (LUCAS). Faculty used a 21-item checklist derived from the Calgary-Cambridge Guide (CCG) and a five-point global rating scale. Participants were second year veterinary students (n=96). For the four stations, intrastation reliability (alpha) ranged from 0.63 to 0.82 for the LUCAS, and 0.73 to 0.87 for the CCG. The interstation reliability coefficients were 0.85 for the LUCAS and 0.89 for the CGG. The calculated Generalisability (G) coefficients were 0.62 for the LUCAS and 0.60 for the CGG. Supporting construct validity, SC and faculty assessors showed a significant correlation between the LUCAS and CCG total percent scores (r=0.45, P<0.001), and likewise between the LUCAS and global rating scores (r=0.49, P<0.001).Study results support that SC assessors offer a reliable and valid approach for assessing veterinary communication OSCE.

25171414|t|Axonally synthesized ATF4 transmits a neurodegenerative signal across brain regions.
25171414|a|In Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, exposure of axons to Abeta causes pathogenic changes that spread retrogradely by unknown mechanisms, affecting the entire neuron. We found that locally applied Abeta1-42 initiates axonal synthesis of a defined set of proteins including the transcription factor ATF4. Inhibition of local translation and retrograde transport or knockdown of axonal Atf4 mRNA abolished Abeta-induced ATF4 transcriptional activity and cell loss. Abeta1-42 injection into the dentate gyrus (DG) of mice caused loss of forebrain neurons whose axons project to the DG. Protein synthesis and Atf4 mRNA were upregulated in these axons, and coinjection of Atf4 siRNA into the DG reduced the effects of Abeta1-42 in the forebrain. ATF4 protein and transcripts were found with greater frequency in axons in the brain of AD patients. These results reveal an active role for intra-axonal translation in neurodegeneration and identify ATF4 as a mediator for the spread of AD pathology.

25171862|t|A commonly used Drosophila model of Alzheimer's disease generates an aberrant species of amyloid-beta with an additional N-terminal glutamine residue.
25171862|a|Expression of human amyloid-beta (Abeta) in Drosophila is frequently used to investigate its toxicity in vivo. We expressed Abeta1-42 in the fly using a secretion signal derived from the Drosophila necrotic gene, as described in several previous publications. Surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization TOF MS analysis revealed that the Abeta produced contained an additional glutamine residue at the N-terminus. AbetaQ+1-42 was found to have increased protein abundance and to cause more severe neurodegenerative effects than wild type Abeta1-42 as assessed by locomotor activity and lifespan assays. These data reveal that a commonly used model of Alzheimer's disease generates incorrect Abeta peptide.

25172417|t|'Click' assembly of glycoclusters and discovery of a trehalose analogue that retards Abeta40 aggregation and inhibits Abeta40-induced neurotoxicity.
25172417|a|Osmolytes have been proposed as treatments for neurodegenerative proteinopathies including Alzheimer's disease. However, for osmolytes to reach the clinic their efficacy must be improved. In this work, copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition chemistry was used to synthesize glycoclusters bearing six copies of trehalose, lactose, galactose or glucose, with the aim of improving the potency of these osmolytes via multivalency. A trehalose glycocluster was found to be superior to monomeric trehalose in its ability to retard the formation of amyloid-beta peptide 40 (Abeta40) fibrils and protect neurons from Abeta40-induced cell death.

25173404|t|Puerarin protects against beta-amyloid-induced microglia apoptosis via a PI3K-dependent signaling pathway.
25173404|a|Puerarin extracted from Radix puerariae is well-known for its anti-oxidative and neuroprotective activities. In this study, we investigated the protective effect of puerarin on amyloid-beta protein (Abeta)-induced cytotoxicity and its potential mechanisms in BV-2 and primary microglial cells. We found that pretreatment with puerarin afforded protection against Abeta-induced cytotoxicity through inhibiting apoptosis in BV-2 and primary microglial cells. This result was also confirmed by the activated caspase-3 assay. Phospho-Akt and Bcl-2 expression increased after pretreatment with puerarin in BV-2 and primary microglial cells exposed to Abeta, whereas Bax expression and cytochrome c release decreased. In addition, puerarin treatment prevented the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species production. Interestingly, these effects of puerarin against Abeta insult were abolished by LY294002, an inhibitor of PI3K phosphorylation. Taken together, these findings suggest that puerarin prevents Abeta-induced microglial apoptosis via the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, and might be a potential preventive or therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease.

25173807|t|Novel therapeutic strategy for neurodegeneration by blocking Abeta seeding mediated aggregation in models of Alzheimer's disease.
25173807|a|Abeta accumulation plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies suggest that the process of Abeta nucleated polymerization is essential for Abeta fibril formation, pathology spreading and toxicity. Therefore, targeting this process represents an effective therapeutic strategy to slow or block disease progression. To discover compounds that might interfere with the Abeta seeding capacity, toxicity and pathology spreading, we screened a focused library of FDA-approved drugs in vitro using a seeding polymerization assay and identified small molecule inhibitors that specifically interfered with Abeta seeding-mediated fibril growth and toxicity. Mitoxantrone, bithionol and hexachlorophene were found to be the strongest inhibitors of fibril growth and protected primary cortical neuronal cultures against Abeta-induced toxicity. Next, we assessed the effects of these three inhibitors in vivo in the mThy1-APPtg mouse model of AD (8-month-old mice). We found that mitoxantrone and bithionol, but not hexachlorophene, stabilized diffuse amyloid plaques, reduced the levels of Abeta42 oligomers and ameliorated synapse loss, neuronal damage and astrogliosis. Together, our findings suggest that targeting fibril growth and Abeta seeding capacity constitutes a viable and effective strategy for protecting against neurodegeneration and disease progression in AD.

25176146|t|Amyloid-beta peptide induces mitochondrial dysfunction by inhibition of preprotein maturation.
25176146|a|Most mitochondrial proteins possess N-terminal presequences that are required for targeting and import into the organelle. Upon import, presequences are cleaved off by matrix processing peptidases and subsequently degraded by the peptidasome Cym1/PreP, which also degrades Amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta). Here we find that impaired turnover of presequence peptides results in feedback inhibition of presequence processing enzymes. Moreover, Abeta inhibits degradation of presequence peptides by PreP, resulting in accumulation of mitochondrial preproteins and processing intermediates. Dysfunctional preprotein maturation leads to rapid protein degradation and an imbalanced organellar proteome. Our findings reveal a general mechanism by which Abeta peptide can induce the multiple diverse mitochondrial dysfunctions accompanying Alzheimer's disease.

25178175|t|Japanese Guideline for Adult Asthma 2014.
25178175|a|Adult bronchial asthma (hereinafter, asthma) is characterized by chronic airway inflammation, reversible airway narrowing, and airway hyperresponsiveness. Long-standing asthma induces airway remodeling to cause intractable asthma. The number of patients with asthma has increased, and that of patients who die from asthma has decreased (1.5 per 100,000 patients in 2012). The aim of asthma treatment is to enable patients with asthma to lead a normal life without any symptoms. A good relationship between physicians and patients is indispensable for appropriate treatment. Long-term management with antiasthmatic agents and elimination of the causes and risk factors of asthma are fundamental to its treatment. Four steps in pharmacotherapy differentiate between mild and intensive treatments; each step includes an appropriate daily dose of an inhaled corticosteroid, varying from low to high. Long-acting beta2-agonists, leukotriene receptor antagonists, and sustained-release theophylline are recommended as concomitant drugs, while anti-immunoglobulin E antibody therapy has been recently developed for the most severe and persistent asthma involving allergic reactions. Inhaled beta2-agonists, aminophylline, corticosteroids, adrenaline, oxygen therapy, and others are used as needed in acute exacerbations by choosing treatment steps for asthma exacerbations depending on the severity of attacks. Allergic rhinitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, aspirin-induced asthma, pregnancy, asthma in athletes, and cough-variant asthma are also important issues that need to be considered.

25178521|t|Health economics and outcomes research fellowship practices reviewed.
25178521|a|The guidelines for health economics and outcomes research (HEOR) fellowship training programs devised by the American College of Clinical Pharmacy (ACCP) and the International Society of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) suggest that continuous improvements are made to ensure that postgraduate training through didactic and professional experiences prepare fellows for HEOR research careers. The HEOR Fellowship Program at Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation was standardized to enhance the fellows' HEOR research understanding and align professional skill sets with the ACCP-ISPOR Fellowship Program Guidelines. Based on feedback from an internal task force comprised of HEOR employees and current and former fellows, the HEOR Fellowship Program was normatively and qualitatively assessed to evaluate the current curricular program. Fellowship program activities were instituted to ensure that the suggested minimum level requirements established by the guidelines were being met. Research opportunities enabling fellows to work hand-in-hand with other fellows and HEOR professionals were emphasized. Curricular enhancements in research methodology and professional training and development, and materials for a structured journal club focusing on specific methodological and HEOR research topics were developed. A seminar series (e.g., creating SMART Goals, StrengthsFinder 2.0) and professional courses (e.g., ISPOR short courses, statistics.com) were included to enhance the fellows' short- and long-term professional experience. Additional program attributes include an online reference library developed to enrich the current research facilities and a Statistical Analysis Software training program. Continuously assessing and updating HEOR fellowship programs keeps programs up-to-date in the latest HEOR concepts and approaches used to evaluate health care, both professionally and educationally. 

25178721|t|Sulforaphane interaction with amyloid beta 1-40 peptide studied by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.
25178721|a|RATIONALE: Aggregation of amyloid beta 1-40 (Abeta) in the brain causes Alzheimer's disease (AD) and several small molecules are known to inhibit the aggregation process. Sulforaphane (SFN) is a natural isothiocyanate which is known to prevent various neurodegenerative processes. However, its interaction with Abeta is yet to be explored. Such studies could provide new mechanistic insights for its neuroprotective properties. METHODS: Liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS) and in-source fragmentation experiments were performed on an Orbitrap mass spectrometer. The solution of Abeta and SFN was incubated and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Isotopic distribution patterns, accurate mass values and theoretical product ions were used to analyze the mass spectrometry data. The nature of binding of SFN and its binding sites with Abeta were evaluated by LC/MS and trypsin digestion experiments. RESULTS: ESI-MS analysis of the incubated solution of Abeta and SFN showed a 1:1 complex of [Abeta+SFN]. LC/MS analysis revealed that the solution contains three different [Abeta+SFN] complexes due to covalent binding of SFN to Abeta at three different sites. The in-source fragmentation experiments revealed that SFN is binding to free NH(2) groups (N-terminal amino acid and lysines) in Abeta. Trypsin digestion experiments further confirmed the SFN binding sites in Abeta. CONCLUSIONS: The interaction of SFN, an anticancer agent, with Abeta was studied using ESI-MS. SFN is found to bind covalently and specifically with the free NH(2) group of N-terminal aspartic acid and the epsilon-amino group of lysine at positions 16 and 28. Aggregation assay studies showed a lesser inclination of Abeta to aggregate when SFN is present. Hence the present study helps in understanding the mechanism of the action of SFN on the Abeta peptide.

25179227|t|Curcumin derivative with the substitution at C-4 position, but not curcumin, is effective against amyloid pathology in APP/PS1 mice.
25179227|a|Recent evidence supports the amyloid cascade hypothesis that a pathological change of amyloid beta (Abeta) in the brain is an initiating event in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Accordingly, modulating the abnormal Abeta aggregation is considered a potential therapeutic target in AD. Curcumin, a low-molecular-weight polyphenol derived from the well-known curry spice turmeric, has shown favorable effects on preventing or treating AD pathology. The present study investigated the effects of curcumin and 2 novel curcumin derivatives, FMeC1 and FMeC2, on AD pathology in APPswe/PS1dE9 double transgenic mice. Mice fed a chow diet that contained FMeC1 for 6 months showed a reduction in insoluble Abeta deposits and glial cell activity together with reduced cognitive deficits, compared to animals receiving a control diet or with curcumin or FMeC2 in their diet. Both curcumin and FMeC1 modulated the formation of Abeta aggregates; however, only FMeC1 significantly attenuated the cell toxicity of Abeta. These results indicate that FMeC1 may have potential for preventing AD.

25179438|t|Effects of oxidation on redox and cytotoxic properties of copper complex of Abeta1-16 peptide.
25179438|a|The effect of oxidation on redox and cytotoxic properties of copper complex of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide was studied by gamma radiolysis. The oxidation of Abeta1-16 and Abeta1-16/Cu(II) complex was carried out using hydroxyl (( )OH) radicals produced by gamma radiolysis and the products were analyzed using mass spectrometry. The presence of Cu(II) was found to enhance the oxidation of Abeta1-16 peptide. The oxidation of residues Asp1, His6, and His13 was enhanced due to their involvement in copper binding. The oxidation of His residues of Abeta1-16 peptide, which are chiefly responsible for copper binding, resulted in altered redox properties and subsequently in higher cytotoxicity of the Abeta1-16 peptide in SH-SY5Y cells.

25179671|t|Moving beyond anti-amyloid therapy for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
25179671|a|BACKGROUND: High-profile Phase 3 clinical trials of bapineuzumab and solanezumab, antibodies targeted at amyloid-beta (Abeta) removal, have failed to meet their primary endpoints. Neither drug improves clinical outcomes in patients with late onset AD, joining a long list of unsuccessful attempts to treat AD with anti-amyloid therapies. DISCUSSION: These therapies are based on the assumption that Abeta accumulation is the primary pathogenic trigger of AD. Current evidence suggests that Abeta may actually accumulate as part of an adaptive response to long-term chronic brain stress stimuli that would make more suitable candidates for therapeutic intervention. SUMMARY: At this juncture it is no longer unreasonable to suggest that further iterations of anti-Abeta therapies should be halted. Clinicians and researchers should instead direct their attention toward greater understanding of the biological function of Abeta both in healthy and demented brains, as well as the involvement of long-term chronic exposure to stress in the etiology of AD.

25180020|t|The adipocyte differentiation protein APMAP is an endogenous suppressor of Abeta production in the brain.
25180020|a|The deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregates in the brain is a major pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta is generated from the cleavage of C-terminal fragments of the amyloid precursor protein (APP-CTFs) by gamma-secretase, an intramembrane-cleaving protease with multiple substrates, including the Notch receptors. Endogenous modulation of gamma-secretase is pointed to be implicated in the sporadic, age-dependent form of AD. Moreover, specifically modulating Abeta production has become a priority for the safe treatment of AD because the inhibition of gamma-secretase results in adverse effects that are related to impaired Notch cleavage. Here, we report the identification of the adipocyte differentiation protein APMAP as a novel endogenous suppressor of Abeta generation. We found that APMAP interacts physically with gamma-secretase and its substrate APP. In cells, the partial depletion of APMAP drastically increased the levels of APP-CTFs, as well as uniquely affecting their stability, with the consequence being increased secretion of Abeta. In wild-type and APP/ presenilin 1 transgenic mice, partial adeno-associated virus-mediated APMAP knockdown in the hippocampus increased Abeta production by ~20 and ~55%, respectively. Together, our data demonstrate that APMAP is a negative regulator of Abeta production through its interaction with APP and gamma-secretase. All observed APMAP phenotypes can be explained by an impaired degradation of APP-CTFs, likely caused by an altered substrate transport capacity to the lysosomal/autophagic system.

25180241|t|Independent emergence of artemisinin resistance mutations among Plasmodium falciparum in Southeast Asia.
25180241|a|BACKGROUND: The emergence of artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum in Southeast Asia threatens malaria treatment efficacy. Mutations in a kelch protein encoded on P. falciparum chromosome 13 (K13) have been associated with resistance in vitro and in field samples from Cambodia. METHODS: P. falciparum infections from artesunate efficacy trials in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam were genotyped at 33 716 genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Linear mixed models were used to test associations between parasite genotypes and parasite clearance half-lives following artesunate treatment. K13 mutations were tested for association with artemisinin resistance, and extended haplotypes on chromosome 13 were examined to determine whether mutations arose focally and spread or whether they emerged independently. RESULTS: The presence of nonreference K13 alleles was associated with prolonged parasite clearance half-life (P = 1.97 x 10(-12)). Parasites with a mutation in any of the K13 kelch domains displayed longer parasite clearance half-lives than parasites with wild-type alleles. Haplotype analysis revealed both population-specific emergence of mutations and independent emergence of the same mutation in different geographic areas. CONCLUSIONS: K13 appears to be a major determinant of artemisinin resistance throughout Southeast Asia. While we found some evidence of spreading resistance, there was no evidence of resistance moving westward from Cambodia into Myanmar.

25186765|t|Inhibition of AMP-activated protein kinase signaling alleviates impairments in hippocampal synaptic plasticity induced by amyloid beta.
25186765|a|The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a Ser/Thr kinase that is activated in response to low-energy states to coordinate multiple signaling pathways to maintain cellular energy homeostasis. Dysregulation of AMPK signaling has been observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is associated with abnormal neuronal energy metabolism. In the current study we tested the hypothesis that aberrant AMPK signaling underlies AD-associated synaptic plasticity impairments by using pharmacological and genetic approaches. We found that amyloid beta (Abeta)-induced inhibition of long-term potentiation (LTP) and enhancement of long-term depression were corrected by the AMPK inhibitor compound C (CC). Similarly, LTP impairments in APP/PS1 transgenic mice that model AD were improved by CC treatment. In addition, Abeta-induced LTP failure was prevented in mice with genetic deletion of the AMPK alpha2-subunit, the predominant AMPK catalytic subunit in the brain. Furthermore, we found that eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) and its kinase eEF2K are key downstream effectors that mediate the detrimental effects of hyperactive AMPK in AD pathophysiology. Our findings describe a previously unrecognized role of aberrant AMPK signaling in AD-related synaptic pathophysiology and reveal a potential therapeutic target for AD.

25186863|t|Influence of BDNF Val66Met on the relationship between physical activity and brain volume.
25186863|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between habitual physical activity levels and brain temporal lobe volumes, and the interaction with the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met polymorphism. METHODS: This study is a cross-sectional analysis of 114 cognitively healthy men and women aged 60 years and older. Brain volumes quantified by MRI were correlated with self-reported physical activity levels. The effect of the interaction between physical activity and the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism on brain structure volumes was assessed. Post hoc analyses were completed to evaluate the influence of the APOE epsilon4 allele on any found associations. RESULTS: The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism interacted with physical activity to be associated with hippocampal (beta = -0.22, p = 0.02) and temporal lobe (beta = -0.28, p = 0.003) volumes. In Val/Val homozygotes, higher levels of physical activity were associated with larger hippocampal and temporal lobe volumes, whereas in Met carriers, higher levels of physical activity were associated with smaller temporal lobe volume. CONCLUSION: The findings from this study support higher physical activity levels in the potential attenuation of age- and disease-related hippocampal and temporal lobe volume loss in Val/Val homozygotes.

25187042|t|Age-Dependent Effect of beta-Amyloid Toxicity on Basal Forebrain Cholinergic Neurons and Inflammation in the Rat Brain.
25187042|a|Beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation, neuroinflammation, basal forebrain cholinergic loss and hippocampal degeneration are well-described pathologies associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the role that age plays in the susceptibility of the brain to these AD pathologies and the relationships between them is still not well understood. This study investigated the age-related response to intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta(25-35) in 3-, 6- and 9-month-old rats. Abeta toxicity resulted in an age-related increase in cholinergic loss and microglial activation in the basal forebrain along with neuronal loss in the hippocampal CA3 subfield. Performance in the Morris water maze revealed impairments in long-term reference memory in 6-month-old Abeta administered animals, which was not seen in 3-month-old animals. These results support a role of Abeta administration in inducing age-dependent cholinergic loss and neuroinflammation, and additionally provide evidence for a more age-appropriate model of adult-onset Abeta toxicity demonstrating pathological changes that reflect the early stages of AD pathogenesis including neuroinflammation, cholinergic loss and beginning stages of memory impairment.

25188341|t|Genome-wide association meta-analysis of neuropathologic features of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.
25188341|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias are a major public health challenge and present a therapeutic imperative for which we need additional insight into molecular pathogenesis. We performed a genome-wide association study and analysis of known genetic risk loci for AD dementia using neuropathologic data from 4,914 brain autopsies. Neuropathologic data were used to define clinico-pathologic AD dementia or controls, assess core neuropathologic features of AD (neuritic plaques, NPs; neurofibrillary tangles, NFTs), and evaluate commonly co-morbid neuropathologic changes: cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), Lewy body disease (LBD), hippocampal sclerosis of the elderly (HS), and vascular brain injury (VBI). Genome-wide significance was observed for clinico-pathologic AD dementia, NPs, NFTs, CAA, and LBD with a number of variants in and around the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE). GalNAc transferase 7 (GALNT7), ATP-Binding Cassette, Sub-Family G (WHITE), Member 1 (ABCG1), and an intergenic region on chromosome 9 were associated with NP score; and Potassium Large Conductance Calcium-Activated Channel, Subfamily M, Beta Member 2 (KCNMB2) was strongly associated with HS. Twelve of the 21 non-APOE genetic risk loci for clinically-defined AD dementia were confirmed in our clinico-pathologic sample: CR1, BIN1, CLU, MS4A6A, PICALM, ABCA7, CD33, PTK2B, SORL1, MEF2C, ZCWPW1, and CASS4 with 9 of these 12 loci showing larger odds ratio in the clinico-pathologic sample. Correlation of effect sizes for risk of AD dementia with effect size for NFTs or NPs showed positive correlation, while those for risk of VBI showed a moderate negative correlation. The other co-morbid neuropathologic features showed only nominal association with the known AD loci. Our results discovered new genetic associations with specific neuropathologic features and aligned known genetic risk for AD dementia with specific neuropathologic changes in the largest brain autopsy study of AD and related dementias.

25190447|t|Cerebral amyloid angiopathy increases susceptibility to infarction after focal cerebral ischemia in Tg2576 mice.
25190447|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We and others have shown that soluble amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) cause significant cerebrovascular dysfunction in mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) mice, and that these deficits are greater in aged APP mice having CAA compared with young APP mice lacking CAA. Amyloid beta-peptide in young APP mice also increases infarction after focal cerebral ischemia, but the impact of CAA on ischemic brain injury is unknown. METHODS: To determine this, we assessed cerebrovascular reactivity, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and extent of infarction and neurological deficits after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in aged APP mice having extensive CAA versus young APP mice lacking CAA (and aged-matched littermate controls). RESULTS: We found that aged APP mice have more severe cerebrovascular dysfunction that is CAA dependent, have greater CBF compromise during and immediately after middle cerebral artery occlusion, and develop larger infarctions after middle cerebral artery occlusion. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate CAA induces a more severe form of cerebrovascular dysfunction than amyloid beta-peptide alone, leading to intra- and postischemic CBF deficits that ultimately exacerbate cerebral infarction. Our results shed mechanistic light on human studies identifying CAA as an independent risk factor for ischemic brain injury.

25192053|t|Theoretical impact of Florbetapir (18F) amyloid imaging on diagnosis of alzheimer dementia and detection of preclinical cortical amyloid.
25192053|a|In 2012, florbetapir (F) (Amyvid) received US Food and Drug Administration approval as a diagnostic agent for detecting neuritic (beta-amyloid) plaques in living patients. Although such approval is specifically not extended to the use of florbetapir as a single definitive diagnostic test for Alzheimer disease dementia (ADD), it is of considerable importance to examine its potential in this regard. To estimate the ability of florbetapir amyloid imaging to detect specified densities of postmortem-identified neuritic plaques, we used the data of Clark et al [Clark CM, Pontecorvo MJ, Beach TG, et al. Cerebral PET with florbetapir compared with neuropathology at autopsy for detection of neuritic amyloid-beta plaques: A prospective cohort study. Lancet Neurol 2012;11:669-78]. We then used the data of Beach et al [Beach TG, Monsell SE, Phillips LE, et al. Accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer disease at National Institute on Aging Alzheimer Disease Centers, 2005-2010. J Neuropathol Exp Neurol 2012;71:266-73], derived from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, to estimate the fraction of subjects who would have been called florbetapir-positive and, among these, the fraction of subjects who would also meet neuropathologic criteria for the presence of ADD. The accuracy of a positive florbetapir beta-amyloid scan for the detection of neuropathologically defined ADD is estimated at between 69% and 95% sensitivity and between 83% and 89% specificity. From the same National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center data set, 144 subjects were recorded as having normal cognition. Among these, 84 (58%) had at least sparse neuritic plaques at autopsy and, among these, florbetapir imaging was estimated to detect 47 (56%). These findings suggest that amyloid imaging may significantly improve the clinical identification of ADD.

25192386|t|Dimerization process of amyloid-beta(29-42) studied by the Hamiltonian replica-permutation molecular dynamics simulations.
25192386|a|The amyloid-beta peptides form amyloid fibrils which are associated with Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid-beta(29-42) is its C-terminal fragment and a critical determinant of the amyloid formation rate. This fragment forms the amyloid fibril by itself. However, the fragment conformation in the fibril has yet to be determined. The oligomerization process including the dimerization process is also still unknown. The dimerization process corresponds to an early process of the amyloidogenesis. In order to investigate the dimerization process and conformations, we applied the Hamiltonian replica-permutation method, which is a better alternative to the Hamiltonian replica-exchange method, to two amyloid-beta(29-42) molecules in explicit water solvent. At the first step of the dimerization process, two amyloid-beta(29-42) molecules came close to each other and had intermolecular side chain contacts. When two molecules had the intermolecular side chain contacts, the amyloid-beta(29-42) tended to have intramolecular secondary structures, especially beta-hairpin structures. The two molecules had intermolecular beta-bridge structures by coming much closer at the second step of the dimerization process. Formation of these intermolecular beta-bridge structures was induced by the beta-hairpin structures. The intermolecular beta-sheet structures elongated at the final step. Structures of the amyloid-beta(29-42) in the monomer and dimer states are also shown with the free-energy landscapes, which were obtained by performing efficient sampling in the conformational space in our simulations.

25192556|t|Molecular tethering effect of C-terminus of amyloid peptide abeta42.
25192556|a|Amyloid peptides are considered to be the main contributor for the membrane disruption related to the pathogenesis of degenerative diseases. The variation of amino acids at the carboxylic terminus of amyloid peptide has revealed significant effects on the modulation of abnormal assemblies of amyloid peptides. In this work, molecular binding agents were tethered to the C-terminus of beta-amyloid peptide 1-42 (Abeta42). The molecular interaction between Abeta42 and molecule tethers was identified at single molecule level by using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The mechanistic insight into the feature variation of the self-assembly of Abeta42 peptide caused by molecular tethering at C-terminus was clearly revealed, which could appreciably affect the nucleation of amyloid peptide, thus reducing the membrane disruptions.

25192689|t|Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and return to sport activity: postural control as the key to success.
25192689|a|PURPOSE: The risk for re-tear following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is influenced by several hormonal, neuromuscular, biomechanical and anatomic factors. One of the most important negative prognostic factors that markedly increase the risk for ACL re-tear is the presence of high knee-abduction moment (KAM), which can be measured immediately by landing on both feet after a vertical jump. We evaluated the effect in postoperative values for KAM according to the type of graft used for ACL reconstruction (hamstring vs patellar tendon) and a specific rehabilitation protocol focusing on recovery of muscular strength, proprioception and joint stabilisation. METHODS: From November 2010 to September 2012, we enrolled 40 female recreational athletes with clinical and imaging evidence of ACL tear and randomised them in two groups. One group of patients underwent reconstruction with a hamstring-tendon graft and the second with a patellar-tendon graft. A custom rehabilitation programme focusing on proprioception was adopted. Clinical outcomes [International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm scores] and performance in functional test for stability (single-leg hop, timed hop, crossover triple hop, KAM test) were assessed preoperatively at three and six months postoperatively. RESULTS: All patients showed statistically significant clinical improvements postoperatively when compared with preoperative values (P < 0.0001). No significant intergroup difference was observed in all clinical scores and functional tests, with the exception of the value registered for the KAM test (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: ACL reconstruction using patellar-tendon graft followed by rehabilitation centred on strength, proprioception and stability restoration can produce satisfactory values for KAM within the physiological range. The surgical strategies should be adapted to the patient on the basis of a multidisciplinary approach.

25193013|t|Why are prions and amyloid structures immune suppressive and other intriguing questions facing neuroimmunologists in the future.
25193013|a|The immune system plays a major role in certain diseases of the brain like multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica, while the brain may play a major role in modulating certain immunologic diseases of the periphery like inflammatory bowel disease. The most significant developments in neuroimmunology will involve explorations of the roles for the immune system in neurodegenerative conditions often associated with the presence of amyloid deposits. Here I present my personal perspectives on four of the most intriguing challenges that we face in the future of neuroimmunology: (1) Why are the traditional hallmarks of innate and adaptive inflammation conspicuously absent from brains of individuals with prion disease and amyloid pathology? (2) What is the role of adaptive and innate immunity in progressive forms of multiple sclerosis? (3) Is molecular mimicry an adequate explanation for the initiation of neuroinflammatory disease and for exacerbations in conditions like multiple sclerosis, narcolepsy, and neuromyelitis optica? (4) Do neural pathways regulate inflammatory diseases outside the nervous system?

25193102|t|Echinacoside inhibits amyloid fibrillization of HEWL and protects against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity.
25193102|a|Amyloid protein depositions play crucial roles in a variety of degenerative disorders composing amyloidosis. There is a great interest in developing small molecule inhibitors of amyloidogenic processes. We examined the inhibitory effects of echinacoside (ECH) with different concentrations and at different fiber-forming stages in vitro utilizing the hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) model system. We also evaluated the antioxidant capacity of ECH by using elimination tests for the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and hydroxyl (HO) free radicals. We investigated the protection provided by ECH against neurotoxicity induced by beta-amyloid protein (Abeta). Through spectroscopic analyses, electron microscopy, cell viability assay, and hemolysis assay, we found that ECH dose dependently inhibited HEWL aggregation, and this inhibition occurred in different fiber-forming stages. ECH could also scavenge the DPPH and OH free radicals in a concentration-dependent manner. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluoresceindiacetate (DCFH-DA) fluorescent measurement results indicated that ECH could increase viability of rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells injured by Abeta and suppress the increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) triggered by Abeta. The present study findings facilitate a better understanding of the interaction between ECH and amyloid-forming proteins and also shed light on the protection of ECH against amyloid fibril-induced neuronal cell death.

25193238|t|Brilliant Blue G improves cognition in an animal model of Alzheimer's disease and inhibits amyloid-beta-induced loss of filopodia and dendrite spines in hippocampal neurons.
25193238|a|Deposits of amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein are one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Numerous studies report that the Abeta peptide, especially in the oligomeric form, causes memory decline and other cognitive deficits. However, there have been very few effective interventions for termination or even delay of AD progression. Brilliant Blue G (BBG), a safe triphenylmethane dye and P2X7 antagonist, has been reported to have protective effects on neuroinflammation, ischemia, spinal injury and neurodegenerative disorders. Here we report that systematic administration of BBG diminishes spatial memory impairment and cognitive deficits in a mouse AD model produced by injecting soluble Abeta peptide into the hippocampal CA1 region. In addition, we show that Abeta-induced loss of filopodia and spine density in cultured hippocampal neurons was prevented by administration of BBG. We conclude that BBG prevents the learning and memory impairment and cognitive deficits induced by the toxicity of soluble Abeta, and improves the development of dendritic spines in hippocampal neurons in an AD model mouse. Considering the safety and blood-brain-barrier (BBB)-permeability of BBG, our data suggest a potential for BBG as a new therapy for AD.

25193240|t|Abeta seeds resist inactivation by formaldehyde.
25193240|a|Cerebral beta-amyloidosis can be exogenously induced by the intracerebral injection of brain extracts containing aggregated beta-amyloid (Abeta) into young, pre-depositing Abeta precursor protein- (APP) transgenic mice. Previous work has shown that the induction involves a prion-like seeding mechanism in which the seeding agent is aggregated Abeta itself. Here we report that the beta-amyloid-inducing activity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain tissue or aged APP-transgenic mouse brain tissue is preserved, albeit with reduced efficacy, after formaldehyde fixation. Moreover, spectral analysis with amyloid conformation-sensitive luminescent conjugated oligothiophene dyes reveals that the strain-like properties of aggregated Abeta are maintained in fixed tissues. The resistance of Abeta seeds to inactivation and structural modification by formaldehyde underscores their remarkable durability, which in turn may contribute to their persistence and spread within the body. The present findings can be exploited to establish the relationship between the molecular structure of Abeta aggregates and the variable clinical features and disease progression of AD even in archived, formalin-fixed autopsy material.

25193696|t|Key roles of Arg(5), Tyr(10) and his residues in Abeta-heme peroxidase: relevance to Alzheimer's disease.
25193696|a|Recent reports show that heme binds to amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and forms Abeta-heme complexes, thus leading a pathological feature of AD. However, the important biological relevance to AD etiology, resulting from human Abeta-heme peroxidase formation, was not well characterized. In this study, we used wild-type and mutated human Abeta1-16 peptides and investigated their Abeta-heme peroxidase activities. Our results indicated that both histidine residues (His(13), His(14)) in Abeta1-16 and free histidine enhanced the peroxidase activity of heme, hence His residues were essential in peroxidase activity of Abeta-heme complexes. Moreover, Arg(5) was found to be the key residue in making the Abeta1-16-heme complex as a peroxidase. Under oxidative and nitrative stress conditions, the Abeta1-16-heme complexes caused oxidation and nitration of the Abeta Tyr(10) residue through promoting peroxidase-like reactions. Therefore, these residues (Arg(5), Tyr(10) and His) were pivotal in human Abeta-heme peroxidase activity. However, three of these residues (Arg(5), Tyr(10) and His(13)) identified in this study are all absent in rodents, where rodent Abeta-heme complex lacks peroxidase activity and it does not show AD, implicating the novel significance of these residues as well as human Abeta-heme peroxidase in the pathology of AD.

25193991|t|Phase I/IIa study evaluating the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of lucitanib in advanced solid tumors.
25193991|a|BACKGROUND: Lucitanib is a potent, oral inhibitor fibroblast growth factor receptor types 1 and 2 (FGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor types 1, 2, and 3 (VEGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor types alpha and beta (PGFRalpha/beta), which are essential kinases for tumor growth, survival, migration, and angiogenesis. Several tumor types, including breast carcinoma, demonstrate amplification of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-related genes. There are no approved drugs for molecularly defined FGF-aberrant (FGFR1- or FGF3/4/19-amplified) tumors. METHODS: This open-label phase I/IIa study involved a dose-escalation phase to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended dose (RD), and pharmacokinetics of lucitanib in patients with advanced solid tumors, followed by a dose-expansion phase to obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy in patients who could potentially benefit from treatment (i.e. with tumors harboring FGF-aberrant pathway or considered angiogenesis-sensitive). RESULTS: Doses from 5 to 30 mg were evaluated with dose-limiting toxic effects dominated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibition-related toxic effects at the 30 mg dose level (one case of grade 4 depressed level of consciousness and two cases of grade 3 thrombotic microangiopathy). The most common adverse events (all grades, all cohorts) were hypertension (91%), asthenia (42%), and proteinuria (57%). Exposure increased with dose and t1/2 was 31-40 h, suitable for once daily administration. Seventy-six patients were included. All but one had stage IV; 42% had >3 lines of previous chemotherapy. Sixty-four patients were assessable for response; 58 had measurable disease. Clinical activity was observed at all doses tested with durable Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) partial responses in a variety of tumor types. In the angiogenesis-sensitive group, objective RECIST response rate (complete response + partial response) was 26% (7 of 27) and progression-free survival (PFS) was 25 weeks. In assessable FGF-aberrant breast cancer patients, 50% (6 of 12) achieved RECIST partial response with a median PFS of 40.4 weeks for all treated patients. CONCLUSION: Lucitanib has promising efficacy and a manageable side-effect profile. The spectrum of activity observed demonstrates clinical benefit in both FGF-aberrant and angiogenesis-sensitive populations. A comprehensive phase II program is planned.

25194880|t|Amyloid-beta precursor protein facilitates the regulator of calcineurin 1-mediated apoptosis by downregulating proteasome subunit alpha type-5 and proteasome subunit beta type-7.
25194880|a|Individuals with Down syndrome (DS), caused by trisomy of chromosome 21, inevitably develop characteristic Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology, including neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal loss. Amyloid-beta protein, the major component of neuritic plaques, is the proteolytic product of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP). APP and the regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1) genes on chromosome 21 play a pivotal role in promoting plaque formation and neuronal apoptosis. However, the mechanism underlying AD pathogenesis in DS is not well defined. In this study, we demonstrated that APP significantly increased RCAN1 level in both cells and transgenic mice. Overexpression of APP significantly reduced the expression of 2 proteasome subunits, proteasome subunit alpha type-5 and proteasome subunit beta type-7, leading to the inhibition of proteasomal degradation of RCAN1. Furthermore, knockdown of RCAN1 expression attenuated APP-induced neuronal apoptosis. Taken together, the results clearly showed that APP has a previously unknown function in regulating RCAN1-mediated neuronal apoptosis through the proteasome pathway. Our study demonstrates a novel mechanism by which overexpression of APP and RCAN1 causes neurodegeneration and AD pathogenesis in DS, and it provides new insights into the potential of targeting APP-induced proteasomal impairment and RCAN1 accumulation for AD and DS treatment.

25195061|t|Abeta immunotherapy for Alzheimer's disease: effects on apoE and cerebral vasculopathy.
25195061|a|Abeta immunotherapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) results in the removal of Abeta plaques and increased cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). In current clinical trials, amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIAs), putatively due to exacerbation of CAA, are concerning side effects. We aimed to assess the role of the Abeta transporter apolipoprotein E (apoE) in the exacerbation of CAA and development of CAA-associated vasculopathy after Abeta immunotherapy. 12 Abeta42-immunized AD (iAD; AN1792, Elan Pharmaceuticals) cases were compared with 28 unimmunized AD (cAD) cases. Immunohistochemistry was quantified for Abeta42, apoE, apoE E4 and smooth muscle actin, and CAA-associated vasculopathy was analyzed. Abeta immunotherapy was associated with redistribution of apoE from cortical plaques to cerebral vessel walls, mirroring the altered distribution of Abeta42. Concentric vessel wall splitting was increased threefold in leptomeningeal vessels after immunotherapy (cAD 6.3 vs iAD 20.6 %, P < 0.001), but smooth muscle cell abnormalities did not differ. The findings suggest that apoE is involved in the removal of plaques and transport of Abeta to the cerebral vasculature induced by Abeta immunotherapy. Immunotherapy was not associated with CAA-related vascular smooth muscle damage, but was accompanied by increased splitting of the vessel wall, perhaps reflecting enhanced deposition and subsequent removal of Abeta. ARIA occurring in some current trials of Abeta immunotherapy may reflect an extreme form of these vascular changes.

25195528|t|Is radical nephrectomy a legitimate therapeutic option in patients with renal masses amenable to nephron-sparing surgery?
25195528|a|The decision to perform a radical nephrectomy (RN) or a partial nephrectomy (PN), not unlike most decisions in clinical practice, ultimately hinges on the balance of risk. Do the higher risks of a more complex surgery (PN) justify the theoretical benefits of kidney tissue preservation? Data suggest that for patients with an anatomically complex renal mass and a normal contralateral kidney, for whom additional surgical intensity may be risky, such as the elderly and comorbid, RN presents a robust treatment option. Nevertheless, PN, especially for small and anatomically simple renal masses in young patients without comorbidities should remain the surgical reference standard, as preservation of renal tissue can serve as an 'insurance policy' not only against future renal functional decline, but also against the possibility of tumour development in the contralateral kidney. In the present review, we outline the ongoing debate between the role of RN and PN in treatment of the enhancing renal mass.

25196776|t|Physician-reported barriers to referring cancer patients to specialists: prevalence, factors, and association with career satisfaction.
25196776|a|BACKGROUND: Quality care for patients with cancer often requires access to specialty providers, but little is known about barriers to referring cancer patients for specialized care. Referral barriers may also lessen physician career satisfaction. The study was aimed at determining what factors are associated with these barriers and whether greater barriers are associated with low career satisfaction. METHODS: This cross-sectional study examined 1562 primary care physicians (PCPs) and 2144 specialists responding to the multiregional Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance Consortium physician survey. The prevalence of physician-reported barriers to referring cancer patients for more specialized care (restricted provider networks, preauthorization requirements, patient inability to pay, lack of surgical subspecialists, and excessive patient travel time) was assessed. The 5 items were averaged to calculate a barrier score. A multivariate linear regression was used to determine physician and practice setting characteristics associated with the barrier score, and a multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the association of the barrier score with physician career satisfaction. RESULTS: Three in 5 physicians reported always, usually, or sometimes encountering any barrier to cancer patient specialty referrals. In adjusted analyses of PCPs and specialists, international medical graduates, physicians practicing in solo or government-owned practices, and physicians with <90% of their patients in managed care plans had higher barrier scores than others (P < .05). High barrier scores were associated with lower physician career satisfaction among PCPs and specialists (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Many physicians experience barriers to specialty referral for cancer patients. Uniform systems for providing and tracking timely referrals may enhance care and promote physician career satisfaction.

25197054|t|Crystal structure of the gamma-secretase component nicastrin.
25197054|a|gamma-Secretase is an intramembrane protease responsible for the generation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides. Aberrant accumulation of Abeta leads to the formation of amyloid plaques in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Nicastrin is the putative substrate-recruiting component of the gamma-secretase complex. No atomic-resolution structure had been identified on gamma-secretase or any of its four components, hindering mechanistic understanding of gamma-secretase function. Here we report the crystal structure of nicastrin from Dictyostelium purpureum at 1.95-A resolution. The extracellular domain of nicastrin contains a large lobe and a small lobe. The large lobe of nicastrin, thought to be responsible for substrate recognition, associates with the small lobe through a hydrophobic pivot at the center. The putative substrate-binding pocket is shielded from the small lobe by a lid, which blocks substrate entry. These structural features suggest a working model of nicastrin function. Analysis of nicastrin structure provides insights into the assembly and architecture of the gamma-secretase complex.

25198136|t|Alzheimer peptides aggregate into transient nanoglobules that nucleate fibrils.
25198136|a|Protein/peptide oligomerization, cross-beta strand fibrillation, and amyloid deposition play a critical role in many diseases, but despite extensive biophysical characterization, the structural and dynamic details of oligomerization and fibrillation of amyloidic peptides/proteins remain to be fully clarified. Here, we simultaneously monitored the atomic, molecular, and mesoscopic states of aggregating Alzheimer's amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides over time, using a slow aggregation protocol and a fast aggregation protocol, and determined the cytotoxicity of the intermediate states. We show that in the early stage of fast fibrillation (the lag phase) the Abeta peptides coalesced into apparently unstructured globules (15-200 nm in diameter), which slowly grew larger. Then a sharp transition occurred, characterized by the first appearance of single fibrillar structures of approximately >=100 nm. These fibrils emerged from the globules. Simultaneously, an increase was observed for the cross-beta strand conformation that is characteristic of the fibrils that constitute mature amyloid. The number and size of single fibrils rapidly increased. Eventually, the fibrils coalesced into mature amyloid. Samples from the early lag phase of slow fibrillation conditions were especially toxic to cells, and this toxicity sharply decreased when fibrils formed and matured into amyloid. Our results suggest that the formation of fibrils may protect cells by reducing the toxic structures that appear in the early lag phase of fibrillation.

25198420|t|Microscopic hydration properties of the abeta1-42 Peptide monomer and the globular protein ubiquitin: a comparative molecular dynamics study.
25198420|a|Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of eight selected conformations of a disordered protein, amyloid beta (1-42) (Abeta), and a globular protein, ubiquitin (UBQ), have been carried out in aqueous media at 310 K. Detailed analyses were carried out to compare the microscopic properties of water molecules present in the hydration layers of these systems. It is noticed that irrespective of the conformational heterogeneity among the Abeta monomers, water molecules hydrating their surfaces exhibit relatively faster dynamics as compared to water molecules hydrating UBQ. Importantly, the conformational heterogeneity of the Abeta monomers has been found to affect the translational and rotational motions of hydration water molecules in a nonuniform manner. Detailed investigation of the timescale of hydrogen bond relaxations at the surface and their energetics revealed the possibility of heterogeneous confinement around different Abeta conformations. The distribution of water density fluctuation around Abeta conformations are broader compared to UBQ because of its predominant hydrophobic nature. Significant heterogeneity in the density fluctuation among the Abeta monomers suggests that the structural propensities could affect the peptide's effective surface hydrophobicity.

25199842|t|Effects of multiple genetic loci on age at onset in late-onset Alzheimer disease: a genome-wide association study.
25199842|a|IMPORTANCE: Because APOE locus variants contribute to risk of late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) and to differences in age at onset (AAO), it is important to know whether other established LOAD risk loci also affect AAO in affected participants. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of known Alzheimer disease risk loci in modifying AAO and to estimate their cumulative effect on AAO variation using data from genome-wide association studies in the Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium comprises 14 case-control, prospective, and family-based data sets with data on 9162 participants of white race/ethnicity with Alzheimer disease occurring after age 60 years who also had complete AAO information, gathered between 1989 and 2011 at multiple sites by participating studies. Data on genotyped or imputed single-nucleotide polymorphisms most significantly associated with risk at 10 confirmed LOAD loci were examined in linear modeling of AAO, and individual data set results were combined using a random-effects, inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis approach to determine whether they contribute to variation in AAO. Aggregate effects of all risk loci on AAO were examined in a burden analysis using genotype scores weighted by risk effect sizes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Age at disease onset abstracted from medical records among participants with LOAD diagnosed per standard criteria. RESULTS: Analysis confirmed the association of APOE with earlier AAO (P = 3.3 x 10(-96)), with associations in CR1 (rs6701713, P = 7.2 x 10(-4)), BIN1 (rs7561528, P = 4.8 x 10(-4)), and PICALM (rs561655, P = 2.2 x 10(-3)) reaching statistical significance (P < .005). Risk alleles individually reduced AAO by 3 to 6 months. Burden analyses demonstrated that APOE contributes to 3.7% of the variation in AAO (R(2) = 0.256) over baseline (R(2) = 0.221), whereas the other 9 loci together contribute to 2.2% of the variation (R(2) = 0.242). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We confirmed an association of APOE (OMIM 107741) variants with AAO among affected participants with LOAD and observed novel associations of CR1 (OMIM 120620), BIN1 (OMIM 601248), and PICALM (OMIM 603025) with AAO. In contrast to earlier hypothetical modeling, we show that the combined effects of Alzheimer disease risk variants on AAO are on the scale of, but do not exceed, the APOE effect. While the aggregate effects of risk loci on AAO may be significant, additional genetic contributions to AAO are individually likely to be small.

25201514|t|Age-specific population frequencies of cerebral beta-amyloidosis and neurodegeneration among people with normal cognitive function aged 50-89 years: a cross-sectional study.
25201514|a|BACKGROUND: As preclinical Alzheimer's disease becomes a target for therapeutic intervention, the overlap between imaging abnormalities associated with typical ageing and those associated with Alzheimer's disease needs to be recognised. We aimed to characterise how typical ageing and preclinical Alzheimer's disease overlap in terms of beta-amyloidosis and neurodegeneration. METHODS: We measured age-specific frequencies of amyloidosis and neurodegeneration in individuals with normal cognitive function aged 50-89 years. Potential participants were randomly selected from the Olmsted County (MN, USA) population-based study of cognitive ageing and invited to participate in cognitive and imaging assessments. To be eligible for inclusion, individuals must have been judged clinically to have no cognitive impairment and have undergone amyloid PET, (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) PET, and MRI. Imaging results were obtained from March 28, 2006, to Dec 3, 2013. Amyloid status (positive [A(+)] or negative [A(-)]) was determined by amyloid PET with (11)C Pittsburgh compound B. Neurodegeneration status (positive [N(+)] or negative [N(-)]) was determined by an Alzheimer's disease signature (18)F-FDG PET or hippocampal volume on MRI. We determined age-specific frequencies of the four groups (amyloid negative and neurodegeneration negative [A(-)N(-)], amyloid positive and neurodegeneration negative [A(+)N(-)], amyloid negative and neurodegeneration positive [A(-)N(+)], or amyloid positive and neurodegeneration positive [A(+)N(+)]) cross-sectionally using multinomial regression models. We also investigated associations of group frequencies with APOE e4 status (assessed with DNA extracted from blood) and sex by including these covariates in the multinomial models. FINDINGS: The study population consisted of 985 eligible participants. The population frequency of A(-)N(-) was 100% (n=985) at age 50 years and fell to 17% (95% CI 11-24) by age 89 years. The frequency of A(+)N(-) increased to 28% (24-32) at age 74 years, then decreased to 17% (11-25) by age 89 years. The frequency of A(-)N(+) increased from age 60 years, reaching 24% (16-34) by age 89 years. The frequency of A(+)N(+) increased from age 65 years, reaching 42% (31-52) by age 89 years. The results from our multinomial models suggest that A(+)N(-) and A(+)N(+) were more frequent in APOE e4 carriers than in non-carriers and that A(+)N(+) was more, and A(+)N(-) less frequent in men than in women. INTERPRETATION: Accumulation of amyloid and neurodegeneration are nearly inevitable by old age, but many people are able to maintain normal cognitive function despite these imaging abnormalities. Changes in the frequency of amyloidosis and neurodegeneration with age, which seem to be modified by APOE e4 and sex, suggest that pathophysiological sequences might differ between individuals.

25202927|t|Enhancement of beta-amyloid oligomer accumulation after intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin, which involves central insulin signaling in a transgenic mouse model.
25202927|a|The beta-amyloid (Abeta) oligomer rather than fibrillar Abeta has become the important focus of recent studies on the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Insulin signaling plays important roles in cognitive disease, such as AD. However, in-vivo evidence for the link between central insulin signaling and the Abeta oligomer are lacking, and the mechanisms underlying the effect of central insulin signaling on AD are still elusive. Our team has established the Presenilin-1 Val97Leu mutant transgenic (PS1V97L) AD mouse model with the intraneuronal Abeta oligomer as the potential initiator for other pathologies, but without extracellular amyloid plaque formation. Using this model, we investigated the roles of disturbed central insulin signaling induced by intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin (STZ) in the progression of AD. We observed that PS1V97L mice after intracerebroventricular injection of STZ showed increased Abeta oligomer accumulation and aggravated spatial learning and memory deficit in the absence of diabetes symptoms. Furthermore, STZ administration inhibited the activation of the insulin receptor and enhanced the activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, which was accompanied by increased production of carboxy-terminal fragments from the amyloid precursor protein, in the brain of PS1V97L mice. Overall, our study provided in-vivo evidence for a role of central insulin signaling in AD progression.

25203987|t|Supervised multi-view canonical correlation analysis (sMVCCA): integrating histologic and proteomic features for predicting recurrent prostate cancer.
25203987|a|In this work, we present a new methodology to facilitate prediction of recurrent prostate cancer (CaP) following radical prostatectomy (RP) via the integration of quantitative image features and protein expression in the excised prostate. Creating a fused predictor from high-dimensional data streams is challenging because the classifier must 1) account for the "curse of dimensionality" problem, which hinders classifier performance when the number of features exceeds the number of patient studies and 2) balance potential mismatches in the number of features across different channels to avoid classifier bias towards channels with more features. Our new data integration methodology, supervised Multi-view Canonical Correlation Analysis (sMVCCA), aims to integrate infinite views of highdimensional data to provide more amenable data representations for disease classification. Additionally, we demonstrate sMVCCA using Spearman's rank correlation which, unlike Pearson's correlation, can account for nonlinear correlations and outliers. Forty CaP patients with pathological Gleason scores 6-8 were considered for this study. 21 of these men revealed biochemical recurrence (BCR) following RP, while 19 did not. For each patient, 189 quantitative histomorphometric attributes and 650 protein expression levels were extracted from the primary tumor nodule. The fused histomorphometric/proteomic representation via sMVCCA combined with a random forest classifier predicted BCR with a mean AUC of 0.74 and a maximum AUC of 0.9286. We found sMVCCA to perform statistically significantly (p < 0.05) better than comparative state-of-the-art data fusion strategies for predicting BCR. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated improved BCR-free survival prediction for the sMVCCA-fused classifier as compared to histology or proteomic features alone.

25204284|t|Impairment of paravascular clearance pathways in the aging brain.
25204284|a|OBJECTIVE: In the brain, protein waste removal is partly performed by paravascular pathways that facilitate convective exchange of water and soluble contents between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and interstitial fluid (ISF). Several lines of evidence suggest that bulk flow drainage via the glymphatic system is driven by cerebrovascular pulsation, and is dependent on astroglial water channels that line paravascular CSF pathways. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the efficiency of CSF-ISF exchange and interstitial solute clearance is impaired in the aging brain. METHODS: CSF-ISF exchange was evaluated by in vivo and ex vivo fluorescence microscopy and interstitial solute clearance was evaluated by radiotracer clearance assays in young (2-3 months), middle-aged (10-12 months), and old (18-20 months) wild-type mice. The relationship between age-related changes in the expression of the astrocytic water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4) and changes in glymphatic pathway function was evaluated by immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Advancing age was associated with a dramatic decline in the efficiency of exchange between the subarachnoid CSF and the brain parenchyma. Relative to the young, clearance of intraparenchymally injected amyloid-beta was impaired by 40% in the old mice. A 27% reduction in the vessel wall pulsatility of intracortical arterioles and widespread loss of perivascular AQP4 polarization along the penetrating arteries accompanied the decline in CSF-ISF exchange. INTERPRETATION: We propose that impaired glymphatic clearance contributes to cognitive decline among the elderly and may represent a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases associated with accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates.

25204313|t|Induction of GADD34 Regulates the Neurotoxicity of Amyloid beta.
25204313|a|The possible roles played by growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene 34 (GADD34) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are so far less understood. In this study, we found that GADD34 was increased in the brains of AD transgenic J20 mice. The deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide is the main component of neurotic plaques in AD brain. Thus, we examined the effect of Abeta in the expression of GADD34 in human SH-SY5Y cells in vitro. Amyloid beta (Abeta1-42) treatment led to increased expression of GADD34. Pretreatment with 50 nmol/L of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) inhibitor SP600125 abolished the upregulation of GADD34. c-Jun silencing by transfection with c-Jun small-interfering RNA abolished the effects of Abeta1-42 on the expression of GADD34. Importantly, chromatin immunoprecipitation studies verified the ability of c-Jun to bind to the GADD34 promoter, and this ability was increased more than 3-fold by Abeta1-42. These data suggest that the induction of GADD34 by Abeta is mediated by JNK/c-Jun pathway. Finally, depletion of GADD34 significantly rescued Abeta-induced cell apoptosis as evidenced by a marked decrease in the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells. Consistently, knockdown of GADD34 attenuated caspase 3 activation induced by Abeta1-42.

25204716|t|Astrocytes and microglia but not neurons preferentially generate N-terminally truncated Abeta peptides.
25204716|a|The neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease include extracellular neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The neuritic plaques contain beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta peptides) as the major proteinaceous constituent and are surrounded by activated microglia and astrocytes as well as dystrophic neurites. N-terminally truncated forms of Abeta peptides are highly prevalent in neuritic plaques, including Abeta 3-x beginning at Glu eventually modified to pyroglutamate (Abeta N3pE-x), Abeta 2-x, Abeta 4-x, and Abeta 5-x. The precise origin of the different N-terminally modified Abeta peptides currently remains unknown. To assess the contribution of specific cell types to the formation of different N-terminally truncated Abeta peptides, supernatants from serum-free primary cell cultures of chicken neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, as well as human astrocytes, were analyzed by Abeta-ELISA and one- and two-dimensional SDS-urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblot analysis. To evaluate the contribution of beta- and gamma-secretase to the generation of N-terminally modified Abeta, cultured astrocytes were treated with membrane-anchored "tripartite beta-secretase (BACE1) inhibitors" and the gamma-secretase inhibitor DAPT. Neurons, astrocytes, and microglia each exhibited cell type-specific patterns of secreted Abeta peptides. Neurons predominantly secreted Abeta peptides that begin at Asp1, whereas those released from astrocytes and microglia included high proportions of N-terminally modified Abeta peptides, presumably including Abeta 2/3-x and 4/5-x. The inhibition of BACE1 reduced the amount of Abeta 1-x in cell culture supernatants but not the amount of Abeta 2-x.

25205302|t|Coupling of prostate and thyroid cancer diagnoses in the United States.
25205302|a|BACKGROUND: Prostate and thyroid cancers represent two of the most overdiagnosed tumors in the US. Hypothesizing that patients diagnosed with one of these malignancies were more likely to be diagnosed with the other, we examined the coupling of diagnoses of prostate and thyroid cancer in a large US administrative dataset. METHODS: The surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (SEER) database was used to identify men diagnosed with clinically localized prostate cancer (CaP) or thyroid cancer between 1995 and 2010. SEER*stat software was used to estimate multivariable-adjusted standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and investigate the rates of subsequent malignancy diagnosis. Additional non-urologic cancer sites were added as control groups. RESULTS: Patients with thyroid cancer were much more likely to be diagnosed with CaP than patients in the SEER control group (SIR 1.28 [95% CI 1.1-1.5]; p < 0.05). Similarly, the observed incidence of thyroid cancer was significantly higher in patients with CaP when compared with SEER controls (SIR 1.30 [95% CI 1.2-1.4]; p < 0.05). When stratified by follow-up interval, the observed thyroid cancer diagnosis rate among men with CaP was significantly higher than expected at 2-11 (SIR 1.83 [95% CI 1.4-2.4]), 12-59 (SIR 1.24 [95% CI 1.0-1.5]), and 60-119 (SIR 1.25 [95% CI 1.0-1.5]) months of follow-up. There was no increased risk of CaP or thyroid cancer diagnosis among patients with non-urologic malignancies. CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant association of diagnoses with prostate and thyroid cancer in the US. In the absence of a known biological link between these tumors, these data suggest that diagnosis patterns for prostate and thyroid malignancies are linked.

25205593|t|Amyloid-beta efflux from the central nervous system into the plasma.
25205593|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to measure the flux of amyloid-beta (Abeta) across the human cerebral capillary bed to determine whether transport into the blood is a significant mechanism of clearance for Abeta produced in the central nervous system (CNS). METHODS: Time-matched blood samples were simultaneously collected from a cerebral vein (including the sigmoid sinus, inferior petrosal sinus, and the internal jugular vein), femoral vein, and radial artery of patients undergoing inferior petrosal sinus sampling. For each plasma sample, Abeta concentration was assessed by 3 assays, and the venous to arterial Abeta concentration ratios were determined. RESULTS: Abeta concentration was increased by ~7.5% in venous blood leaving the CNS capillary bed compared to arterial blood, indicating efflux from the CNS into the peripheral blood (p < 0.0001). There was no difference in peripheral venous Abeta concentration compared to arterial blood concentration. INTERPRETATION: Our results are consistent with clearance of CNS-derived Abeta into the venous blood supply with no increase from a peripheral capillary bed. Modeling these results suggests that direct transport of Abeta across the blood-brain barrier accounts for ~25% of Abeta clearance, and reabsorption of cerebrospinal fluid Abeta accounts for ~25% of the total CNS Abeta clearance in humans.

25206748|t|Lipid rafts participate in aberrant degradative autophagic-lysosomal pathway of amyloid-beta peptide in Alzheimer's disease.
25206748|a|Amyloid-beta peptide is the main component of amyloid plaques, which are found in Alzheimer's disease. The generation and deposition of amyloid-beta is one of the crucial factors for the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease. Lipid rafts are glycolipid-rich liquid domains of the plasma membrane, where certain types of protein tend to aggregate and intercalate. Lipid rafts are involved in the generation of amyloid-beta oligomers and the formation of amyloid-beta peptides. In this paper, we review the mechanism by which lipid rafts disturb the aberrant degradative autophagic-lysosomal pathway of amyloid-beta, which plays an important role in the pathological process of Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, we describe this mechanism from the view of the Two-system Theory of fasciology and thus, suggest that lipid rafts may be a new target of Alzheimer's disease treatment.

25206831|t|7.0T nuclear magnetic resonance evaluation of the amyloid beta (1-40) animal model of Alzheimer's disease: comparison of cytology verification.
25206831|a|3.0T magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging is a commonly used method in the research of brain function in Alzheimer's disease. However, the role of 7.0T high-field magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging in brain function of Alzheimer's disease remains unclear. In this study, 7.0T magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed that in the hippocampus of Alzheimer's disease rats, the N-acetylaspartate wave crest was reduced, and the creatine and choline wave crest was elevated. This finding was further supported by hematoxylin-eosin staining, which showed a loss of hippocampal neurons and more glial cells. Moreover, electron microscopy showed neuronal shrinkage and mitochondrial rupture, and scanning electron microscopy revealed small size hippocampal synaptic vesicles, incomplete synaptic structure, and reduced number. Overall, the results revealed that 7.0T high-field nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy detected the lesions and functional changes in hippocampal neurons of Alzheimer's disease rats in vivo, allowing the possibility for assessing the success rate and grading of the amyloid beta (1-40) animal model of Alzheimer's disease.

25207746|t|The binding of apolipoprotein E to oligomers and fibrils of amyloid-beta alters the kinetics of amyloid aggregation.
25207746|a|Deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is strongly correlated with the APOE genotype. However, the role of apolipoprotein E (apoE) in Abeta aggregation has remained unclear. Here we have used different apoE preparations, such as recombinant protein or protein isolated from cultured astrocytes, to examine the effect of apoE on the aggregation of both Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42. The kinetics of aggregation, measured by the loss of fluorescence of tetramethylrhodamine-labeled Abeta, is shown to be dramatically slowed by the presence of substoichiometric concentrations of apoE. Using these concentrations, we conclude that apoE binds primarily to and affects the growth of oligomers that lead to the nuclei required for fibril growth. At higher apoE concentrations, the protein also binds to Abeta fibrils, resulting in fibril stabilization and a slower rate of fibril growth. The aggregation of Abeta1-40 is dependent on the apoE isoform, being the most dramatic for apoE4 and less so for apoE3 and apoE2. Our results indicate that the detrimental role of apoE4 in AD could be related to apoE-induced stabilization of the soluble but cytotoxic oligomeric forms and intermediates of Abeta, as well as fibril stabilization.

25209273|t|Differential release of beta-amyloid from dendrite- versus axon-targeted APP.
25209273|a|The beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. APP is processed in neurons, but little is known about the relative contributions of presynaptic or postsynaptic compartments to the release of Abeta peptides. To address this issue, we transduced primary neurons from Sprague-Dawley rats or APP(-/-) mice (B6.129S7-App(tm1Dbo)/J) with lentiviral constructs expressing APP chimeras harboring targeting motifs from low-density lipoprotein receptor or neuron-glia cell-adhesion molecule to polarize expression to either dendritic or axonal membranes, respectively. Using imaging and quantitative biochemical approaches, we now report that APP selectively targeted to either axons or dendrites leads to the secretion of full-length Abeta peptides with significantly elevated release from dendritic compartments. These findings reveal that the enzymatic machinery required for production of Abeta peptides are operative both in presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments of primary neurons, leading to the suggestion that Abeta-mediated impairments in glutamatergic neurotransmission is the result of Abeta release from both local and distal neuronal compartments.

25209291|t|Opposing effects of membrane-anchored CX3CL1 on amyloid and tau pathologies via the p38 MAPK pathway.
25209291|a|Several Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk genes are specifically expressed by microglia within the CNS. However, the mechanisms by which microglia regulate the pathological hallmarks of AD--extracellular deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) and intraneuronal hyperphosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT)--remain to be established. Notably, deficiency for the microglial CX3CR1 receptor has opposing effects on Abeta and MAPT pathologies. CX3CL1, the neuronally derived cognate ligand for CX3CR1, signals both in membrane-anchored and soluble forms. In this study, we sought to determine the relative contribution on membrane-anchored versus soluble CX3CL1 in regulating the microglia-mediated amelioration of Abeta pathology, as well as provide insight into the potential downstream microglial-based mechanisms. As expected, CX3CL1 deficiency reduced Abeta deposition in APPPS1 animals in a similar manner to CX3CR1 deficiency. Surprisingly, however, CX3CL1-deficient APPPS1 animals exhibited enhanced neuronal MAPT phosphorylation despite reduced amyloid burden. Importantly, neither of these phenotypes was altered by transgenic expression of the soluble CX3CL1 isoform, suggesting that it is the membrane-anchored version of CX3CL1 that regulates microglial phagocytosis of Abeta and neuronal MAPT phosphorylation. Analysis of transcript levels in purified microglia isolated from APPPS1 mice with the various CX3CL1/CX3CR1 genotypes revealed increased expression of inflammatory cytokines and phagocytic markers, which was associated with activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and Abeta internalization within microglia. Together, these studies challenge the "frustrated phagocytosis" concept and suggest that neuronal-microglial communication link the two central AD pathologies.

25212850|t|Highly potent soluble amyloid-beta seeds in human Alzheimer brain but not cerebrospinal fluid.
25212850|a|The soluble fraction of brain samples from patients with Alzheimer's disease contains highly biologically active amyloid-beta seeds. In this study, we sought to assess the potency of soluble amyloid-beta seeds derived from the brain and cerebrospinal fluid. Soluble Alzheimer's disease brain extracts were serially diluted and then injected into the hippocampus of young, APP transgenic mice. Eight months later, seeded amyloid-beta deposition was evident even when the hippocampus received subattomole amounts of brain-derived amyloid-beta. In contrast, cerebrospinal fluid from patients with Alzheimer's disease, which contained more than 10-fold higher levels of amyloid-beta peptide than the most concentrated soluble brain extracts, did not induce detectable seeding activity in vivo. Similarly, cerebrospinal fluid from aged APP-transgenic donor mice failed to induce cerebral amyloid-beta deposition. In comparison to the soluble brain fraction, cerebrospinal fluid largely lacked N-terminally truncated amyloid-beta species and exhibited smaller amyloid-beta-positive particles, features that may contribute to the lack of in vivo seeding by cerebrospinal fluid. Interestingly, the same cerebrospinal fluid showed at least some seeding activity in an in vitro assay. The present results indicate that the biological seeding activity of soluble amyloid-beta species is orders of magnitude greater in brain extracts than in the cerebrospinal fluid.

25212913|t|Different effect of vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 on amyloid-beta40 aggregation in vitro.
25212913|a|The seeding of amyloid-beta 40 (Abeta40) oligomers from monomers is the initial step of Abeta aggregation, and many reports have suggested that cholesterol enhances this step. We studied the potential of secosteroid vitamin D derivatives for Abeta40 aggregation in vitro. The quartz-crystal microbalance technique demonstrated that vitamin D3 does not show any effect on Abeta40 aggregation while vitamin D2 promoted it and docking simulation but that vitamin D2 has high potential in this regard. Thus, stacking of the Phe19 benzene ring in Abeta40 and the C22-C23 double bond in vitamin D2 may alter the energy of these molecules. Electron microscopy revealed the potential of vitamin D2 to increase Abeta40 aggregation. Thioflavin-T assays indicated that Vitamin D2 induced increased fluorescence at 490 nm, as typically observed for amyloid fibrils but also for protofibrils; in both cases this reflects of the increase of beta-sheet contents. Abeta40 aggregation was further confirmed in ELISA, SDS-PAGE and dot blot analysis which revealed changes in protease K resistance. These results suggest a possible mechanism, of how vitamin D2 could increase Abeta40 aggregation and the docking simulation explains, why the same is not observed with vitamin D3.

25213090|t|Temporal gene profiling of the 5XFAD transgenic mouse model highlights the importance of microglial activation in Alzheimer's disease.
25213090|a|BACKGROUND: The 5XFAD early onset mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is gaining momentum. Behavioral, electrophysiological and anatomical studies have identified age-dependent alterations that can be reminiscent of human AD. However, transcriptional changes during disease progression have not yet been investigated. To this end, we carried out a transcriptomic analysis on RNAs from the neocortex and the hippocampus of 5XFAD female mice at the ages of one, four, six and nine months (M1, M4, M6, M9). RESULTS: Our results show a clear shift in gene expression patterns between M1 and M4. At M1, 5XFAD animals exhibit region-specific variations in gene expression patterns whereas M4 to M9 mice share a larger proportion of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that are common to both regions. Analysis of DEGs from M4 to M9 underlines the predominance of inflammatory and immune processes in this AD mouse model. The rise in inflammation, sustained by the overexpression of genes from the complement and integrin families, is accompanied by an increased expression of transcripts involved in the NADPH oxidase complex, phagocytic processes and IFN-gamma related pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our data suggest that, from M4 to M9, sustained microglial activation becomes the predominant feature and point out that both detrimental and neuroprotective mechanisms appear to be at play in this model. Furthermore, our study identifies a number of genes already known to be altered in human AD, thus confirming the use of the 5XFAD strain as a valid model for understanding AD pathogenesis and for screening potential therapeutic molecules.

25214542|t|The evaluation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in breast cancer: recommendations by an International TILs Working Group 2014.
25214542|a|BACKGROUND: The morphological evaluation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in breast cancer (BC) is gaining momentum as evidence strengthens for the clinical relevance of this immunological biomarker. Accumulating evidence suggests that the extent of lymphocytic infiltration in tumor tissue can be assessed as a major parameter by evaluation of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tumor sections. TILs have been shown to provide prognostic and potentially predictive value, particularly in triple-negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-overexpressing BC. DESIGN: A standardized methodology for evaluating TILs is now needed as a prerequisite for integrating this parameter in standard histopathological practice, in a research setting as well as in clinical trials. This article reviews current data on the clinical validity and utility of TILs in BC in an effort to foster better knowledge and insight in this rapidly evolving field, and to develop a standardized methodology for visual assessment on H&E sections, acknowledging the future potential of molecular/multiplexed approaches. CONCLUSIONS: The methodology provided is sufficiently detailed to offer a uniformly applied, pragmatic starting point and improve consistency and reproducibility in the measurement of TILs for future studies.

25216972|t|Time-dependent variation in the responses to the web-based ISAAC questionnaire.
25216972|a|BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies have shown seasonal variations in responses to the written questionnaire for rhinitis symptoms. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the timing of data collection affected responses to the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire in a Web-based study. METHODS: The Web-based ISAAC questionnaires were completed by parents with children 6 to 12 years old using an online research system. The authors conducted surveys of asthma symptoms every month for 1 year and surveys of rhinitis and eczema symptoms every season throughout 1 entire year. RESULTS: There was a significant fluctuation in the positive responses to questions about wheezing in the past 12 months (P < .001) but not in the positive responses to questions about exercise-induced wheezing in the past 12 months and asthma ever (P = .75 and P = .15, respectively). The positive responses to questions about rhinitis and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis in the past 12 months and pollinosis ever exhibited significant seasonal variations (P = .002, P < .001, and P < .001, respectively). In contrast, there were no significant variations in positive responses regarding eczema in the past 12 months and eczema ever (P = .33 and P = .55, respectively). CONCLUSION: There were time-dependent fluctuations in responses to the Web-based questionnaire regarding allergic symptoms. Timing of data collection should be taken into account when evaluating prevalence of asthma and rhinitis in children.

25217638|t|Interaction of the molecular chaperone DNAJB6 with growing amyloid-beta 42 (Abeta42) aggregates leads to sub-stoichiometric inhibition of amyloid formation.
25217638|a|The human molecular chaperone protein DNAJB6 was recently found to inhibit the formation of amyloid fibrils from polyglutamine peptides associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington disease. We show in the present study that DNAJB6 also inhibits amyloid formation by an even more aggregation-prone peptide (the amyloid-beta peptide, Abeta42, implicated in Alzheimer disease) in a highly efficient manner. By monitoring fibril formation using Thioflavin T fluorescence and far-UV CD spectroscopy, we have found that the aggregation of Abeta42 is retarded by DNAJB6 in a concentration-dependent manner, extending to very low sub-stoichiometric molar ratios of chaperone to peptide. Quantitative kinetic analysis and immunochemistry studies suggest that the high inhibitory efficiency is due to the interactions of the chaperone with aggregated forms of Abeta42 rather than the monomeric form of the peptide. This interaction prevents the growth of such species to longer fibrils and inhibits the formation of new amyloid fibrils through both primary and secondary nucleation. A low dissociation rate of DNAJB6 from Abeta42 aggregates leads to its incorporation into growing fibrils and hence to its gradual depletion from solution with time. When DNAJB6 is eventually depleted, fibril proliferation takes place, but the inhibitory activity can be prolonged by introducing DNAJB6 at regular intervals during the aggregation reaction. These results reveal the highly efficacious mode of action of this molecular chaperone against protein aggregation, and demonstrate that the role of molecular chaperones can involve interactions with multiple aggregated species leading to the inhibition of both principal nucleation pathways through which aggregates are able to form.

25217640|t|Amyloid-beta pathology and APOE genotype modulate retinoid X receptor agonist activity in vivo.
25217640|a|Previous data demonstrate that bexarotene (Bex), retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonist, reduces soluble and insoluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) in Alzheimer disease (AD)-transgenic mice either by increasing the levels of mouse apolipoprotein E (apoE) or increasing ABCA1/ABCG1-induced apoE lipoprotein association/lipidation. However, although the mechanism of action of RXR agonists remains unclear, a major concern for their use is human (h)-APOE4, the greatest AD genetic risk factor. If APOE4 imparts a toxic gain-of-function, then increasing apoE4 may increase soluble Abeta, likely the proximal AD neurotoxin. If the APOE4 loss-of-function is lipidation of apoE4, then induction of ABCA1/ABCG1 may be beneficial. In novel EFAD-Tg mice (overexpressing h-Abeta42 with h-APOE), levels of soluble Abeta (Abeta42 and oligomeric Abeta) are highest in E4FAD hippocampus (HP) > E3FAD-HP > E4FAD cortex (CX) > E3FAD-CX, whereas levels of lipoprotein-associated/lipidated apoE have the opposite pattern (6 months). In E4FAD-HP, short-term RXR agonist treatment (Bex or LG100268; 5.75-6 months) increased ABCA1, apoE4 lipoprotein-association/lipidation, and apoE4/Abeta complex, decreased soluble Abeta, and increased PSD95. In addition, hydrogel delivery, which mimics low sustained release, was equally effective as gavage for Bex and LG100268. RXR agonists induced no beneficial effects in the E4FAD-HP in a prevention protocol (5-6 months) and actually increased soluble Abeta levels in E3FAD-CX and E4FAD-CX with the short-term protocol, possibly the result of systemic hepatomegaly. Thus, RXR agonists address the loss-of-function associated with APOE4 and exacerbated by Abeta pathology, i.e. low levels of apoE4 lipoprotein association/lipidation. Further studies are vital to address whether RXR agonists are an APOE4-specific AD therapeutic and the systemic side effects that limit translational application.

25217641|t|Neurogenin 2 mediates amyloid-beta precursor protein-stimulated neurogenesis.
25217641|a|Amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) is well studied for its role in Alzheimer disease, although its normal function remains uncertain. It has been reported that APP stimulates the proliferation and neuronal differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs). In this study we examined the role of APP in NSPC differentiation. To identify proteins that may mediate the effect of APP on NSPC differentiation, we used a gene array approach to find genes whose expression correlated with APP-induced neurogenesis. We found that the expression of neurogenin 2 (Ngn2), a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, was significantly down-regulated in NSPCs from APP knock-out mice (APPKO) and increased in APP transgenic (Tg2576) mice. Ngn2 overexpression in APPKO NSPCs promoted neuronal differentiation, whereas siRNA knockdown of Ngn2 expression in wild-type NSPCs decreased neuronal differentiation. The results demonstrate that APP-stimulated neuronal differentiation of NSPCs is mediated by Ngn2.

25217827|t|Neural compensation in older people with brain amyloid-beta deposition.
25217827|a|Recruitment of extra neural resources may allow people to maintain normal cognition despite amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques. Previous fMRI studies have reported such hyperactivation, but it is unclear whether increases represent compensation or aberrant overexcitation. We found that older adults with Abeta deposition had reduced deactivations in task-negative regions, but increased activation in task-positive regions related to more detailed memory encoding. The association between higher activity and more detailed memories suggests that Abeta-related hyperactivation is compensatory.

25218219|t|The natural basil flavonoid nevadensin protects against a methyleugenol-induced marker of hepatocarcinogenicity in male F344 rat.
25218219|a|The alkenylbenzene methyleugenol occurs naturally in a variety of spices and herbs, including basil, and their essential oils. At high dose levels methyleugenol induces hepatocarcinogenicity in rodents following bioactivation to 1'-sulfooxymethyleugenol which forms DNA adducts. This study investigated whether the inhibitory effect of the basil flavonoid nevadensin on sulfotransferase (SULT)-mediated bioactivation of methyleugenol observed in vitro would also be reflected in a reduction of DNA adduct formation and a reduction in an early marker for liver carcinogenesis in an 8-week rat study. Co-exposure to methyleugenol and nevadensin orally resulted in a significant inhibition of liver methyleugenol DNA adduct formation and in inhibition of hepatocellular altered foci induction, representing indicators for initiation of neoplasia. These results suggest that tumor formation could be lower in rodent bioassays when methyleugenol would be dosed in a matrix containing SULT inhibitors such as nevadensin compared to experiments using the pure methyleugenol.

25218471|t|Amyloid precursor protein regulates migration and metalloproteinase gene expression in prostate cancer cells.
25218471|a|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a type I transmembrane protein, and one of its processed forms, beta-amyloid, is considered to play a central role in the development of Alzheimer's disease. We previously showed that APP is a primary androgen-responsive gene in prostate cancer and that its increased expression is correlated with poor prognosis for patients with prostate cancer. APP has also been implicated in several human malignancies. Nevertheless, the mechanism underlying the pro-proliferative effects of APP on cancers is still not well-understood. In the present study, we explored a pathophysiological role for APP in prostate cancer cells using siRNA targeting APP (siAPP). The proliferation and migration of LNCaP and DU145 prostate cancer cells were significantly suppressed by siAPP. Differentially expressed genes in siAPP-treated cells compared to control siRNA-treated cells were identified by microarray analysis. Notably, several metalloproteinase genes, such as ADAM10 and ADAM17, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes, such as VIM, and SNAI2, were downregulated in siAPP-treated cells as compared to control cells. The expression of these genes was upregulated in LNCaP cells stably expressing APP when compared with control cells. APP-overexpressing LNCaP cells exhibited enhanced migration in comparison to control cells. These results suggest that APP may contribute to the proliferation and migration of prostate cancer cells by modulating the expression of metalloproteinase and EMT-related genes.

25219962|t|An improved capillary electrophoresis method for in vitro monitoring of the challenging early steps of Abeta1-42 peptide oligomerization: application to anti-Alzheimer's drug discovery.
25219962|a|We report an improved CE method to monitor in vitro the self-assembly of monomeric amyloid beta-peptide (42 amino acids amyloid beta-peptide, Abeta1-42 ) and in particular the crucial early steps involved in the formation of the neurotoxic oligomers. In order to start the kinetics from the beginning, sample preparation was optimized to provide samples containing exclusively the monomeric form. The CE method was also improved using a dynamic coating and by reducing the separation distance. Using this method, the disappearance of the monomer as well as the progressive formation of four species during the self-assembly process can now be monitored and quantified over time. The hydrodynamic radius of the species present at the initial kinetics step was estimated around 1.8 nm by Taylor dispersion analysis while SDS-PAGE analyses showed the predominance of the monomer. These results confirmed that the Abeta1-42 species present at this initial time was the monomer. Methylene blue, an anti-Alzheimer disease candidate, was then evaluated. In spite of an oligomerization inhibition, the enhanced disappearance of the Abeta1-42 monomer provoked by methylene blue was demonstrated for the first time. This method, allowing the monomeric and smallest oligomeric species to be monitored, represents a new accurate and precise way to evaluate compounds for drug discovery.

25222039|t|Synergistic effect of beta-amyloid and neurodegeneration on cognitive decline in clinically normal individuals.
25222039|a|IMPORTANCE: Assessing the ability of Alzheimer disease neuroimaging markers to predict short-term cognitive decline among clinically normal (CN) individuals is critical for upcoming secondary prevention trials using cognitive outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether neuroimaging markers of beta-amyloid (Abeta) and neurodegeneration (ND) are independently or synergistically associated with longitudinal cognitive decline in CN individuals. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Academic medical center longitudinal natural history study among 166 CN individuals (median age, 74 years; 92 women). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The Abeta status was determined with Pittsburgh Compound B-positron emission tomography, while ND was assessed using 2 a priori measures, hippocampus volume (magnetic resonance imaging) and glucose metabolism (positron emission tomography with fludeoxyglucose F 18), extracted from Alzheimer disease-vulnerable regions. Based on imaging markers, CN individuals were categorized into the following preclinical Alzheimer disease stages: stage 0 (Abeta-/ND-), stage 1 (Abeta(+)/ND-), stage 2 (Abeta(+)/ND(+)), and suspected non-Alzheimer disease pathology (Abeta-/ND(+)). Cognition was assessed with a composite of neuropsychological tests administered annually. RESULTS: The Abeta(+) CN individuals were more likely to be classified as ND+: 59.6% of Abeta(+) CN individuals were ND(+), whereas 31.9% of Abeta- CN individuals were ND(+) (odds ratio, 3.14; 95% CI, 1.44-7.02; P = .004). In assessing longitudinal cognitive performance, practice effects were evident in CN individuals negative for both Abeta and ND, whereas diminished practice effects were observed in CN individuals positive for either Abeta or ND. Decline over time was observed only in CN individuals positive for both Abeta and ND, and decline in this group was significantly greater than that in all other groups (P < .001 for all). A significant interaction term between Abeta and ND confirmed that this decline was greater than the additive contributions of Abeta and ND (P = .04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The co-occurrence of Abeta and ND accelerates cognitive decline in CN individuals. Therefore, both factors are important to consider in upcoming secondary prevention trials targeting CN individuals at high risk for progression to the symptomatic stages of Alzheimer disease.

25222068|t|Alzheimer disease in a mouse model: MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound targeted to the hippocampus opens the blood-brain barrier and improves pathologic abnormalities and behavior.
25222068|a|PURPOSE: To validate whether repeated magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-guided focused ultrasound treatments targeted to the hippocampus, a brain structure relevant for Alzheimer disease ( AD Alzheimer disease ), could modulate pathologic abnormalities, plasticity, and behavior in a mouse model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Care Committee and are in accordance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Seven-month-old transgenic (TgCRND8) (Tg) mice and their nontransgenic (non-Tg) littermates were entered in the study. Mice were treated weekly with MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound in the bilateral hippocampus (1.68 MHz, 10-msec bursts, 1-Hz burst repetition frequency, 120-second total duration). After 1 month, spatial memory was tested in the Y maze with the novel arm prior to sacrifice and immunohistochemical analysis. The data were compared by using unpaired t tests and analysis of variance with Tukey post hoc analysis. RESULTS: Untreated Tg mice spent 61% less time than untreated non-Tg mice exploring the novel arm of the Y maze because of spatial memory impairments (P < .05). Following MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound, Tg mice spent 99% more time exploring the novel arm, performing as well as their non-Tg littermates. Changes in behavior were correlated with a reduction of the number and size of amyloid plaques in the MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound-treated animals (P < .01). Further, after MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound treatment, there was a 250% increase in the number of newborn neurons in the hippocampus (P < .01). The newborn neurons had longer dendrites and more arborization after MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound, as well (P < .01). CONCLUSION: Repeated MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound treatments led to spatial memory improvement in a Tg mouse model of AD Alzheimer disease . The behavior changes may be mediated by decreased amyloid pathologic abnormalities and increased neuronal plasticity.

25226113|t|Amyloid imaging in Alzheimer's disease: a literature review.
25226113|a|Therapies targeting amyloid-beta peptide currently represent approximately 50% of drugs now being developed for Alzheimer's disease. Some, including active and passive anti-Abeta immunotherapy, directly target the amyloid plaques. The new amyloid tracers are increasingly being included in the proposed updated diagnostic criteria, and may allow earlier diagnosis. Those targeting amyloid-beta peptide allow identification of amyloid plaques in vivo. We need to gain insight into all aspects of their application. As florbetapir (Amyvid ) and flutemetamol (Vizamyl ) have received marketing authorization, clinicians require deeper knowledge to be rationally used in diagnosis. In this paper, we review both completed and ongoing observational, longitudinal and interventional studies of these tracers, our main objective being to show the performance of the four most commonly used tracers and their validation.

25227162|t|1,2-Diaryl-2-hydroxyiminoethanones as dual COX-1 and beta-amyloid aggregation inhibitors: biological evaluation and in silico study.
25227162|a|To find out new agents for treating inflammatory-involved diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, a series of 1,2-diaryl-2-hydroxyiminoethanones containing vicinal diaryl pharmacophore of COX inhibitors were tested by a set of in vitro, in vivo, and computational studies. The in vivo study of compounds indicated their prominent anti-inflammatory ability at the doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg comparable to celecoxib (10 mg/kg). Further in vitro COX-1/COX-2 evaluations revealed that 4-methoxy derivative 3 had a high selective COX-1 inhibitory activity (COX-1, IC50=0.12 mum, SI>833). To evaluate their potential use against Alzheimer's disease, in vitro evaluation of beta-amyloid fibril formation using Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) peptides was performed. The evaluation of their antiaggregation ability gave impressive results and comparable to rifampicin and indomethacin. Conformational study of compound 3 and subsequent docking of its restrained analogs on both active sites of COX-1 and COX-2 could provide a proof of its COX-1 selectivity as well as molecular dynamic simulation could elucidate and give more insight into the amyloid disaggregation mechanisms leading to rational design of inhibitors.

25227313|t|Spreading of amyloid, tau, and microvascular pathology in Alzheimer's disease: findings from neuropathological and neuroimaging studies.
25227313|a|Primary pathologies including amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) develop many years before the onset of dementia symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Age-related small vessel disease (SVD) is common in elderly subjects and may contribute to the clinical syndrome of AD. Each type of pathology shows a specific spatio-temporal sequence of spreading in the brain. Here, we review neuropathological and neuroimaging findings (PET tracers of Abeta and NFT, MRI markers of SVD) to assess whether staging of these primary pathologies is useful to predict clinical symptoms in AD. On the basis of neuropathological data, early stages of Abeta plaque and NFT pathology distribution occur in preclinical AD, but advanced stages with spreading into further brain regions are associated with dementia symptoms. Amyloid PET presumably detects Abeta in advanced neuropathological Abeta stages, and increased global amyloid PET uptake is associated with clinical worsening in non-demented subjects. Tau PET may provide additional predictive value by detecting NFT in the allocortex. There is weak evidence that SVD is related to amyloid or NFT pathology. Global volume of MRI-assessed white matter hyperintensities (WMH) contribute in addition to biomarker levels of Abeta to predict cognitive decline. Regional differences of the effect of WMH on cognition have been demonstrated but are not yet established as a biomarker in AD. In conclusion, biomarkers for amyloid and tau pathology allow a distinction between early and advanced stages of AD, but a subgroup of pathologically identified preclinical AD cases is not identified by the currently available biomarkers.

25227498|t|Proton radiation therapy for the treatment of retinoblastoma.
25227498|a|PURPOSE: To investigate long-term disease and toxicity outcomes for pediatric retinoblastoma patients treated with proton radiation therapy (PRT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: This is a retrospective analysis of 49 retinoblastoma patients (60 eyes) treated with PRT between 1986 and 2012. RESULTS: The majority (84%) of patients had bilateral disease, and nearly half (45%) had received prior chemotherapy. At a median follow-up of 8 years (range, 1-24 years), no patients died of retinoblastoma or developed metastatic disease. The post-PRT enucleation rate was low (18%), especially in patients with early-stage disease (11% for patients with International Classification for Intraocular Retinoblastoma [ICIR] stage A-B disease vs 23% for patients with ICIR stage C-D disease). Post-PRT ophthalmologic follow-up was available for 61% of the preserved eyes (30 of 49): 14 of 30 eyes (47%) had 20/40 visual acuity or better, 7 of 30 (23%) had moderate visual acuity (20/40-20/600), and 9 of 30 (30%) had little or no useful vision (worse than 20/600). Twelve of 60 treated eyes (20%) experienced a post-PRT event requiring intervention, with cataracts the most common (4 eyes). No patients developed an in-field second malignancy. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term follow-up of retinoblastoma patients treated with PRT demonstrates that PRT can achieve high local control rates, even in advanced cases, and many patients retain useful vision in the treated eye. Treatment-related ocular side effects were uncommon, and no radiation-associated malignancies were observed.

25227717|t|A (68)Ga complex based on benzofuran scaffold for the detection of beta-amyloid plaques.
25227717|a|Since the imaging of beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques in the brain is believed to be a useful tool for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a number of imaging probes to detect Abeta plaques have been developed. Because the radionuclide (68)Ga (t1/2=68 min) for PET imaging could become an attractive alternative to (11)C and (18)F, we designed and synthesized a benzofuran derivative conjugated with a (68)Ga complex ((68)Ga-DOTA-C3-BF) as a novel Abeta imaging probe. In an in vitro binding assay, Ga-DOTA-C3-BF showed high affinity for Abeta(1-42) aggregates (Ki=10.8 nM). The Ga-DOTA-C3-BF clearly stained Abeta plaques in a section of Tg2576 mouse, reflecting the affinity for Abeta(1-42) aggregates in vitro. In a biodistribution study in normal mice, (68)Ga-DOTA-C3-BF displayed low initial uptake (0.45% ID/g) in the brain at 2 min post-injection. While improvement of the brain uptake of (68)Ga complexes appears to be essential, these results suggest that novel PET imaging probes that include (68)Ga as the radionuclide for PET may be feasible.

25229015|t|Effects of Flavonoid Compounds on beta-amyloid-peptide-induced Neuronal Death in Cultured Mouse Cortical Neurons.
25229015|a|Excessive accumulation of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) is one of the major mechanisms responsible for neuronal death in Alzheimer's disease. Flavonoids, primarily antioxidants, are a group of polyphenolic compounds synthesized in plant cells. The present study aimed to identify flavonoid compounds that could inhibit Abeta-induced neuronal death by examining the effects of various flavonoids on the neurotoxicity of Abeta fragment 25-35 (Abeta25-35) in mouse cortical cultures. Abeta25-35 induced concentration- and exposure-time-dependent neuronal death. Neuronal death induced by 20 microM Abeta25-35 was significantly inhibited by treatment with either Trolox or ascorbic acid. Among 10 flavonoid compounds tested [apigenin, baicalein, catechin, epicatechin, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), kaempferol, luteolin, myricetin, quercetin, and rutin], all except apigenin showed strong 1,1-diphenyl-2-pycrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity under cell-free conditions. The flavonoid compounds except apigenin at a concentration of 30 microM also significantly inhibited neuronal death induced by 20 microM Abeta25-35 at the end of 24 hours of exposure. Epicatechin, EGCG, luteolin, and myricetin showed more potent and persistent neuroprotective action than did the other compounds. These results demonstrated that oxidative stress was involved in Abeta-induced neuronal death, and antioxidative flavonoid compounds, especially epicatechin, EGCG, luteolin, and myricetin, could inhibit neuronal death. These findings suggest that these four compounds may be developed as neuroprotective agents against Alzheimer's disease.

25229233|t|Surface effects mediate self-assembly of amyloid-beta peptides.
25229233|a|Here we present a label-free method for studying the mechanism of surface effects on amyloid aggregation. In this method, spin-coating is used to rapidly dry samples, in a homogeneous manner, after various incubation times. This technique allows the control of important parameters for self-assembly, such as the surface concentration. Atomic force microscopy is then used to obtain high-resolution images of the morphology. While imaging under dry conditions, we show that the morphologies of self-assembled aggregates of a model amyloid-beta peptide, Abeta(12-28), are strongly influenced by the local surface concentration. On mica surfaces, where the peptides can freely diffuse, homogeneous, self-assembled protofibrils formed spontaneously and grew longer with longer subsequent incubation. The surface fibrillization rate was much faster than the rates of fibril formation observed in solution, with initiation occurring at much lower concentrations. These data suggest an alternative pathway for amyloid formation on surfaces where the nucleation stage is either bypassed entirely or too fast to measure. This simple preparation procedure for high-resolution atomic force microscopy imaging of amyloid oligomers and protofibrils should be applicable to any amyloidogenic protein species.

25229860|t|Green tea aroma fraction reduces beta-amyloid peptide-induced toxicity in Caenorhabditis elegans transfected with human beta-amyloid minigene.
25229860|a|Green tea is a popular world-wide beverage with health benefits that include preventive effects on cancer as well as cardiovascular, liver and Alzheimer's diseases (AD). This study will examine the preventive effects on AD of a unique aroma of Japanese green tea. First, a transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) CL4176 expressing human beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) was used as a model of AD. A hexane extract of processed green tea was further fractionated into volatile and non-volatile fractions, named roasty aroma and green tea aroma fractions depending on their aroma, by microscale distillation. Both hexane extract and green tea aroma fraction were found to inhibit Abeta-induced paralysis, while only green tea aroma fraction extended lifespan in CL4176. We also found that green tea aroma fraction has antioxidant activity. This paper indicates that the green tea aroma fraction is an additional component for prevention of AD.

25230339|t|BACE1 RNA interference improves spatial memory and attenuates Abeta burden in a streptozotocin-induced tau hyperphosphorylated rat model.
25230339|a|Both senile plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles are important pathological characteristics in Alzheimer's disease. However, the relationship between Abeta deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation is unknown. In this study, the increased levels of full-length amyloid precursor protein (APP), APP C-terminal fragment (beta-CTF) and BACE1 were found in streptozotocin-induced tau hyperphosphorylation models by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry methods. In the previous studies, few strategies focusing on inhibiting beta-secretase (BACE1) in a tau hyperphosphorylation model were utilized. Here, BACE1 RNAi was used to treat the streptozotocin-induced tau hyperphosphorylation animal models. BACE1 RNAi treatment improved the behavioural ability of animal models and reduced the amount of Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42, accompanied by decreasing the levels of BACE1 and beta-CTF. Our results demonstrated that neurological defects and neurotoxic fragments, including Abeta and beta-CTF, were eliminated by BACE1 RNAi in the tau hyperphosphorylated model, implying the efficiency and safety of BACE1RNAi treatment against Alzheimer's disease.

25231463|t|The relationship between dry eye and migraine.
25231463|a|Presently, migraine and dry eye are both thought to have an inflammatory pathogenesis. We aimed to investigate dry eye findings and any relationship with headache characteristics in migraine patients with and without aura. In total, 58 migraineurs and 41 age- and gender-matched controls were enrolled in this prospective clinical study. The migraine diagnosis was made according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders II diagnostic criteria. All patients underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination including tear meniscus measurements, meibography, tear breakup time, Schirmer test and the Ocular Surface Disease Index questionnaire. The presence of dry eye was higher in migraineurs as compared to the control group, but this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.282). Among the headache characteristics, the presence of aura was significantly higher, and disease and attack durations were significantly longer in migraineurs with dry eye than in those without dry eye (p = 0.009, p = 0.010, and p = 0.003, respectively). In multiple logistic regression model, attack duration was found to be independently associated with the presence of dry eye in migraine patients (OR; 95 % CI; p = 0.029). The results show that dry eye may present in migraine patients with greater presence of auras and longer disease and attack durations.

25232124|t|Intracellular accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein plays a major role in Abeta-induced alterations of glutamatergic synaptic transmission and plasticity.
25232124|a|Intracellular accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein has been proposed as an early event in AD pathogenesis. In patients with mild cognitive impairment, intraneuronal Abeta immunoreactivity was found especially in brain regions critically involved in the cognitive deficits of AD. Although a large body of evidence demonstrates that Abeta42 accumulates intraneuronally ((in)Abeta), the action and the role of Abeta42 buildup on synaptic function have been poorly investigated. Here, we demonstrate that basal synaptic transmission and LTP were markedly depressed following Abeta42 injection into the neuron through the patch pipette. Control experiments performed with the reverse peptide (Abeta42-1) allowed us to exclude that the effects of (in)Abeta depended on changes in oncotic pressure. To further investigate (in)Abeta synaptotoxicity we used an Abeta variant harboring oxidized methionine in position 35 that does not cross the neuronal plasma membrane and is not uploaded from the extracellular space. This Abeta42 variant had no effects on synaptic transmission and plasticity when applied extracellularly, but induced synaptic depression and LTP inhibition after patch-pipette dialysis. Finally, the injection of an antibody raised against human Abeta42 (6E10) in CA1 pyramidal neurons of mouse hippocampal brain slices and autaptic microcultures did not, per se, significantly affect LTP and basal synaptic transmission, but it protected against the toxic effects of extracellular Abeta42. Collectively, these findings suggest that Abeta42-induced impairment of glutamatergic synaptic function depends on its internalization and intracellular accumulation thus paving the way to a systemic proteomic analysis of intracellular targets/partners of Abeta42.

25236641|t|Establishing cause of maternal death in Malawi via facility-based review and application of the ICD-MM classification.
25236641|a|Maternal death review (MDR) is an accepted process that is implemented across Malawi and 'underlying cause of death' is assigned by healthcare providers using a standard MDR form. Mixed-methods approach. Key informant interviews with eight stakeholders involved in MDR. Secondary analysis of MDR forms for 54 maternal deaths. Comparison of assigned cause of death by healthcare providers conducting MDR at health facility level with cause assigned by researchers using the International Classification of Diseases Maternal Mortality (ICD-MM) classification. MDR teams, analysts and policymakers reported facing challenges in completing the forms, analysing and using information. The concepts of underlying (primary) and contributing (secondary) causes of death are often misunderstood. Healthcare providers using only MDR forms reported cause of death as non-obstetric complications in 39.6% and pregnancy-related infection in 11.3% of cases. For 30.2% of cases, no clear clinical cause of death was recorded. The most commonly assigned underlying cause of death using ICD-MM was obstetric haemorrhage (32.1%), non-obstetric complications (24.5%) and pregnancy-related infection (22.6%). There was poor agreement between cause(s) of maternal death assigned by healthcare providers in the field and trained researchers using the new ICD-MM classification (kappa statistic; 0.219). The majority of cases could be reclassified using the ICD-MM and this provided a more specific cause of death. A more structured and user-friendly MDR form is required. Accurate classification of cause of death is important. Dissemination of, and training in the use of the new ICD-MM classification system will be helpful to healthcare providers conducting MDR in Malawi.

25237806|t|Cisplatin inhibits the formation of a reactive intermediate during copper-catalyzed oxidation of amyloid beta peptide.
25237806|a|Cisplatin was studied for its effect on the copper-catalyzed oxidation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide. The interaction of cisplatin with Abeta1-16 in the presence of Cu(II) was investigated using cyclic voltammetry and mass spectrometry. The positive shift in the E1/2 value of Abeta1-16-Cu(II) suggests that the interaction of cisplatin alters the copper-binding properties of Abeta1-16. The mass spectrometry data show complete inhibition of copper-catalyzed decarboxylation/deamination of the Asp1 residue of Abeta1-16, while there is a significant decrease in copper-catalyzed oxidation of Abeta1-16 in the presence of cisplatin. Overall, our results provide a novel mode by which cisplatin inhibits copper-catalyzed oxidation of Abeta. These findings may lead to the design of better platinum complexes to treat oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease and other related neurological disorders.

25238173|t|Structure-activity relationships of sugar-based peptidomimetics as modulators of amyloid beta-peptide early oligomerization and fibrillization.
25238173|a|Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder linked to oligomerization and fibrillization of amyloid beta peptides. Abeta1-42 being the most aggregative and neurotoxic amyloid peptide, we report herein the capacity of sugar-based pentapeptide analogs to modulate the Abeta1-42 aggregation process using thioflavin fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy assays. The importance of the free hydroxyl groups of the sugar moiety, used as a beta-breaker element, is confirmed since hydroxylated compounds inhibit the aggregation process while benzylated ones enhance it. Furthermore, the most effective molecules were also evaluated by a recently developed capillary electrophoresis method, providing in vitro monitoring of the crucial, very early stages of the self-assembly process. This technique allowed us to investigate the effect of these compounds on the small non-fibrillar Abeta1-42 oligomers suspected by several groups worldwide as highly neurotoxic. We clearly demonstrated that molecules delaying the aggregation can stabilize the monomeric peptide or promote the formation of soluble oligomeric species. In contrast, molecules that accelerate the aggregation can prevent the presence of small toxic oligomers.

25239520|t|Prominence of central sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1 in attenuating abeta-induced injury by fingolimod.
25239520|a|FTY720 (fingolimod), the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) analogue, has been experimentally indicated to exert substantial ameliorating effects in animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present work aims to answer whether central S1P receptor 1 (S1P1) plays significant role in the impact of fingolimod in AD. To verify the prominence of central FTY720 phosphorylation, DMS (sphingosine kinase inhibitor) was infused intracerebrally in parallel with systemic FTY720 administration to prevent central formation of FTY720-P as the recognized active ligand for S1PRs. The corresponding S1P1 modulation was also investigated using the pharmacological blockage of central S1P1 by W123. Both DMS and W123 were efficiently capable of suppressing FTY720-ameliorating effects in AD animals, either on memory deficit or on COX-II and TNF-alpha expression. Our data conclude that experimental benefits of FTY720 in the context of AD depend on central S1P1 modulation, as well as on S1P kinase activity in the brain.

25239621|t|Alzheimer presenilin-1 mutations dramatically reduce trimming of long amyloid beta-peptides (Abeta) by gamma-secretase to increase 42-to-40-residue Abeta.
25239621|a|The presenilin-containing gamma-secretase complex produces the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) through intramembrane proteolysis, and >100 presenilin mutations are associated with familial early-onset Alzheimer disease (AD). The question of whether these mutations result in AD through a gain or a loss of function remains highly controversial. Mutations in presenilins increase ratios of 42- to 40-residue Abeta critical to pathogenesis, but other Abetas of 38-49 residues are also formed by gamma-secretase. Evidence in cells suggests the protease first cleaves substrate within the transmembrane domain at the epsilon site to form 48- or 49-residue Abeta. Subsequent cleavage almost every three residues from the C terminus is thought to occur along two pathways toward shorter secreted forms of Abeta: Abeta49   Abeta46   Abeta43   Abeta40 and Abeta48   Abeta45   Abeta42   Abeta38. Here we show that the addition of synthetic long Abeta peptides (Abeta45-49) directly into purified preparations of gamma-secretase leads to the formation of Abeta40 and Abeta42 whether the protease complex is detergent-solubilized or reconstituted into lipid vesicles, and the ratios of products Abeta42 to Abeta40 follow a pattern consistent with the dual-pathway hypothesis. Kinetic analysis of five different AD-causing mutations in presenilin-1 revealed that all result in drastic reduction of normal carboxypeptidase function. Altered trimming of long Abeta peptides to Abeta40 and Abeta42 by mutant proteases occurs at multiple levels, independent of the effects on initial endoproteolysis at the epsilon site, all conspiring to increase the critical Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio implicated in AD pathogenesis. Taken together, these results suggest that specific reduction of carboxypeptidase function of gamma-secretase leads to the gain of toxic Abeta42/Abeta40.

25242217|t|Deficiency in LRP6-mediated Wnt signaling contributes to synaptic abnormalities and amyloid pathology in Alzheimer's disease.
25242217|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurological disorder characterized by synaptic loss and dementia. The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) is an essential coreceptor for Wnt signaling, and its genetic variants have been linked to AD risk. Here we report that neuronal LRP6-mediated Wnt signaling is critical for synaptic function and cognition. Conditional deletion of Lrp6 gene in mouse forebrain neurons leads to age-dependent deficits in synaptic integrity and memory. Neuronal LRP6 deficiency in an amyloid mouse model also leads to exacerbated amyloid pathology due to increased APP processing to amyloid-beta. In humans, LRP6 and Wnt signaling are significantly downregulated in AD brains, likely by a mechanism that depends on amyloid-beta. Our results define a critical pathway in which decreased LRP6-mediated Wnt signaling, synaptic dysfunction, and elevated Abeta synergistically accelerate AD progression and suggest that restoring LRP6-mediated Wnt signaling can be explored as a viable strategy for AD therapy.

25245405|t|Modeling cognitive reserve in healthy middle-aged and older adults: the Tasmanian Healthy Brain Project.
25245405|a|BACKGROUND: Cognitive reserve (CR) is a protective factor that supports cognition by increasing the resilience of an individual's cognitive function to the deleterious effects of cerebral lesions. A single environmental proxy indicator is often used to estimate CR (e.g. education), possibly resulting in a loss of the accuracy and predictive power of the investigation. Furthermore, while estimates of an individual's prior CR can be made, no operational measure exists to estimate dynamic change in CR resulting from exposure to new life experiences. METHODS: We aimed to develop two latent measures of CR through factor analysis: prior and current, in a sample of 467 healthy older adults. RESULTS: The prior CR measure combined proxy measures traditionally associated with CR, while the current CR measure combined variables that had the potential to reflect dynamic change in CR due to new life experiences. Our main finding was that the analyses uncovered latent variables in hypothesized prior and current models of CR. CONCLUSIONS: The prior CR model supports multivariate estimation of pre-existing CR and may be applied to more accurately estimate CR in the absence of neuropathological data. The current CR model may be applied to evaluate and explore the potential benefits of CR-based interventions prior to dementia onset.

25248508|t|A platelet protein biochip rapidly detects an Alzheimer's disease-specific phenotype.
25248508|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), a multifactorial neurodegenerative condition caused by genetic and environmental factors, is diagnosed using neuropsychological tests and brain imaging; molecular diagnostics are not routinely applied. Studies have identified AD-specific cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers but sample collection requires invasive lumbar puncture. To identify AD-modulated proteins in easily accessible blood platelets, which share biochemical signatures with neurons, we compared platelet lysates from 62 AD, 24 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), 13 vascular dementia (VaD), and 12 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with those of 112 matched controls by fluorescence two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis in independent discovery and verification sets. The optimal sum score of four mass spectrometry (MS)-identified proteins yielded a sensitivity of 94 % and a specificity of 89 % (AUC = 0.969, 95 % CI = 0.944-0.994) to differentiate AD patients from healthy controls. To bridge the gap between bench and bedside, we developed a high-throughput multiplex protein biochip with great potential for routine AD screening. For convenience and speed of application, this array combines loading control-assisted protein quantification of monoamine oxidase B and tropomyosin 1 with protein-based genotyping for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the apolipoprotein E and glutathione S-transferase omega 1 genes. Based on minimally invasive blood drawing, this innovative protein biochip enables identification of AD patients with an accuracy of 92 % in a single analytical step in less than 4 h.

25248842|t|Kinetics of serotonin oxidation by heme-Abeta relevant to Alzheimer's disease.
25248842|a|Serotonin (5-HT) is an essential neurotransmitter for cognitive functions and formation of new memories. A deficit in 5-HT dependent neuronal activity is somewhat specific for Alzheimer's disease. Metal-mediated oxidative degradation of neurotransmitters by Abeta bound to metals has been investigated. Heme-bound Abeta is found to catalyze the oxidative degradation of 5-HT leading to the formation of neurotoxic products dihydroxybitryptamine and tyrptamine-4,5-dione. The catalytic degradation of 5-HT is of first order with respect to both heme-Abeta and H2O2, and the maximum rate of 5-HT oxidation is obtained at physiological pH (pH 7-7.5). pH perturbation of the binding affinity of heme-Abeta complex for 5-HT indicates that the binding of the substrate (5-HT) is not the rate-determining step. Arg5 acts as a second-sphere residue facilitating the O-O bond cleavage, the mutation of which leads to a decrease in the rate of 5-HT oxidation. The pull effect of the Arg5 residue tends to facilitate the generation of the active oxidant, Compound I, below neutral pH, while the ionization of the phenol group of the substrate facilitates the generation of the active substrate above neutral pH. A combination of these two opposing effects results in the highest activity at physiological pH. Apart from the Arg5 residue, the Tyr10 residue is found to play a vital role in the 5-HT oxidation by heme-Abeta complexes.

25249289|t|Multiple mechanisms of iron-induced amyloid beta-peptide accumulation in SHSY5Y cells: protective action of negletein.
25249289|a|The increased accumulation of iron in the brain in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is well documented, and excess iron is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease. The adverse effects of accumulated iron in AD brain may include the oxidative stress, altered amyloid beta-metabolism and the augmented toxicity of metal-bound amyloid beta 42. In this study, we have shown that exogenously added iron in the form of ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) leads to considerable accumulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) without a corresponding change in the concerned gene expression in cultured SHSY5Y cells during exposure up to 48 h. This phenomenon is also associated with increased beta-secretase activity and augmented release of amyloid beta 42 in the medium. Further, the increase in beta-secretase activity, in SHSY5Y cells, upon exposure to iron apparently involves reactive oxygen species (ROS) and NF-kappaB activation. The synthetic flavone negletein (5,6-dihydroxy-7-methoxyflavone), which is a known chelator for iron, can significantly prevent the effects of FAC on APP metabolism in SHSY5Y cells. Further, this compound inhibits the iron-dependent formation of ROS and also blocks the iron-induced oligomerization of amyloid beta 42 in vitro. In concentrations used in this study, negletein alone appears to have only marginal toxic effects on cell viability, but, on the other hand, the drug is capable of ameliorating the iron-induced loss of cell viability considerably. Our results provide the initial evidence of potential therapeutic effects of negletein, which should be explored in suitable animal models of AD.

25253695|t|The Alzheimer disease protective mutation A2T modulates kinetic and thermodynamic properties of amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregation.
25253695|a|Missense mutations in alanine 673 of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which corresponds to the second alanine of the amyloid beta (Abeta) sequence, have dramatic impact on the risk for Alzheimer disease; A2V is causative, and A2T is protective. Assuming a crucial role of amyloid-Abeta in neurodegeneration, we hypothesized that both A2V and A2T mutations cause distinct changes in Abeta properties that may at least partially explain these completely different phenotypes. Using human APP-overexpressing primary neurons, we observed significantly decreased Abeta production in the A2T mutant along with an enhanced Abeta generation in the A2V mutant confirming earlier data from non-neuronal cell lines. More importantly, thioflavin T fluorescence assays revealed that the mutations, while having little effect on Abeta42 peptide aggregation, dramatically change the properties of the Abeta40 pool with A2V accelerating and A2T delaying aggregation of the Abeta peptides. In line with the kinetic data, Abeta A2T demonstrated an increase in the solubility at equilibrium, an effect that was also observed in all mixtures of the A2T mutant with the wild type Abeta40. We propose that in addition to the reduced beta-secretase cleavage of APP, the impaired propensity to aggregate may be part of the protective effect conferred by A2T substitution. The interpretation of the protective effect of this mutation is thus much more complicated than proposed previously.

25253696|t|Molecular mechanisms of Alzheimer disease protection by the A673T allele of amyloid precursor protein.
25253696|a|Pathogenic mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene have been described as causing early onset familial Alzheimer disease (AD). We recently identified a rare APP variant encoding an alanine-to-threonine substitution at residue 673 (A673T) that confers protection against development of AD (Jonsson, T., Atwal, J. K., Steinberg, S., Snaedal, J., Jonsson, P. V., Bjornsson, S., Stefansson, H., Sulem, P., Gudbjartsson, D., Maloney, J., Hoyte, K., Gustafson, A., Liu, Y., Lu, Y., Bhangale, T., Graham, R. R., Huttenlocher, J., Bjornsdottir, G., Andreassen, O. A., Jonsson, E. G., Palotie, A., Behrens, T. W., Magnusson, O. T., Kong, A., Thorsteinsdottir, U., Watts, R. J., and Stefansson, K. (2012) Nature 488, 96-99). The Ala-673 residue lies within the beta-secretase recognition sequence and is part of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide cleavage product (position 2 of Abeta). We previously demonstrated that the A673T substitution makes APP a less favorable substrate for cleavage by BACE1. In follow-up studies, we confirm that A673T APP shows reduced cleavage by BACE1 in transfected mouse primary neurons and in isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons. Using a biochemical approach, we show that the A673T substitution modulates the catalytic turnover rate (V(max)) of APP by the BACE1 enzyme, without affecting the affinity (K(m)) of the APP substrate for BACE1. We also show a reduced level of Abeta(1-42) aggregation with A2T Abeta peptides, an observation not conserved in Abeta(1-40) peptides. When combined in a ratio of 1:9 Abeta(1-42)/Abeta(1-40) to mimic physiologically relevant mixtures, A2T retains a trend toward slowed aggregation kinetics. Microglial uptake of the mutant Abeta(1-42) peptides correlated with their aggregation level. Cytotoxicity of the mutant Abeta peptides was not dramatically altered. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that A673T, a protective allele of APP, reproducibly reduces amyloidogenic processing of APP and also mildly decreases Abeta aggregation. These effects could together have an additive or even synergistic impact on the risk of developing AD.

25253756|t|Self-reported memory complaints: implications from a longitudinal cohort with autopsies.
25253756|a|OBJECTIVE: We assessed salience of subjective memory complaints (SMCs) by older individuals as a predictor of subsequent cognitive impairment while accounting for risk factors and eventual neuropathologies. METHODS: Subjects (n = 531) enrolled while cognitively intact at the University of Kentucky were asked annually if they perceived changes in memory since their last visit. A multistate model estimated when transition to impairment occurred while adjusting for intervening death. Risk factors affecting the timing and probability of an impairment were identified. The association between SMCs and Alzheimer-type neuropathology was assessed from autopsies (n = 243). RESULTS: SMCs were reported by more than half (55.7%) of the cohort, and were associated with increased risk of impairment (unadjusted odds ratio = 2.8, p < 0.0001). Mild cognitive impairment (dementia) occurred 9.2 (12.1) years after SMC. Multistate modeling showed that SMC reporters with an APOE epsilon4 allele had double the odds of impairment (adjusted odds ratio = 2.2, p = 0.036). SMC smokers took less time to transition to mild cognitive impairment, while SMC hormone-replaced women took longer to transition directly to dementia. Among participants (n = 176) who died without a diagnosed clinical impairment, SMCs were associated with elevated neuritic amyloid plaques in the neocortex and medial temporal lobe. CONCLUSION: SMC reporters are at a higher risk of future cognitive impairment and have higher levels of Alzheimer-type brain pathology even when impairment does not occur. As potential harbingers of future cognitive decline, physicians should query and monitor SMCs from their older patients.

25255476|t|Besides fibrillization: putative role of the peptide fragment 71-82 on the structural and assembly behavior of alpha-synuclein.
25255476|a|The fibrillization of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) is involved in Parkinson's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder that affects four million people in the world. The amino acid sequence 71-82 of this protein (VTGVTAVAQKTV) has appeared to be essential for fibril formation. In the present study, we have investigated the secondary structure and thermal stability of the peptide fragment 71-82, alpha-syn71-82, as a function of concentration and temperature, as well as its interactions with phospholipid model membranes using various spectroscopic techniques. The data show that alpha-syn71-82 is mainly disordered in solution with the presence of a few beta-sheet structure elements. The peptide reversibly forms intermolecular beta-sheets with increasing concentration and decreasing temperature, suggesting that it is subjected to a thermodynamic equilibrium between a monomeric and an oligomeric form. This equilibrium seems to be affected by the presence of zwitterionic membranes. Conversely, the influence of the peptide on zwitterionic lipid bilayers is small and concentration-dependent. By contrast, alpha-syn71-82 is strongly affected by anionic vesicles. The peptide indeed exhibits a dramatic conformational change, reflecting an extensive and irreversible self-aggregation, the majority of the amino acids being involved in a parallel beta-sheet conformation. The aggregates appear to be located near the membrane surface but do not perturb significantly the membrane order. Comparing these results with the literature, it appears that alpha-syn71-82 shares several general properties and structural similarities with its parent protein. These common points suggest that the sequence 71-82 may overall contribute to the behavior and properties of alpha-syn.

25256598|t|A hexameric peptide barrel as building block of amyloid-beta protofibrils.
25256598|a|Oligomeric and protofibrillar aggregates formed by the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) are believed to be involved in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Central to Alzheimer pathology is also the fact that the longer Abeta42 peptide is more prone to aggregation than the more prevalent Abeta40 . Detailed structural studies of Abeta oligomers and protofibrils have been impeded by aggregate heterogeneity and instability. We previously engineered a variant of Abeta that forms stable protofibrils and here we use solid-state NMR spectroscopy and molecular modeling to derive a structural model of these. NMR data are consistent with packing of residues 16 to 42 of Abeta protomers into hexameric barrel-like oligomers within the protofibril. The core of the oligomers consists of all residues of the central and C-terminal hydrophobic regions of Abeta, and hairpin loops extend from the core. The model accounts for why Abeta42 forms oligomers and protofibrils more easily than Abeta40 .

25256713|t|Phenotyping structural abnormalities in mouse embryos using high-resolution episcopic microscopy.
25256713|a|The arrival of simple and reliable methods for 3D imaging of mouse embryos has opened the possibility of analysing normal and abnormal development in a far more systematic and comprehensive manner than has hitherto been possible. This will not only help to extend our understanding of normal tissue and organ development but, by applying the same approach to embryos from genetically modified mouse lines, such imaging studies could also transform our knowledge of gene function in embryogenesis and the aetiology of developmental disorders. The International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium is coordinating efforts to phenotype single gene knockouts covering the entire mouse genome, including characterising developmental defects for those knockout lines that prove to be embryonic lethal. Here, we present a pilot study of 34 such lines, utilising high-resolution episcopic microscopy (HREM) for comprehensive 2D and 3D imaging of homozygous null embryos and their wild-type littermates. We present a simple phenotyping protocol that has been developed to take advantage of the high-resolution images obtained by HREM and that can be used to score tissue and organ abnormalities in a reliable manner. Using this approach with embryos at embryonic day 14.5, we show the wide range of structural abnormalities that are likely to be detected in such studies and the variability in phenotypes between sibling homozygous null embryos.

DESIGN: An international collaboration involving 34 clinical/academic centers and three industry collaborators from 16 countries on five continents. SETTING: In 2013, two workshops were conducted followed by global consultation, bringing together 54 leaders in endometriosis research and sample processing from around the world. PATIENT(S): None. INTERVENTION(S): Consensus SOPs were based on: 1) systematic comparison of SOPs from 24 global centers collecting tissue samples from women with and without endometriosis on a medium or large scale (publication on >100 cases); 2) literature evidence where available, or consultation with laboratory experts otherwise; and 3) several global consultation rounds. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Standard recommended and minimum required SOPs for tissue collection, processing, and storage in endometriosis research. RESULT(S): We developed "recommended standard" and "minimum required" SOPs for the collection, processing, and storage of ectopic and eutopic endometrium, peritoneum, and myometrium, and a biospecimen data collection form necessary for interpretation of sample-derived results. CONCLUSION(S): The EPHect SOPs allow endometriosis research centers to decrease variability in tissue-based results, facilitating between-center comparisons and collaborations. The procedures are also relevant to research into other gynecologic conditions involving endometrium, myometrium, and peritoneum. The consensus SOPs are based on the best available evidence; areas with limited evidence are identified as requiring further pilot studies.

25257985|t|Comparison of MR-less PiB SUVR quantification methods.
25257985|a|(11)C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) is a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer designed to bind to amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques, one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The potential of PiB as an early marker of AD led to the increasing use of PiB in clinical research studies and development of several F-18-labeled Abeta radiotracers. Automatic quantification of PiB images requires an accurate parcellation of the brain's gray matter (GM). Typically, this relies on a coregistered magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to extract the cerebellar GM, compute the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), and provide parcellation and segmentation for quantification of regional and global SUVR. However, not all subjects can undergo MRI, in which case, an MR-less method is desirable. In this study, we assess 3 PET-only quantification methods: a mean atlas, an adaptive atlas, and a multi-atlas approaches on a database of 237 subjects having been imaged with both PiB PET and MRI. The PET-only methods were compared against MR-based SUVR quantification and evaluated in terms of correlation, average error, and performance in classifying subjects with low and high Abeta deposition. The mean atlas method suffered from a significant bias between the estimated neocortical SUVR and the PiB status, resulting in an overall error of 5.6% (R(2) = 0.98), compared with the adaptive and multi-atlas approaches that had errors of 3.06% and 2.74%, respectively (R(2) = 0.98), and no significant bias. In classifying PiB-negative from PiB-positive subjects, the mean atlas had 10 misclassified subjects compared with 0 for the adaptive and 1 for the multi-atlas approach. Overall, the adaptive and the multi-atlas approaches performed similarly well against the MR-based quantification and would be a suitable replacements for PiB quantification when no MRI is available.

25259726|t|Multitarget drug design strategy: quinone-tacrine hybrids designed to block amyloid-beta aggregation and to exert anticholinesterase and antioxidant effects.
25259726|a|We report the identification of multitarget anti-Alzheimer compounds designed by combining a naphthoquinone function and a tacrine fragment. In vitro, 15 compounds displayed excellent acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory potencies and interesting capabilities to block amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregation. The X-ray analysis of one of those compounds in complex with AChE allowed rationalizing the outstanding activity data (IC50 = 0.72 nM). Two of the compounds showed negligible toxicity in immortalized mouse cortical neurons Neuro2A and primary rat cerebellar granule neurons. However, only one of them was less hepatotoxic than tacrine in HepG2 cells. In T67 cells, both compounds showed antioxidant activity, following NQO1 induction. Furthermore, in Neuro2A, they were able to completely revert the decrease in viability induced by Abeta. Importantly, they crossed the blood-brain barrier, as demonstrated in ex vivo experiments with rats. When ex vivo results were combined with in vitro studies, these two compounds emerged to be promising multitarget lead candidates worthy of further pursuit.

25261792|t|Mitochondrial dysfunction induced by a post-translationally modified amyloid linked to a familial mutation in an alternative model of neurodegeneration.
25261792|a|Familial British dementia (FBD) is an early-onset non-amyloid-beta (Abeta) cerebral amyloidosis that presents with severe cognitive decline and strikingly similar neuropathological features to those present in Alzheimer's disease (AD). FBD is associated with a T to A single nucleotide transition in the stop codon of a gene encoding BRI2, leading to the production of an elongated precursor protein. Furin-like proteolytic processing at its C-terminus releases a longer-than-normal 34 amino acid peptide, ABri, exhibiting amyloidogenic properties not seen in its 23 amino acid physiologic counterpart Bri1-23. Deposited ABri exhibits abundant post-translational pyroglutamate (pE) formation at the N-terminus, a feature seen in truncated forms of Abeta found in AD deposits, and co-exists with neurofibrillary tangles almost identical to those found in AD. We tested the impact of the FBD mutation alone and in conjunction with the pE post-translational modification on the structural properties and associated neurotoxicity of the ABri peptide. The presence of pE conferred to the ABri molecule enhanced hydrophobicity and accelerated aggregation/fibrillization properties. ABri pE was capable of triggering oxidative stress, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspase-mediated apoptotic mechanisms in neuronal cells, whereas homologous peptides lacking the elongated C-terminus and/or the N-terminal pE were unable to induce similar detrimental cellular pathways. The data indicate that the presence of N-terminal pE is not in itself sufficient to induce pathogenic changes in the physiologic Bri1-23 peptides but that its combination with the ABri mutation is critical for the molecular pathogenesis of FBD.

25261932|t|Genome-wide association study identifies multiple susceptibility loci for diffuse large B cell lymphoma.
25261932|a|Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common lymphoma subtype and is clinically aggressive. To identify genetic susceptibility loci for DLBCL, we conducted a meta-analysis of 3 new genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and 1 previous scan, totaling 3,857 cases and 7,666 controls of European ancestry, with additional genotyping of 9 promising SNPs in 1,359 cases and 4,557 controls. In our multi-stage analysis, five independent SNPs in four loci achieved genome-wide significance marked by rs116446171 at 6p25.3 (EXOC2; P = 2.33 x 10(-21)), rs2523607 at 6p21.33 (HLA-B; P = 2.40 x 10(-10)), rs79480871 at 2p23.3 (NCOA1; P = 4.23 x 10(-8)) and two independent SNPs, rs13255292 and rs4733601, at 8q24.21 (PVT1; P = 9.98 x 10(-13) and 3.63 x 10(-11), respectively). These data provide substantial new evidence for genetic susceptibility to this B cell malignancy and point to pathways involved in immune recognition and immune function in the pathogenesis of DLBCL.

25261995|t|Progranulin protects against amyloid beta deposition and toxicity in Alzheimer's disease mouse models.
25261995|a|Haploinsufficiency of the progranulin (PGRN) gene (GRN) causes familial frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and modulates an innate immune response in humans and in mouse models. GRN polymorphism may be linked to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the role of PGRN in AD pathogenesis is unknown. Here we show that PGRN inhibits amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition. Selectively reducing microglial expression of PGRN in AD mouse models impaired phagocytosis, increased plaque load threefold and exacerbated cognitive deficits. Lentivirus-mediated PGRN overexpression lowered plaque load in AD mice with aggressive amyloid plaque pathology. Abeta plaque load correlated negatively with levels of hippocampal PGRN, showing the dose-dependent inhibitory effects of PGRN on plaque deposition. PGRN also protected against Abeta toxicity. Lentivirus-mediated PGRN overexpression prevented spatial memory deficits and hippocampal neuronal loss in AD mice. The protective effects of PGRN against Abeta deposition and toxicity have important therapeutic implications. We propose enhancing PGRN as a potential treatment for PGRN-deficient FTLD and AD.

25262246|t|Cannabinoid receptor CB1 is involved in nicotine-induced protection against Abeta1-42 neurotoxicity in HT22 cells.
25262246|a|Emerging evidences suggest that nicotine exerts a neuroprotective effect on Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet the precise mechanism is not fully elucidated. Here, HT22 cells were exposed to amyloid beta protein fragment (Abeta)1-42 to mimic the pathological process of neuron in AD. We hypothesized that cannabinoid receptor CB1 is involved in the nicotine-induced neuroprotection against Abeta1-42 injury in HT22 cells. CB1 expression in HT22 cells was investigated by immunocytochemistry and Western blot. The injury of HT22 cells was evaluated by cellular morphology, cell viability, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. The apoptosis of HT22 cells was assessed by flow cytometry and expressions of Bcl-2 and Bax. The results demonstrated that nicotine markedly upregulated CB1 expression, increased cell viability, ameliorated cellular morphology, decreased LDH release, and reduced the apoptotic rate of HT22 cells exposed to Abeta1-42 for 24 h, while the blockade of CB1 or the inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) partially reversed the neuroprotection. Furthermore, the blockade of CB1 reversed nicotine-induced PKC activation in HT22 cells exposed to Abeta1-42. These results suggest that CB1 is involved in the nicotine-induced neuroprotection against Abeta1-42 neurotoxicity, and the neuroprotection may be dependent on the activation of PKC.

25262575|t|Bacterial enzymes effectively digest Alzheimer's beta-amyloid peptide.
25262575|a|Aggregated beta-amyloid peptides play key roles in the development of Alzheimer's disease, and recent evidence suggests that microbial particles, among others, can facilitate their polymerization. Bacterial enzymes, however, have been proved to be beneficial in degrading pathological fibrillar structures in clinical settings, such as strepto-kinases in resolving blood-clots. The purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of bacterial substances to effectively hydrolyze beta-amyloid peptides. Degrading products of several proteinases from Bacillus pumilus were evaluated using MALDI-TOF mass-spectrometry, and their toxicity was assessed in vitro using cell-culture assays and morphological studies. These enzymes have proved to be non-toxic and were demonstrated to cleave through the functional domains of beta-amyloid peptide. By yielding inactive fragments, proteinases of Bacillus pumilus may be used as candidate anti-amyloid agents.

25262917|t|A cyclic KLVFF-derived peptide aggregation inhibitor induces the formation of less-toxic off-pathway amyloid-beta oligomers.
25262917|a|Inhibition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregation could be a target of drug development for the treatment of currently incurable Alzheimer's disease. We previously reported that a head-to-tail cyclic peptide of KLVFF (cyclic-KLVFF), a pentapeptide fragment corresponding to the Abeta16-20 region (which plays a critical role in the generating Abeta fibrils), possesses potent inhibitory activity against Abeta aggregation. Here we found that the inhibitory activity of cyclic-KLVFF was significantly improved by incorporating an additional phenyl group at the beta-position of the Phe4 side chain (inhibitor 3). Biophysical and biochemical analyses revealed the rapid formation of 3-embedded oligomer species when Abeta1-42 was mixed with 3. The oligomer species is an "off-pathway" species with low affinity for cross-beta-sheet-specific dye thioflavin T and oligomer-specific A11 antibodies. The oligomer species had a sub-nanometer height and little capability of aggregation to amyloid fibrils. Importantly, the toxicity of the oligomer species was significantly lower than that of native Abeta oligomers. These insights will be useful for further refinement of cyclic-KLVFF-based aggregation inhibitors.

25263078|t|Bone marrow biopsy in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: useful or redundant test?
25263078|a|PURPOSE: To determine the additional value of bone marrow biopsy (BMB) in the standard staging work-up of patients with newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), in terms of risk assessment and treatment planning. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 113 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL who had undergone standard pretreatment evaluation, including serum lactate dehydrogenase measurement, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status assessment, computed tomography or (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography, and BMB, were retrospectively included. National Comprehensive Cancer Network International Prognostic Index (NCCN-IPI) score and treatment strategy were determined in each patient, once without and once with taking into account BMB results. Numbers and percentages of BMB-induced changes on NCCN-IPI-based risk stratification (i.e. formation of low, low-intermediate, high-intermediate, and high risk groups) and choice of treatment were calculated, along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: BMB was positive in 18 of 113 patients (15.9%, 95% CI 10.2-23.9 %). BMB-induced changes on NCCI-IPI-based risk stratification occurred in 9 of 113 patients (8.0%, 95% CI 4.1-14.6%). Five patients were upstaged from low-intermediate to high-intermediate risk, and four patients were upstaged from high-intermediate to high risk. BMB findings changed treatment planning in none of the 113 patients (0.0%, 95% CI 0.0-4.0%). CONCLUSION: Although BMB results upstaged the NCCN-IPI-based risk stratification in a small number of cases, this did not have any therapeutic implications in our patient series. These findings support the omission of BMB from routine staging of newly diagnosed DLBCL in the current risk stratification and treatment era.

25263646|t|The impact of ICD-9 revascularization procedure codes on estimates of racial disparities in ischemic stroke.
25263646|a|BACKGROUND: The use of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9) diagnostic codes can identify racial disparities in ischemic stroke hospitalizations; however, inclusion of revascularization procedure codes as acute stroke events may affect the magnitude of the risk difference. This study assesses the impact of excluding revascularization procedure codes in the ICD-9 definition of ischemic stroke, compared with the traditional inclusive definition, on racial disparity estimates for stroke incidence and recurrence. METHODS: Patients discharged with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke (ICD-9 codes 433.00-434.91 and 436) were identified from a statewide inpatient discharge database from 2010 to 2012. Race-age specific disparity estimates of stroke incidence and recurrence and 1-year cumulative recurrent stroke rates were compared between the routinely used traditional classification and a modified classification of stroke that excluded primary ICD-9 cerebral revascularization procedures codes (38.12, 00.61, and 00.63). RESULTS: The traditional classification identified 7878 stroke hospitalizations, whereas the modified classification resulted in 18% fewer hospitalizations (n = 6444). The age-specific black to white rate ratios were significantly higher in the modified than in the traditional classification for stroke incidence (rate ratio, 1.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.43-1.58 vs. rate ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.18-1.30, respectively). In whites, the 1-year cumulative recurrence rate was significantly reduced by 46% (45-64 years) and 49% (>= 65 years) in the modified classification, largely explained by a higher rate of cerebral revascularization procedures among whites. There were nonsignificant reductions of 14% (45-64 years) and 19% (>= 65 years) among blacks. CONCLUSIONS: Including cerebral revascularization procedure codes overestimates hospitalization rates for ischemic stroke and significantly underestimates the racial disparity estimates in stroke incidence and recurrence.

25265274|t|Hydrogen/deuterium exchange-protected oligomers populated during Abeta fibril formation correlate with neuronal cell death.
25265274|a|The aggregation of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) to form fibrils and plaques is strongly associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although it is well established that this process generates neurotoxicity, it is also heterogeneous with a variety of species being formed during the conversion process. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to detect and characterize each of the aggregates formed, which precludes establishing the specific features responsible for the neurotoxicity observed. Here we use pulse-labeling hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PL-HDX-ESI-MS) to distinguish three ensembles populated during the aggregation of the 40 and 42 residue forms of the Abeta peptide, Abeta40 and Abeta42, on the basis of differences in their persistent structure. Noticeably, two of them are more abundant at the beginning and at the end of the lag phase and are therefore not detectable by conventional assays such as Thioflavin T (ThT). The ensembles populated at different stages of the aggregation process have a surprisingly consistent average degree of exchange, indicating that there are definite structural transitions between the different stages of aggregation. To determine whether an ensemble of species with a given hydrogen exchange pattern correlates with neurotoxicity, we combined PL-HDX-ESI-MS experiments with parallel measurements of the neurotoxicity of the samples under study. The results of this dual approach show that the maximum toxicity correlates with the ensemble comprising HDX protected oligomers, indicating that development of persistent structure within Abeta oligomers is a determinant of neurotoxicity.

25266592|t|Regional amyloid burden and intrinsic connectivity networks in cognitively normal elderly subjects.
25266592|a|Although previous studies demonstrated decreased functional connectivity in the default mode network in the cognitively normal older adults with amyloid burden, effects of amyloid burden in the other large-scale intrinsic connectivity networks are not yet clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the distinctive association pattern of amyloid-beta deposition on the three large-scale intrinsic connectivity networks (the default mode network, salience network and central executive network) in older adults with normal cognition. Fifty-six older adults with normal cognition underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging and were dichotomized using 11C-labelled Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography imaging into subjects with (PiB+; n=27) and without (PiB-; n=29) detectable amyloid burden. We found that the functional connectivities of (i) the default mode network were greater; (ii) the salience network were not different; and (iii) the central executive network were lower in the Pittsburgh compound B positive group, compared with the Pittsburgh compound B negative group. Anterior cingulate cortex Pittsburgh compound B retention was negatively correlated with the functional connectivities of the posterior default mode network, and positively correlated with fronto-parietal functional connectivity (within the central executive network) in the Pittsburgh compound B positive group. The anti-correlation strength between the default mode network and the central executive network was negatively correlated with the anterior cingulate cortex Pittsburgh compound B levels. Additionally, significant group x episodic memory interactions with functional connectivities in the posterior default mode network, and the frontal default mode network were observed. Our results of aberrant default mode network functional connectivity and distinctive correlation patterns between the Pittsburgh compound B retention in the anterior cingulate cortex and functional connectivities in the default mode network and central executive network in the Pittsburgh compound B positive group might reflect a detrimental effect of amyloid retention on functional changes in the course of Alzheimer's disease progression.

25267639|t|Resting-state networks link invasive and noninvasive brain stimulation across diverse psychiatric and neurological diseases.
25267639|a|Brain stimulation, a therapy increasingly used for neurological and psychiatric disease, traditionally is divided into invasive approaches, such as deep brain stimulation (DBS), and noninvasive approaches, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation. The relationship between these approaches is unknown, therapeutic mechanisms remain unclear, and the ideal stimulation site for a given technique is often ambiguous, limiting optimization of the stimulation and its application in further disorders. In this article, we identify diseases treated with both types of stimulation, list the stimulation sites thought to be most effective in each disease, and test the hypothesis that these sites are different nodes within the same brain network as defined by resting-state functional-connectivity MRI. Sites where DBS was effective were functionally connected to sites where noninvasive brain stimulation was effective across diseases including depression, Parkinson's disease, obsessive-compulsive disorder, essential tremor, addiction, pain, minimally conscious states, and Alzheimer's disease. A lack of functional connectivity identified sites where stimulation was ineffective, and the sign of the correlation related to whether excitatory or inhibitory noninvasive stimulation was found clinically effective. These results suggest that resting-state functional connectivity may be useful for translating therapy between stimulation modalities, optimizing treatment, and identifying new stimulation targets. More broadly, this work supports a network perspective toward understanding and treating neuropsychiatric disease, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeted brain network modulation.

25268274|t|Targeting delivery of liposomes with conjugated p-aminophenyl-alpha-d-manno-pyranoside and apolipoprotein E for inhibiting neuronal degeneration insulted with beta-amyloid peptide.
25268274|a|Liposomes with conjugated p-aminophenyl-alpha-d-manno-pyranoside (APMP) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) (APMP-ApoE-liposomes) were employed to carry neuron growth factor (NGF) across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and enhance the survival of degenerated neurons. APMP-ApoE-liposomes were used to deliver NGF across a monolayer of human brain-microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) regulated by human astrocytes (HAs) for rescuing SK-N-MC cells from an insult of beta-amyloid peptide 1-42 (Abeta1-42). An increase in the APMP concentration enhanced the particle size, HBMEC and HA viability, permeability for propidium iodide (PI), and permeability for NGF, however, reduced the absolute value of zeta potential, APMP conjugation efficiency and transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER). In addition, an increase in the ApoE concentration increased the particle size, absolute value of zeta potential, HBMEC and HA viability, permeability for PI, permeability for NGF and SK-N-MC cell viability, however, decreased the ApoE conjugation efficiency and TEER. APMP and ApoE on liposomes can be promising surface moieties to carry NGF across the BBB, target degenerated neurons and inhibit Abeta1-42-induced neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease.

25270989|t|Defective macroautophagic turnover of brain lipids in the TgCRND8 Alzheimer mouse model: prevention by correcting lysosomal proteolytic deficits.
25270989|a|Autophagy, the major lysosomal pathway for the turnover of intracellular organelles is markedly impaired in neurons in Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer mouse models. We have previously reported that severe lysosomal and amyloid neuropathology and associated cognitive deficits in the TgCRND8 Alzheimer mouse model can be ameliorated by restoring lysosomal proteolytic capacity and autophagy flux via genetic deletion of the lysosomal protease inhibitor, cystatin B. Here we present evidence that macroautophagy is a significant pathway for lipid turnover, which is defective in TgCRND8 brain where lipids accumulate as membranous structures and lipid droplets within giant neuronal autolysosomes. Levels of multiple lipid species including several sphingolipids (ceramide, ganglioside GM3, GM2, GM1, GD3 and GD1a), cardiolipin, cholesterol and cholesteryl esters are elevated in autophagic vacuole fractions and lysosomes isolated from TgCRND8 brain. Lipids are localized in autophagosomes and autolysosomes by double immunofluorescence analyses in wild-type mice and colocalization is increased in TgCRND8 mice where abnormally abundant GM2 ganglioside-positive granules are detected in neuronal lysosomes. Cystatin B deletion in TgCRND8 significantly reduces the number of GM2-positive granules and lowers the levels of GM2 and GM3 in lysosomes, decreases lipofuscin-related autofluorescence, and eliminates giant lipid-containing autolysosomes while increasing numbers of normal-sized autolysosomes/lysosomes with reduced content of undigested components. These findings have identified macroautophagy as a previously unappreciated route for delivering membrane lipids to lysosomes for turnover, a function that has so far been considered to be mediated exclusively through the endocytic pathway, and revealed that autophagic-lysosomal dysfunction in TgCRND8 brain impedes lysosomal turnover of lipids as well as proteins. The amelioration of lipid accumulation in TgCRND8 by removing cystatin B inhibition on lysosomal proteases suggests that enhancing lysosomal proteolysis improves the overall environment of the lysosome and its clearance functions, which may be possibly relevant to a broader range of lysosomal disorders beyond Alzheimer's disease.

25274111|t|Pomegranate extract modulates processing of amyloid-beta precursor protein in an aged Alzheimer's disease animal model.
25274111|a|Accumulating research supports the neuroprotective effects of pomegranate (Punica granatum) juice and extracts against Alzheimer's disease (AD) but there is limited data available in animal models. Here we investigated the effects of a standardized pomegranate extract (PE) on AD pathology in an aged transgenic AD animal model (R1.40).The mice (age 24-30 months) received either PE (at 100 and 200 mg/kg) or a control solution daily for three weeks, and were evaluated in the Morris water maze and the Y-maze for improvements in spatial long-term and working memory functions. Cortical amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) and amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels, along with other relevant biomarkers for AD, were measured in brain tissues. PE did not improve cognitive performance of the mice, but altered levels and ratio of the Abeta42 and Abeta40 peptides which would favor a diminution in AD pathogenesis. Further analysis revealed that this reversal could be the product of the modification of gamma-secretase enzyme activity, the enzyme involved in the generation of these Abeta isoforms. Our findings support a specific anti-amyloidogenic mechanism of a pomegranate extract in this aged AD animal model.

25274114|t|Ameliorative effects of baicalein on an amyloid-beta induced Alzheimer's disease rat model: a proteomics study.
25274114|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of age-related dementia. Effective anti-AD drugs against amyloid-beta-protein-induced cognitive impairment are still lacking. Baicalein is the main component of Radix Scutellariae and has neuroprotective properties. In this study, we provide further insights into pharmacotherapy mechanisms and potential targets of baicalein in AD. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the therapeutic effects and mechanism of action of baicalein in an AD rat model. METHODS: Male rats were intracerebroventricularly injected with amyloid-beta(Abeta) 1-40, and baicalein was orally administered. The therapeutic effect was evaluated with the Morris water maze test, and the mechanism of action was studied using a proteomics approach and western blotting. RESULTS: Baicalein treatment significantly attenuated Abeta1-40-induced abnormalities in cognitive function. Additionally, the expression levels of 24 proteins in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus were significantly influenced by baicalein; approximately 50% of these proteins are related to energy metabolism and neurotransmission, whereas others are related to anti-apoptosis, anti-oxidation, the stress response, protein phosphorylation, the cytoskeleton, phospholipid metabolism and cell signaling. The expression of these proteins was increased, except for the proteins related to the cytoskeleton. The changes in the expression of 2 proteins were confirmed by western blotting. CONCLUSIONS: Baicalein ameliorates the Abeta1-40-induced dementia in rats and may be a novel and promising drug for the treatment of AD. The therapeutic mechanism may be related to modulation of a number of processes, mainly through the promotion of energy metabolism and neurotransmission, with the additional promotion of anti-apoptosis, anti-oxidation, protein phosphorylation, etc.

25274811|t|The amyloid precursor protein controls adult hippocampal neurogenesis through GABAergic interneurons.
25274811|a|Impaired neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus has been implicated in AD pathogenesis. Here we reveal that the APP plays an important role in the neural progenitor proliferation and newborn neuron maturation in the mouse dentate gyrus. APP controls adult neurogenesis through a non cell-autonomous mechanism by GABAergic neurons, as selective deletion of GABAergic, but not glutamatergic, APP disrupts adult hippocampal neurogenesis. APP, highly expressed in the majority of GABAergic neurons in the dentate gyrus, enhances the inhibitory tone to granule cells. By regulating both tonic and phasic GABAergic inputs to dentate granule cells, APP maintains excitatory-inhibitory balance and preserves cognitive functions. Our studies uncover an indispensable role of APP in the GABAergic system for controlling adult hippocampal neurogenesis, and our findings indicate that APP dysfunction may contribute to impaired neurogenesis and cognitive decline associated with AD.

25274849|t|Midlife personality and risk of Alzheimer disease and distress: a 38-year follow-up.
25274849|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the association between midlife neuroticism and extraversion and development of late-life dementia and long-standing distress in a sample of women followed for 38 years. METHODS: A population-based sample of 800 women, aged 38 to 54 years, was examined in 1968, with subsequent examinations in 1974, 1980, 1992, 2000, and 2005. Neuroticism and extraversion were assessed using the Eysenck Personality Inventory at baseline. Distress was measured according to a standardized question at each study wave. Dementia was diagnosed according to DSM-III-R criteria based on information from neuropsychiatric examinations, informant interviews, hospital records, and registry data. RESULTS: During the 38-year follow-up, 153 women developed dementia; Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia was diagnosed in 104 of these. A higher degree of neuroticism in midlife was associated with increased risk of AD dementia and long-standing distress over 38 years. The association between neuroticism and AD dementia diminished after adjusting for long-standing distress. Extraversion was associated with a lower degree of long-standing distress, but had no impact on AD dementia. When the 2 personality dimensions were combined, high neuroticism/low extraversion showed the highest risk of AD dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that midlife neuroticism is associated with increased risk of AD dementia, and that distress mediates this association. The results have clinical implications because a group of women at risk of AD dementia is identified.

25275636|t|Beta-amyloid oligomers induce early loss of presynaptic proteins in primary neurons by caspase-dependent and proteasome-dependent mechanisms.
25275636|a|Beta-amyloid is a major pathogenic molecule for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and can be aggregated into a soluble oligomer, which is a toxic intermediate, before amyloid fibril formation. Beta-amyloid oligomers are associated closely with early synaptic loss in AD. However, it is still unknown which synaptic proteins are involved in the synaptotoxicity, and a direct comparison among the synaptic proteins should also be addressed. Here, we investigated changes in the expression of several presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins in primary neurons after treatment with a low-molecular weight and a high-molecular weight beta-amyloid oligomer. Both oligomers induced early neuronal dysfunction after 4 h and significantly reduced presynaptic protein (synaptophysin, syntaxin, synapsin, and synaptotagmin) expression. However, the expression of postsynaptic proteins (PSD95, NMDAR2A/B, and GluR2/3), except NMDAR1 was not reduced, and some protein expression levels were increased. Glutamate treatment, which is correlated with postsynaptic activation, showed more postsynaptic-specific protein loss compared with beta-amyloid oligomer treatment. Finally, the caspase inhibitor zVAD and the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 attenuated presynaptic protein loss. Thus, our data showed changes in synaptic proteins by beta-amyloid oligomers, which provides an understanding of early synaptotoxicity and suggests new approaches for AD treatment.

25278875|t|Amyloid-clearing proteins and their epigenetic regulation as a therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease.
25278875|a|Abnormal elevation of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) levels in the brain is the primary trigger for neuronal cell death specific to Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is now evident that Abeta levels in the brain are manipulable due to a dynamic equilibrium between its production from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and removal by amyloid clearance proteins. Clearance can be either enzymic or non-enzymic (binding/transport proteins). Intriguingly several of the main amyloid-degrading enzymes (ADEs) are members of the M13 peptidase family (neprilysin (NEP), NEP2 and the endothelin converting enzymes (ECE-1 and -2)). A distinct metallopeptidase, insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), also contributes to Abeta degradation in the brain. The ADE family currently embraces more than 20 members, both membrane-bound and soluble, and of differing cellular locations. NEP plays an important role in brain function terminating neuropeptide signals. Its decrease in specific brain areas with age or after hypoxia, ischaemia or stroke contribute significantly to the development of AD pathology. The recently discovered mechanism of epigenetic regulation of NEP (and other genes) by the APP intracellular domain (AICD) and its dependence on the cell type and APP isoform expression suggest possibilities for selective manipulation of NEP gene expression in neuronal cells. We have also observed that another amyloid-clearing protein, namely transthyretin (TTR), is also regulated in the neuronal cell by a mechanism similar to NEP. Dependence of amyloid clearance proteins on histone deacetylases and the ability of HDAC inhibitors to up-regulate their expression in the brain opens new avenues for developing preventive strategies in AD.

25279986|t|Genome-wide association study identifies five susceptibility loci for follicular lymphoma outside the HLA region.
25279986|a|Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of follicular lymphoma (FL) have previously identified human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene variants. To identify additional FL susceptibility loci, we conducted a large-scale two-stage GWAS in 4,523 case subjects and 13,344 control subjects of European ancestry. Five non-HLA loci were associated with FL risk: 11q23.3 (rs4938573, p = 5.79 x 10(-20)) near CXCR5; 11q24.3 (rs4937362, p = 6.76 x 10(-11)) near ETS1; 3q28 (rs6444305, p = 1.10 x 10(-10)) in LPP; 18q21.33 (rs17749561, p = 8.28 x 10(-10)) near BCL2; and 8q24.21 (rs13254990, p = 1.06 x 10(-8)) near PVT1. In an analysis of the HLA region, we identified four linked HLA-DRbeta1 multiallelic amino acids at positions 11, 13, 28, and 30 that were associated with FL risk (pomnibus = 4.20 x 10(-67) to 2.67 x 10(-70)). Additional independent signals included rs17203612 in HLA class II (odds ratio [OR(per-allele)] = 1.44; p = 4.59 x 10(-16)) and rs3130437 in HLA class I (OR(per-allele) = 1.23; p = 8.23 x 10(-9)). Our findings further expand the number of loci associated with FL and provide evidence that multiple common variants outside the HLA region make a significant contribution to FL risk.

25281129|t|A highly sensitive resonance light scattering probe for Alzheimer's amyloid-beta peptide based on Fe3O4@Au composites.
25281129|a|The fabrication of Fe3O4@Au composites as a novel resonance light scattering (RLS) probe for the sensitive detection of Alzheimer's amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) was demonstrated. Amino groups coated magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles were covered with gold shell by the classical Frens method. The resultant colloids were characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and UV-visible spectra. The results indicated that the composite particles with core/shell structure and an average diameter of ~ 320 nm were stable and biocompatible. The RLS intensity of Fe3O4@Au composites was significantly enhanced by interacting with Abeta. Under optimal conditions, good linear relationship between the ratio of RLS intensity I/I0 at 463.0 nm and the logarithmic value of Abeta concentration in the range of 5.0 x 10(-15)-5.56 x 10(-9)M was found. The limit of detection (LOD) was 1.2 x 10(-15)M. The proposed method is simple, sensitive and cost-effective and complementary to other existing methods for protein analysis.

25281433|t|Brainstem oligodendroglial tumors in children: two case reports and review of literatures.
25281433|a|PURPOSE: There is little information on pediatric oligodendroglial tumor located in the brainstem because of its rarity. METHODS: Here, we present two pediatric cases of pontine oligodendroglial tumors with radiological findings atypical for diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. RESULTS: The first patient was an 8-year-old boy. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated diffuse high-intensity changes in the pons, left middle cerebellar peduncle, and part of the left cerebellar hemisphere on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, with an enhanced spot lesion in the left cerebellar hemisphere. The pathological diagnosis was anaplastic oligodendroglioma, and we identified a mutation in histone H3.3 in the tumor specimen. He succumbed to massive disseminated relapse 7 months from diagnosis despite local radiation therapy. The second patient, a 2-year-old girl, was diagnosed with oligoastrocytoma. Brain MRI revealed a large mass in her rostral pons extended to the fourth ventricle with obstructive hydrocephalus. The tumor recurred with intracranial dissemination 56 months post-surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric brainstem oligodendroglial tumors can include histone H3.3-mutated tumors and have a tendency to disseminate throughout the neuroaxis at the time of relapse.

25281534|t|Design of non-aggregating variants of Abeta peptide.
25281534|a|Self association of the amyloid-beta (Abeta42) peptide into oligomers, high molecular weight forms, fibrils and ultimately neuritic plaques, has been correlated with progressive cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. Thus, insights into the drivers of the aggregation pathway have the capacity to significantly contribute to our understanding of disease mechanism. Functional assays and a three-dimensional crystal structure of the P3 amyloidogenic region 18-41 of Abeta were used to identify residues important in self-association and to design novel non-aggregating variants of the peptide. Biophysical studies (gel filtration, SDS-PAGE, dynamic light scattering, thioflavin T assay, and electron microscopy) demonstrate that in contrast to wild type Abeta these targeted mutations lose the ability to self-associate. Loss of aggregation also correlates with reduced neuronal toxicity. Our results highlight residues and regions of the Abeta peptide important for future targeting agents aimed at the amelioration of Alzheimer's disease.

25281743|t|Monoclonal antibodies against Abeta42 fibrils distinguish multiple aggregation state polymorphisms in vitro and in Alzheimer disease brain.
25281743|a|Amyloidogenic proteins generally form intermolecularly hydrogen-bonded beta-sheet aggregates, including parallel, in-register beta-sheets (recognized by antiserum OC) or antiparallel beta-sheets, beta-solenoids, beta-barrels, and beta-cylindrins (recognized by antiserum A11). Although these groups share many common properties, some amyloid sequences have been reported to form polymorphic structural variants or strains. We investigated the humoral immune response to Abeta42 fibrils and produced 23 OC-type monoclonal antibodies recognizing distinct epitopes differentially associated with polymorphic structural variants. These mOC antibodies define at least 18 different immunological profiles represented in aggregates of amyloid-beta (Abeta). All of the antibodies strongly prefer amyloid aggregates over monomer, indicating that they recognize conformational epitopes. Most of the antibodies react with N-terminal linear segments of Abeta, although many recognize a discontinuous epitope consisting of an N-terminal domain and a central domain. Several of the antibodies that recognize linear Abeta segments also react with fibrils formed from unrelated amyloid sequences, indicating that reactivity with linear segments of Abeta does not mean the antibody is sequence-specific. The antibodies display strikingly different patterns of immunoreactivity in Alzheimer disease and transgenic mouse brain and identify spatially and temporally unique amyloid deposits. Our results indicate that the immune response to Abeta42 fibrils is diverse and reflects the structural polymorphisms in fibrillar amyloid structures. These polymorphisms may contribute to differences in toxicity and consequent effects on pathological processes. Thus, a single therapeutic monoclonal antibody may not be able to target all of the pathological aggregates necessary to make an impact on the overall disease process.

25281744|t|Cyclopamine modulates gamma-secretase-mediated cleavage of amyloid precursor protein by altering its subcellular trafficking and lysosomal degradation.
25281744|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease leading to memory loss. Numerous lines of evidence suggest that amyloid-beta (Abeta), a neurotoxic peptide, initiates a cascade that results in synaptic dysfunction, neuronal death, and eventually cognitive deficits. Abeta is generated by the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), and alterations to this processing can result in Alzheimer disease. Using in vitro and in vivo models, we identified cyclopamine as a novel regulator of gamma-secretase-mediated cleavage of APP. We demonstrate that cyclopamine decreases Abeta generation by altering APP retrograde trafficking. Specifically, cyclopamine treatment reduced APP-C-terminal fragment (CTF) delivery to the trans-Golgi network where gamma-secretase cleavage occurs. Instead, cyclopamine redirects APP-CTFs to the lysosome. These data demonstrate that cyclopamine treatment decreases gamma-secretase-mediated cleavage of APP. In addition, cyclopamine treatment decreases the rate of APP-CTF degradation. Together, our data demonstrate that cyclopamine alters APP processing and Abeta generation by inducing changes in APP subcellular trafficking and APP-CTF degradation.

25281826|t|Region-specific metabolic alterations in the brain of the APP/PS1 transgenic mice of Alzheimer's disease.
25281826|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide, but its etiology is still not completely understood. The identification of underlying pathological mechanisms is becoming increasingly important for the discovery of biomarkers and therapies, for which metabolomics presents a great potential. In this work, we studied metabolic alterations in different brain regions of the APP/PS1 mice by using a high-throughput metabolomic approach based on the combination of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Multivariate statistics showed that metabolomic perturbations are widespread, affecting mainly the hippocampus and the cortex, but are also present in regions not primarily associated with AD such as the striatum, cerebellum and olfactory bulbs. Multiple metabolic pathways could be linked to the development of AD-type disorders in this mouse model, including abnormal purine metabolism, bioenergetic failures, dyshomeostasis of amino acids and disturbances in membrane lipids, among others. Interestingly, region-specific alterations were observed for some of the potential markers identified, associated with abnormal fatty acid composition of phospholipids and sphingomyelins, or differential regulation of neurotransmitter amino acids (e.g. glutamate, glycine, serine, N-acetyl-aspartate), not previously described to our knowledge. Therefore, these findings could provide a new insight into brain pathology in Alzheimer's disease.

25281869|t|Immunotherapy alleviates amyloid-associated synaptic pathology in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model.
25281869|a|Cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease is attributed to loss of functional synapses, most likely caused by synaptotoxic, oligomeric forms of amyloid-beta. Many treatment options aim at reducing amyloid-beta levels in the brain, either by decreasing its production or by increasing its clearance. We quantified the effects of immunotherapy directed against oligomeric amyloid-beta in Tg2576 mice, a mouse model of familial Alzheimer's disease. Treatment of 12-month-old mice with oligomer-specific (A-887755) or conformation-unspecific (6G1) antibodies for 8 weeks did not affect fibrillar plaque density or growth. We also quantified densities of DLG4 (previously known as PSD95) expressing post-synapses and synapsin expressing presynapses immunohistochemically. We found that both pre- and post-synapses were strongly reduced in the vicinity of plaques, whereas distant from plaques, in the cortex and hippocampal CA1 field, only post-synapses were reduced. Immunotherapy alleviated this synapse loss. Synapse loss was completely abolished distant from plaques, whereas it was only attenuated in the vicinity of plaques. These results suggest that fibrillar plaques may act as reservoirs for synaptotoxic, oligomeric amyloid-beta and that sequestering oligomers suffices to counteract synaptic pathology. Therefore, cognitive function may be improved by immunotherapy even when the load of fibrillar amyloid remains unchanged.

25282381|t|Guidelines for the standardization of preanalytic variables for blood-based biomarker studies in Alzheimer's disease research.
25282381|a|The lack of readily available biomarkers is a significant hindrance toward progressing to effective therapeutic and preventative strategies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Blood-based biomarkers have potential to overcome access and cost barriers and greatly facilitate advanced neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid biomarker approaches. Despite the fact that preanalytical processing is the largest source of variability in laboratory testing, there are no currently available standardized preanalytical guidelines. The current international working group provides the initial starting point for such guidelines for standardized operating procedures (SOPs). It is anticipated that these guidelines will be updated as additional research findings become available. The statement provides (1) a synopsis of selected preanalytical methods utilized in many international AD cohort studies, (2) initial draft guidelines/SOPs for preanalytical methods, and (3) a list of required methodological information and protocols to be made available for publications in the field to foster cross-validation across cohorts and laboratories.

25284012|t|In vitro and in vivo characterization of several functionalized ultrasmall particles of iron oxide, vectorized against amyloid plaques and potentially able to cross the blood-brain barrier: toward earlier diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease by molecular imaging.
25284012|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder most often diagnosed 10 years after its onset and development. It is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide (ABP) into amyloid plaques between nerve cells, which produces a massive local neurodegeneration. Molecular magnetic resonance imaging allows diagnosis of AD by showing ABP accumulation in the brain. The ultrasmall particles of iron oxide (USPIO) derivatives proposed in the present work were functionalized with peptides that present an affinity for ABP, independently of its state of aggregation. Their nanomolar Kd * confirms the high affinity of our vectorized contrast agents (VCA) for ABP and therefore their high labeling potential, specificity and sensitivity. Their lack of toxicity has been demonstrated, both by in vitro studies using the MTT method on several cell types, and by in vivo investigations with assessment of renal and hepatic biomarkers and by histopathology evaluation. The results of biodistribution studies corroborated by MRI demonstrate that USPIO-PHO (USPIO coupled to peptide C-IPLPFYN-C) are able to cross the blood-brain barrier without any facilitating strategy, and accumulates in the brain 90 min after its injection in NMRI mice. None of the USPIO derivatives were found in any organs one week after administration. To conclude, USPIO-PHO seems to have a genuine potential for labeling amyloid plaques in the brain; it has a nanomolar binding affinity, no toxic effects, and its elimination half-life is about 3 h. Further tests will be made on transgenic mice, aimed at confirming the potential of early AD diagnosis using our VCA.

25284792|t|Modeling cerebrovascular pathophysiology in amyloid-beta metabolism using neural-crest-derived smooth muscle cells.
25284792|a|There is growing recognition of cerebrovascular contributions to neurodegenerative diseases. In the walls of cerebral arteries, amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation is evident in a majority of aged people and patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Here, we leverage human pluripotent stem cells to generate vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) from neural crest progenitors, recapitulating brain-vasculature-specific attributes of Abeta metabolism. We confirm that the lipoprotein receptor, LRP1, functions in our neural-crest-derived SMCs to mediate Abeta uptake and intracellular lysosomal degradation. Hypoxia significantly compromises the contribution of SMCs to Abeta clearance by suppressing LRP1 expression. This enabled us to develop an assay of Abeta uptake by using the neural crest-derived SMCs with hypoxia as a stress paradigm. We then tested several vascular protective compounds in a high-throughput format, demonstrating the value of stem-cell-based phenotypic screening for novel therapeutics and drug repurposing, aimed at alleviating amyloid burden.

25285718|t|Development and validation of the Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Questionnaire-4 (SATAQ-4).
25285718|a|The Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Questionnaire-3 (SATAQ-3) and its earlier versions are measures designed to assess societal and interpersonal aspects of appearance ideals. Correlational, structural equation modeling, and prospective studies of the SATAQ-3 have shown consistent and significant associations with measures of body image disturbance and eating pathology. In the current investigation, the SATAQ-3 was revised to improve upon some conceptual limitations and was evaluated in 4 U.S. and 3 international female samples, as well as a U.S. male sample. In Study 1, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses for a sample of women from the Southeastern United States (N = 859) indicated a 22-item scale with 5 factors: Internalization: Thin/Low Body Fat, Internalization: Muscular/Athletic, Pressures: Family, Pressures: Media, Pressures: Peers. This scale structure was confirmed in 3 independent and geographically diverse samples of women from the United States (East Coast N = 440, West Coast N = 304, and North/Midwest N = 349). SATAQ-4 scale scores demonstrated excellent reliability and good convergent validity with measures of body image, eating disturbance, and self-esteem. Study 2 replicated the factorial validity, reliability, and convergent validity of the SATAQ-4 in an international sample of women drawn from Italy, England, and Australia (N = 362). Study 3 examined a sample of college males from the United States (N = 271); the 5-factor solution was largely replicated, yet there was some evidence of an underlying structure unique to men. Future research avenues include additional item testing and modification of the scale for men, as well as adaptation of the measure for children and adolescents.

25285942|t|Effect of potent gamma-secretase modulator in human neurons derived from multiple presenilin 1-induced pluripotent stem cell mutant carriers.
25285942|a|IMPORTANCE: Although considerable effort has been expended developing drug candidates for Alzheimer disease, none have yet succeeded owing to the lack of efficacy or to safety concerns. One potential shortcoming of current approaches to Alzheimer disease drug discovery and development is that they rely primarily on transformed cell lines and animal models that substantially overexpress wild-type or mutant proteins. It is possible that drug development failures thus far are caused in part by the limits of these approaches, which do not accurately reveal how drug candidates will behave in naive human neuronal cells. OBJECTIVE: To analyze purified neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells from patients carrying 3 different presenilin 1 (PS1) mutations and nondemented control individuals in the absence of any overexpression. We tested the efficacy of gamma-secretase inhibitor and gamma-secretase modulator (GSM) in neurons derived from both normal control and 3 PS1 mutations (A246E, H163R, and M146L). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Adult human skin biopsies were obtained from volunteers at the Alzheimer Disease Research Center, University of California, San Diego. Cell cultures were treated with gamma-secretase inhibitor or GSM. Comparisons of total beta-amyloid (Abeta) and Abeta peptides 38, 40, and 42 in the media were made between vehicle- vs drug-treated cultures. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Soluble Abeta levels in the media were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: As predicted, mutant PS1 neurons exhibited an elevated Abeta42:Abeta40 ratio (P < .05) at the basal state as compared with the nondemented control neurons. Treatment with a potent non-nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory druglike GSM revealed a new biomarker signature that differs from all previous cell types and animals tested. This new signature was the same in both the mutant and control neurons and consisted of a reduction in Abeta42, Abeta40, and Abeta38 and in the Abeta42:Abeta40 ratio, with no change in the total Abeta levels. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This biomarker discrepancy is likely due to overexpression of amyloid precursor protein in the transformed cellular models. Our results suggest that biomarker signatures obtained with such models are misleading and that human neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells provide a unique signature that will more accurately reflect drug response in human patients and in cerebrospinal fluid biomarker changes observed during GSM treatment.

25286118|t|Sigma-1 (sigma1) receptor deficiency reduces beta-amyloid(25-35)-induced hippocampal neuronal cell death and cognitive deficits through suppressing phosphorylation of the NMDA receptor NR2B.
25286118|a|In early Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, reduction of sigma-1 receptors (sigma1R) is detected. In this study, we employed male heterozygous sigma1R knockout (sigma1R(+/-)) mice showing normal cognitive performance to investigate association of sigma1R deficiency with AD risk. Herein we report that a single injection (i.c.v.) of Abeta(25-35) impaired spatial memory with approximately 25% death of pyramidal cells in the hippocampal CA1 region of WT mice (Abeta(25-35)-WT mice), whereas it did not cause such impairments in sigma1R(+/-) mice (Abeta(25-35)-sigma1R(+/-) mice). Compared with WT mice, Abeta(25-35)-WT mice showed increased levels of NMDA-activated currents (INMDA) and NR2B phosphorylation (phospho-NR2B) in the hippocampal CA1 region at 48 h after Abeta25-35-injection (post-Abeta(25-35)) followed by approximately 40% decline at 72 h post-Abeta(25-35) of their respective control levels, which was inhibited by the sigma1R antagonist NE100. In Abeta(25-35)-WT mice, the administration of NR2B inhibitor Ro25-6981 or NE100 on day 1-4 post-Abeta(25-35) attenuated the memory deficits and loss of pyramidal cells. By contrast, Abeta(25-35)-sigma1R(+/-) mice showed a slight increase in the INMDA density and the phospho-NR2B at 48 h or 72 h post-Abeta25-35 compared to sigma1R(+/-) mice. Treatment with sigma1R agonist PRE084 in Abeta(25-35)-sigma1R(+/-) mice caused the same changes in the INMDA density and the phospho-NR2B as those in Abeta(25-35)-WT mice. Furthermore, Abeta(25-35)-sigma1R(+/-) mice treated with the NMDA receptor agonist NMDA or PRE084 on day 1-4 post-Abeta(25-35) showed a loss of neuronal cells and memory impairment. These results indicate that the sigma1R deficiency can reduce Abeta(25-35)-induced neuronal cell death and cognitive deficits through suppressing Abeta(25-35)-enhanced NR2B phosphorylation.

25287075|t|Observer reliability of CT angiography in the assessment of acute ischaemic stroke: data from the Third International Stroke Trial.
25287075|a|INTRODUCTION: CT angiography (CTA) is often used for assessing patients with acute ischaemic stroke. Only limited observer reliability data exist. We tested inter- and intra-observer reliability for the assessment of CTA in acute ischaemic stroke. METHODS: We selected 15 cases from the Third International Stroke Trial (IST-3, ISRCTN25765518) with various degrees of arterial obstruction in different intracranial locations on CTA. To assess inter-observer reliability, seven members of the IST-3 expert image reading panel (>5 years experience reading CTA) and seven radiology trainees (<2 years experience) rated all 15 scans independently and blind to clinical data for: presence (versus absence) of any intracranial arterial abnormality (stenosis or occlusion), severity of arterial abnormality using relevant scales (IST-3 angiography score, Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score, Clot Burden Score), collateral supply and visibility of a perfusion defect on CTA source images (CTA-SI). Intra-observer reliability was assessed using independently repeated expert panel scan ratings. We assessed observer agreement with Krippendorff's-alpha (K-alpha). RESULTS: Among experienced observers, inter-observer agreement was substantial for the identification of any angiographic abnormality (K-alpha = 0.70) and with an angiography assessment scale (K-alpha = 0.60-0.66). There was less agreement for grades of collateral supply (K-alpha = 0.56) or for identification of a perfusion defect on CTA-SI (K-alpha = 0.32). Radiology trainees performed as well as expert readers when additional training was undertaken (neuroradiology specialist trainees). Intra-observer agreement among experts provided similar results (K-alpha = 0.33-0.72). CONCLUSION: For most imaging characteristics assessed, CTA has moderate to substantial observer agreement in acute ischaemic stroke. Experienced readers and those with specialist training perform best.

25287799|t|Does beta-APP staining of the brain in infant bed-sharing deaths differentiate these cases from sudden infant death syndrome?
25287799|a|Archival cerebral tissue from infants whose deaths were attributed to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) from South Australia and Western Denmark were stained for beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP) and graded according to a simple scoring chart. The resulting APP scores were correlated with sleeping situation (shared vs. alone) showing a significantly higher amount of beta-APP staining in the non-bed-sharing, than in the bed-sharing infants (Mann-Whitney, Australia: p = 0.0128, Denmark: p = 0.0014, Combined: p = 0.0031). There was also a marked but non-significant difference in sex distribution between bed-sharers and non-bed-sharers with a male to female ratio of 1:1 in the first group and 2:1 in the latter. Of 48 Australian and 76 Danish SIDS infants, beta-APP staining was present in 116 (94%) cases. The eight negative cases were all from the Danish cohort. This study has shown that the amount of beta-APP staining was significantly higher in infants who were sleeping alone compared to those who were bed-sharing with one or more adults, in both an Australian and Danish cohort of SIDS infants. Whether this results from differences in the speed with which these infants die, differences in lethal mechanisms involving possible accidental asphyxiation in shared sleepers, or differences in the number of previous hypoxic-ischemic events, remains to be clarified.

25287911|t|The multifaceted nature of amyloid precursor protein and its proteolytic fragments: friends and foes.
25287911|a|The amyloid precursor protein (APP) has occupied a central position in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology, in large part due to the seminal role of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), a proteolytic fragment derived from APP. Although the contribution of Abeta to AD pathogenesis is accepted by many in the research community, recent studies have unveiled a more complicated picture of APP's involvement in neurodegeneration in that other APP-derived fragments have been shown to exert pathological influences on neuronal function. However, not all APP-derived peptides are neurotoxic, and some even harbor neuroprotective effects. In this review, we will explore this complex picture by first discussing the pleiotropic effects of the major APP-derived peptides cleaved by multiple proteases, including soluble APP peptides (sAPPalpha, sAPPbeta), various C- and N-terminal fragments, p3, and APP intracellular domain fragments. In addition, we will highlight two interesting sequences within APP that likely contribute to this duality in APP function. First, it has been found that caspase-mediated cleavage of APP in the cytosolic region may release a cytotoxic peptide, C31, which plays a role in synapse loss and neuronal death. Second, recent studies have implicated the -YENPTY- motif in the cytoplasmic region as a domain that modulates several APP activities through phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the first tyrosine residue. Thus, this review summarizes the current understanding of various APP proteolytic products and the interplay among them to gain deeper insights into the possible mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration and AD pathophysiology.

25287981|t|Fishing on chips: up-and-coming technological advances in analysis of zebrafish and Xenopus embryos.
25287981|a|Biotests performed on small vertebrate model organisms provide significant investigative advantages as compared with bioassays that employ cell lines, isolated primary cells, or tissue samples. The main advantage offered by whole-organism approaches is that the effects under study occur in the context of intact physiological milieu, with all its intercellular and multisystem interactions. The gap between the high-throughput cell-based in vitro assays and low-throughput, disproportionally expensive and ethically controversial mammal in vivo tests can be closed by small model organisms such as zebrafish or Xenopus. The optical transparency of their tissues, the ease of genetic manipulation and straightforward husbandry, explain the growing popularity of these model organisms. Nevertheless, despite the potential for miniaturization, automation and subsequent increase in throughput of experimental setups, the manipulation, dispensing and analysis of living fish and frog embryos remain labor-intensive. Recently, a new generation of miniaturized chip-based devices have been developed for zebrafish and Xenopus embryo on-chip culture and experimentation. In this work, we review the critical developments in the field of Lab-on-a-Chip devices designed to alleviate the limits of traditional platforms for studies on zebrafish and clawed frog embryo and larvae.   2014 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.

25288138|t|APOE and BDNF polymorphisms moderate amyloid beta-related cognitive decline in preclinical Alzheimer's disease.
25288138|a|Accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in the brain is associated with memory decline in healthy individuals as a prelude to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Genetic factors may moderate this decline. We examined the role of apolipoprotein E (e4 carrier[e4(+)], e4 non-carrier[e4(-)]) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF(Val/Val), BDNF(Met)) in the extent to which they moderate Abeta-related memory decline. Healthy adults (n=333, Mage=70 years) enrolled in the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle study underwent Abeta neuroimaging. Neuropsychological assessments were conducted at baseline, 18-, 36- and 54-month follow-ups. Abeta positron emission tomography neuroimaging was used to classify participants as Abeta(-) or Abeta(+). Relative to Abeta(-)e4(-), Abeta(+)e4(+) individuals showed significantly faster rates of cognitive decline over 54 months across all domains (d=0.40-1.22), while Abeta(+)e4(-) individuals showed significantly faster decline only on verbal episodic memory (EM). There were no differences in rates of cognitive change between Abeta(-)e4(-) and Abeta(-)e4(+) groups. Among Abeta(+) individuals, e4(+)/BDNF(Met) participants showed a significantly faster rate of decline on verbal and visual EM, and language over 54 months compared with e4(-)/BDNF(Val/Val) participants (d=0.90-1.02). At least two genetic loci affect the rate of Abeta-related cognitive decline. Abeta(+)e4(+)/BDNF(Met) individuals can expect to show clinically significant memory impairment after 3 years, whereas Abeta(+)e4(+)/BDNF(Val/Val) individuals can expect a similar degree of impairment after 10 years. Little decline over 54 months was observed in the Abeta(-) and Abeta(+) e4(-) groups, irrespective of BDNF status. These data raise important prognostic issues in managing preclinical AD, and should be considered in designing secondary preventative clinical trials.

25289893|t|Blood-brain barrier dysfunction and cerebral small vessel disease (arteriolosclerosis) in brains of older people.
25289893|a|The blood-brain barrier protects brain tissue from potentially harmful plasma components. Small vessel disease (SVD; also termed arteriolosclerosis) is common in the brains of older people and is associated with lacunar infarcts, leukoaraiosis, and vascular dementia. To determine whether plasma extravasation is associated with SVD, we immunolabeled the plasma proteins fibrinogen and immunoglobulin G, which are assumed to reflect blood-brain barrier dysfunction, in deep gray matter (DGM; anterior caudate-putamen) and deep subcortical white matter (DWM) in the brains of a well-characterized cohort of donated brains with minimal Alzheimer disease pathology (Braak Stages 0-II) (n = 84; aged 65 years or older). Morphometric measures of fibrinogen labeling were compared between people with neuropathologically defined SVD and aged control subjects. Parenchymal cellular labeling with fibrinogen and immunoglobulin G was detectable in DGM and DWM in many subjects (>70%). Quantitative measures of fibrinogen were not associated with SVD in DGM or DWM; SVD severity was correlated between DGM and DWM (p < 0.0001). Fibrinogen in DGM showed a modest association with a history of hypertension; DWM fibrinogen was associated with dementia and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (all p < 0.05). In DWM, SVD was associated with leukoaraiosis identified in life (p < 0.05), but fibrinogen was not. Our data suggest that, in aged brains, plasma extravasation and hence local blood-brain barrier dysfunction are common but do not support an association with SVD.

25293421|t|Oleuropein aglycone protects against pyroglutamylated-3 amyloid-ss toxicity: biochemical, epigenetic and functional correlates.
25293421|a|Amyloid-ss (Ass) fragments, oligomeric Ass aggregates, and pyroglutamylated-Ass peptides, as well as epigenetic mechanisms and autophagy dysfunction all appear to contribute in various ways to Alzheimer's disease progression. We previously showed that dietary supplementation of oleuropein aglycone, a natural phenol abundant in the extra virgin olive oil, can be protective by reducing Ass42 deposits in the brain of young and middle-aged TgCRND8 mice. Here, we extended our study to aged TgCRND8 mice showing increased pE3-Ass in the brain deposits. We report that oleuropein aglycone is active against glutaminylcyclase-catalyzed pE3-Ass generation reducing enzyme expression and interferes both with Ass42 and pE3-Ass aggregation. Moreover, the phenol astonishingly activates neuronal autophagy even in mice at advanced stage of pathology, where it increases histone 3 and 4 acetylation, which matches both a decrease of histone deacetylase 2 expression and a significant improvement of synaptic function. The occurrence of these functional, epigenetic, and histopathologic beneficial effects even at a late stage of the pathology suggests that the phenol could be beneficial at the therapeutic, in addition to the prevention, level.

25293506|t|Hydrogen sulfide-induced processing of the amyloid precursor protein in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells involves the PI3-K/Akt signaling pathway.
25293506|a|Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been recently categorized as a gasotransmitter, and it may be involved in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. However, whether H2S induces amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing remains unknown. In the present study, we tested the ability of H2S to mediate APP processing in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. We treated SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells with a range of sodium hydrosulfide (H2S donor) concentrations. Western blot analysis showed that H2S increased the generation of C83 and decreased the production of C99. Meanwhile, H2S increased the levels of a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10) mRNA and protein, but had no effect on TNF-alpha-converting enzyme (TACE, also known as ADAM17) mRNA and protein levels. H2S also induced a significant decrease of extracellular amyloid-beta42 (Abeta42). Furthermore, SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were assayed for activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) pathway. H2S activated the PI3-K pathway. Using specific inhibitor of PI3-K, we determined that the effects of H2S on APP processing and Abeta42 were blocked by LY 294002 (PI3-K inhibitor). These data indicate that H2S can induce APP processing, and this effect is dependent on activation of the PI3-K signaling pathway.

25294087|t|Uncertainties in predicting rice yield by current crop models under a wide range of climatic conditions.
25294087|a|Predicting rice (Oryza sativa) productivity under future climates is important for global food security. Ecophysiological crop models in combination with climate model outputs are commonly used in yield prediction, but uncertainties associated with crop models remain largely unquantified. We evaluated 13 rice models against multi-year experimental yield data at four sites with diverse climatic conditions in Asia and examined whether different modeling approaches on major physiological processes attribute to the uncertainties of prediction to field measured yields and to the uncertainties of sensitivity to changes in temperature and CO2 concentration [CO2 ]. We also examined whether a use of an ensemble of crop models can reduce the uncertainties. Individual models did not consistently reproduce both experimental and regional yields well, and uncertainty was larger at the warmest and coolest sites. The variation in yield projections was larger among crop models than variation resulting from 16 global climate model-based scenarios. However, the mean of predictions of all crop models reproduced experimental data, with an uncertainty of less than 10% of measured yields. Using an ensemble of eight models calibrated only for phenology or five models calibrated in detail resulted in the uncertainty equivalent to that of the measured yield in well-controlled agronomic field experiments. Sensitivity analysis indicates the necessity to improve the accuracy in predicting both biomass and harvest index in response to increasing [CO2 ] and temperature.

25294376|t|Relationship between post-operative cognitive dysfunction and regional cerebral oxygen saturation and beta-amyloid protein.
25294376|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) and regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) and beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) in patients undergoing laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy. METHODS: Fifty patients undergoing elective laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy received five groups of neuropsychological tests 1 d pre-operatively and 7 d post-operatively, with continuous monitoring of rSO2 intra-operatively. Before anesthesia induction (t0), at the beginning of laparoscopy (t1), and at the time of pneumoperitoneum 120 min (t2), pneumoperitoneum 240 min (t3), pneumoperitoneum 480 min (t4), the end of pneumoperitoneum (t5), and 24 h after surgery, jugular venous blood was drawn respectively for the measurement of Abeta by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Twenty-one cases of the fifty patients suffered from POCD after operation. We found that the maximum percentage drop in rSO2 (rSO(2, %max)) was significantly higher in the POCD group than in the non-POCD group. The rSO(2, %max) value of over 10.2% might be a potential predictor of neurocognitive injury for those patients. In the POCD group, the plasma Abeta levels after 24 h were significantly higher than those of pre-operative values (P<0.01). After 24 h, levels of plasma Abeta in the POCD group were significantly higher than those in the non-POCD group (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The development of POCD in patients undergoing laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy is associated with alterations of rSO2 and Abeta. Monitoring of rSO2 might be useful in the prediction of POCD, and Abeta might be used as a sensitive biochemical marker to predict the occurrence of POCD.

25294384|t|Single-molecule imaging reveals that small amyloid-beta1-42 oligomers interact with the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)).
25294384|a|Oligomers of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) play a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and have been suggested to induce neurotoxicity by binding to a plethora of cell-surface receptors. However, the heterogeneous mixtures of oligomers of varying sizes and conformations formed by Abeta42 have obscured the nature of the oligomeric species that bind to a given receptor. Here, we have used single-molecule imaging to characterize Abeta42 oligomers (oAbeta42) and to confirm the controversial interaction of oAbeta42 with the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) on live neuronal cells. Our results show that, at nanomolar concentrations, oAbeta42 interacts with PrP(C) and that the species bound to PrP(C) are predominantly small oligomers (dimers and trimers). Single-molecule biophysical studies can thus aid in deciphering the mechanisms that underlie receptor-mediated oAbeta-induced neurotoxicity, and ultimately facilitate the discovery of novel inhibitors of these pathways.

25295856|t|Antioxidant activity, delayed aging, and reduced amyloid-beta toxicity of methanol extracts of tea seed pomace from Camellia tenuifolia.
25295856|a|There is a growing interest in the exploitation of the residues generated by plants. This study explored the potential beneficial health effects from the main biowaste, tea seed pomace, produced when tea seed is processed. DPPH radical scavenging and total phenolic content assays were performed to evaluate the in vitro activities of the extracts. Caenorhabditis elegans was used as in vivo model to evaluate the beneficial health effects, including antioxidant activity, delayed aging, and reduced amyloid-beta toxicity. Among all soluble fractions obtained from the extracts of tea seed pomace from Camellia tenuifolia, the methanol (MeOH)-soluble fraction has the best in vivo antioxidant activities. The MeOH-soluble extraction was further divided into six fractions by chromatography with a Diaion HP-20 column eluted with water/MeOH, and fraction 3 showed the best in vitro and in vivo antioxidant activities. Further analysis in C. elegans showed that the MeOH extract (fraction 3) of tea seed pomace significantly decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species, prolonged C. elegans lifespan, and reduced amyloid-beta (Abeta) toxicity in transgenic C. elegans expressing human Abeta. Moreover, bioactivity-guided fractionation yielded two potent constituents from fraction 3 of the MeOH extract, namely, kaempferol 3-O-(2''-glucopyranosyl)-rutinoside and kaempferol 3-O-(2''-xylopyranosyl)-rutinoside, and both compounds exhibited excellent in vivo antioxidant activity. Taken together, MeOH extracts of tea seed pomace from C. tenuifolia have multiple beneficial health effects, suggesting that biowaste might be valuable to be explored for further development as nutraceutical products. Furthermore, the reuse of agricultural byproduct tea seed pomace also fulfills the environmental perspective.

25296312|t|Beta-amyloid oligomers activate apoptotic BAK pore for cytochrome c release.
25296312|a|In Alzheimer's disease, cytochrome c-dependent apoptosis is a crucial pathway in neuronal cell death. Although beta-amyloid (Abeta) oligomers are known to be the neurotoxins responsible for neuronal cell death, the underlying mechanisms remain largely elusive. Here, we report that the oligomeric form of synthetic Abeta of 42 amino acids elicits death of HT-22 cells. But, when expression of a bcl-2 family protein BAK is suppressed by siRNA, Abeta oligomer-induced cell death was reduced. Furthermore, significant reduction of cytochrome c release was observed with mitochondria isolated from BAK siRNA-treated HT-22 cells. Our in vitro experiments demonstrate that Abeta oligomers bind to BAK on the membrane and induce apoptotic BAK pores and cytochrome c release. Thus, the results suggest that Abeta oligomers function as apoptotic ligands and hijack the intrinsic apoptotic pathway to cause unintended neuronal cell death.

25296496|t|Amyloid beta lowering and cognition enhancing effects of ghrelin receptor analog [D-Lys (3)] GHRP-6 in rat model of obesity.
25296496|a|Obesity arising due to the dietary and life style changes is fast reaching epidemic proportions all over the world. There is increasing evidence that the incidence of Alzheimer disease (AD) is significantly influenced by a cluster of metabolic diseases, including diabetes and obesity. This study was aimed to test the suitability of experimentally-induced obesity in rats as an experimental animal model of AD. We used the procedure of neonatal administration of rats with monosodium L-glutamate (MSG), which generates adult obese animals as our study design and assessed the AD-like changes by measuring amyloid beta (1-42) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) levels in the hippocampal extracts and cognitive impairments by Barnes maze task. Further, we investigated the influence of anti-obesity substance [D-Lys (3)] GHRP-6 on blood glucose, hippocampal Abeta, AChE levels and restoration of cognitive deficits. Results revealed that administration of MSG to neonatal rats exhibited increased body mass index and serum glucose levels over the controls. Measurement of markers for AD-like molecular changes i.e. amyloid beta (Abeta) and AChE levels showed marked elevation in these two parameters in the hippocampus of MSG-treated rats. Assessment of cognitive abilities by Barnes maze revealed spatial disorientation characteristic of AD. Administration of ghrelin receptor analog [D-Lys (3)] GHRP-6 to obese rats resulted in significant restoration of serum cholesterol, glucose, leptin and ghrelin levels to that of control with concomitant reduction in hippocampal Abeta and AChE levels. In addition, the treated animals exhibited marked improvement in Barne's maze task. These findings suggest that MSG-induced obese rats may serve as non-transgenic animal model for AD research. Further, the results indicate the potential of [D-Lys (3)] GHRP-6 as a promising anti-Alzheimer candidate.

25297090|t|Abeta selectively impairs mGluR7 modulation of NMDA signaling in basal forebrain cholinergic neurons: implication in Alzheimer's disease.
25297090|a|Degeneration of basal forebrain (BF) cholinergic neurons is one of the early pathological events in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is thought to be responsible for the cholinergic and cognitive deficits in AD. The functions of this group of neurons are highly influenced by glutamatergic inputs from neocortex. We found that activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 7 (mGluR7) decreased NMDAR-mediated currents and NR1 surface expression in rodent BF neurons via a mechanism involving cofilin-regulated actin dynamics. In BF cholinergic neurons, beta-amyloid (Abeta) selectively impaired mGluR7 regulation of NMDARs by increasing p21-activated kinase activity and decreasing cofilin-mediated actin depolymerization through a p75(NTR)-dependent mechanism. Cell viability assays showed that activation of mGluR7 protected BF neurons from NMDA-induced excitotoxicity, which was selectively impaired by Abeta in BF cholinergic neurons. It provides a potential basis for the Abeta-induced disruption of calcium homeostasis that might contribute to the selective degeneration of BF cholinergic neurons in the early stage of AD.

25297091|t|Alzheimer's disease-like pathology induced by amyloid-beta oligomers in nonhuman primates.
25297091|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder and a major medical problem. Here, we have investigated the impact of amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers, AD-related neurotoxins, in the brains of rats and adult nonhuman primates (cynomolgus macaques). Soluble Abeta oligomers are known to accumulate in the brains of AD patients and correlate with disease-associated cognitive dysfunction. When injected into the lateral ventricle of rats and macaques, Abeta oligomers diffused into the brain and accumulated in several regions associated with memory and cognitive functions. Cardinal features of AD pathology, including synapse loss, tau hyperphosphorylation, astrocyte and microglial activation, were observed in regions of the macaque brain where Abeta oligomers were abundantly detected. Most importantly, oligomer injections induced AD-type neurofibrillary tangle formation in the macaque brain. These outcomes were specifically associated with Abeta oligomers, as fibrillar amyloid deposits were not detected in oligomer-injected brains. Human and macaque brains share significant similarities in terms of overall architecture and functional networks. Thus, generation of a macaque model of AD that links Abeta oligomers to tau and synaptic pathology has the potential to greatly advance our understanding of mechanisms centrally implicated in AD pathogenesis. Furthermore, development of disease-modifying therapeutics for AD has been hampered by the difficulty in translating therapies that work in rodents to humans. This new approach may be a highly relevant nonhuman primate model for testing therapeutic interventions for AD.

25297917|t|Interaction of Abeta(25-35) fibrillation products with mitochondria: Effect of small-molecule natural products.
25297917|a|The 25-35 fragment of the amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide is a naturally occurring proteolytic by-product that retains the pathophysiology of its larger parent molecule, whose deposition has been shown to involve mitochondrial dysfunction. Hence, disruption of Abeta(25-35) aggregates could afford an effective remedial strategy for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, the effect of a number of selected small-molecule natural products (polyphenols: resveratrol, quercetin, biochanin A, and indoles: indole-3-acetic acid, indole-3-carbinol (I3C)) on Abeta(25-35) fibrillogenesis was explored under physiological conditions, and interaction of the resulting structures with rat brain mitochondria was investigated. Several techniques, including fluorescence, circular dichroism, and transmission electron microscopy were utilized to characterize the aggregation products, and possible mitochondrial membrane permeabilization was determined following release of marker enzymes. Results demonstrate the capacity of Abeta(25-35) fibrils to damage mitochondria and suggest how small molecules may afford protection. While I3C appeared more effective in inhibiting the fibrillation process, all natural products behaved similarly in destabilizing preformed aggregates. It is concluded that elucidation of such protection may provide important insights into the development of preventive and therapeutic agents for AD.

25298312|t|Physical activity attenuates age-related biomarker alterations in preclinical AD.
25298312|a|OBJECTIVE: To examine whether engagement in physical activity might favorably alter the age-dependent evolution of Alzheimer disease (AD)-related brain and cognitive changes in a cohort of at-risk, late-middle-aged adults. METHODS: Three hundred seventeen enrollees in the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention underwent T1 MRI; a subset also underwent (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B-PET (n = 186) and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET (n = 152) imaging. Participants' responses on a self-report measure of current physical activity were used to classify them as either physically active or physically inactive based on American Heart Association guidelines. They also completed a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. Covariate-adjusted regression analyses were used to test whether the adverse effect of age on imaging and cognitive biomarkers was modified by physical activity. RESULTS: There were significant age x physical activity interactions for beta-amyloid burden (p = 0.014), glucose metabolism (p = 0.015), and hippocampal volume (p = 0.025) such that, with advancing age, physically active individuals exhibited a lesser degree of biomarker alterations compared with the physically inactive. Similar age x physical activity interactions were also observed on cognitive domains of Immediate Memory (p = 0.042) and Visuospatial Ability (p = 0.016). In addition, the physically active group had higher scores on Speed and Flexibility (p = 0.002) compared with the inactive group. CONCLUSIONS: In a middle-aged, at-risk cohort, a physically active lifestyle is associated with an attenuation of the deleterious influence of age on key biomarkers of AD pathophysiology. However, because our observational, cross-sectional design cannot establish causality, randomized controlled trials/longitudinal studies will be necessary for determining whether midlife participation in structured physical exercise forestalls the development of AD and related disorders in later life.

25300441|t|Impact of acamprosate on plasma amyloid-beta precursor protein in youth: a pilot analysis in fragile X syndrome-associated and idiopathic autism spectrum disorder suggests a pharmacodynamic protein marker.
25300441|a|BACKGROUND: Understanding of the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remains limited. Brain overgrowth has been hypothesized to be associated with the development of ASD. A derivative of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP), secreted APPalpha (sAPPalpha), has neuroproliferative effects and has been shown to be elevated in the plasma of persons with ASD compared to control subjects. Reduction in sAPPalpha holds promise as a novel molecular target of treatment in ASD. Research into the neurochemistry of ASD has repeatedly implicated excessive glutamatergic and deficient GABAergic neurotransmission in the disorder. With this in mind, acamprosate, a novel modulator of glutamate and GABA function, has been studied in ASD. No data is available on the impact of glutamate or GABA modulation on sAPPalpha function. METHODS: Plasma APP derivative levels pre- and post-treatment with acamprosate were determined in two pilot studies involving youth with idiopathic and fragile X syndrome (FXS)-associated ASD. We additionally compared baseline APP derivative levels between youth with FXS-associated or idiopathic ASD. RESULTS: Acamprosate use was associated with a significant reduction in plasma sAPP(total) and sAPPalpha levels but no change occurred in Abeta40 or Abeta42 levels in 15 youth with ASD (mean age: 11.1 years). Youth with FXS-associated ASD (n = 12) showed increased sAPPalpha processing compared to age-, gender- and IQ-match youth with idiopathic ASD (n = 11). CONCLUSIONS: Plasma APP derivative analysis holds promise as a potential biomarker for use in ASD targeted treatment. Reduction in sAPP (total) and sAPPalpha may be a novel pharmacodynamic property of acamprosate. Future study is required to address limitations of the current study to determine if baseline APP derivative analysis may predict subgroups of persons with idiopathic or FXS-associated ASD who may respond best to acamprosate or to potentially other modulators of glutamate and/or GABA neurotransmission.

25301235|t|The effects of Betula platyphylla bark on amyloid beta-induced learning and memory impairment in mice.
25301235|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is closely associated with amyloid beta (Abeta)-induced neurotoxicity and oxidative stress in the brain. Betula platyphylla, which has been used to treat various oxidative-stressed related diseases, has recently received attention for its preventive activity on age-related neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we attempted to investigate the effects of B. platyphylla bark (BPB-316) on Abeta(1-42)-induced neurotoxicity and memory impairment. Oral treatment using BPB-316 significantly attenuated Abeta-induced memory impairment which was evaluated by behavioral tests including the passive avoidance, Y-maze and Morris water maze test. BPB-316 also inhibited the elevation of beta-secretase activity accompanying the reduced Abeta(1-42) levels in the hippocampus of the brain. Furthermore, BPB-316 significantly decreased the acetylcholinesterase activity and increased the glutathione content in the hippocampus. In addition, we confirmed that the expression of both cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus of Abeta(1-42)-injected mice were markedly upregulated by the treatment of BPB-316. Our data suggest that the extracts of B. platyphylla bark might be a potential therapeutic agent against AD.

25301682|t|Longitudinal plasma amyloid beta in Alzheimer's disease clinical trials.
25301682|a|INTRODUCTION: Little is known about the utility of plasma amyloid beta (Abeta) in clinical trials of Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: We analyzed longitudinal plasma samples from two large multicenter clinical trials: (1) donezepil and vitamin E in mild cognitive impairment (n = 405, 24 months) and (2) simvastatin in mild to moderate AD (n = 225, 18 months). RESULTS: Baseline plasma Abeta was not related to cognitive or clinical progression. We observed a decrease in plasma Abeta40 and 42 among apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 (APOE epsilon4) carriers relative to noncarriers in the mild cognitive impairment trial. Patients treated with simvastatin showed a significant increase in Abeta compared with placebo. We found significant storage time effects and considerable plate-to-plate variation. DISCUSSION: We found no support for the utility of plasma Abeta as a prognostic factor or correlate of cognitive change. Analysis of stored specimens requires careful standardization and experimental design, but plasma Abeta may prove useful in pharmacodynamic studies of antiamyloid drugs.

25303711|t|Combining an amyloid-beta (Abeta) cleaving enzyme inhibitor with a gamma-secretase modulator results in an additive reduction of Abeta production.
25303711|a|A major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides in amyloid plaques. Abeta peptides are produced by sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein by the beta amyloid cleaving enzyme (BACE) and the gamma-secretase (gamma-sec) complex. Pharmacological treatments that decrease brain levels of in particular the toxic Abeta42 peptide are thought to be promising approaches for AD disease modification. Potent and selective BACE1 inhibitors as well as gamma-sec modulators (GSMs) have been designed. Pharmacological intervention of secretase function is not without risks of either on- or off-target adverse effects. One way of improving the therapeutic window could be to combine treatment on multiple targets, using smaller individual doses and thereby minimizing adverse effect liability. We show that combined treatment of primary cortical neurons with a BACE1 inhibitor and a GSM gives an additive effect on Abeta42 level change compared with the individual treatments. We extend this finding to C57BL/6 mice, where the combined treatment results in reduction of brain Abeta42 levels reflecting the sum of the individual treatment efficacies. These results show that pharmacological targeting of two amyloid precursor protein processing steps is feasible without negatively interfering with the mechanism of action on individual targets. We conclude that targeting Abeta production by combining a BACE inhibitor and a GSM could be a viable approach for therapeutic intervention in AD modification.

25305156|t|Amyloid, neurodegeneration, and small vessel disease as predictors of dementia in the oldest-old.
25305156|a|OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between brain structural changes and beta-amyloid deposition, and incident dementia in 183 elderly subjects without dementia (mean age 85.5 years) 2 years later. METHODS: Subjects had a brain structural MRI scan and a PET scan with (11)C-labeled Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) in 2009, and were evaluated clinically in 2011. RESULTS: At baseline evaluation, of the 183 participants (146 cognitively normal [CN]); 37 mild cognitive impairment [MCI]), 139 (76%) were PiB+, had small hippocampal volume (<25th percentile), or had high white matter lesion (WML) volume (>75th percentile). Two years later, 111 (61%) were classified as CN, 51 (28%) as MCI, and 21 (11%) as dementia. At baseline, 51% of the CN participants and 67.5% of the MCI cases were PiB+. Thirty percent of the CN and 51% of the MCI cases had small hippocampi, and 24% of the CN and 40.5% of the MCI cases had abnormal WMLs. Of the 21 participants who progressed to dementia, 20 (95%) had at least one imaging abnormality. Only 3 (14%) were only PiB+, 1 (5%) had only small hippocampi, 1 (5%) had only WMLs, 1 (5%) was biomarker negative, and the other 16 had various pairs of imaging abnormalities. Continuous variables of PiB retention, left and right hippocampal volume, and WML volume were independent predictors of dementia in a logistic regression analysis controlling for age, sex, education level, and Mini-Mental State Examination scores. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of beta-amyloid deposition, neurodegeneration (i.e., hippocampal atrophy), and small vessel disease (WMLs) is high in CN older individuals and in MCI. A combination of 2 or 3 of these factors is a powerful predictor of short-term incidence of dementia.

25305487|t|The E1 copper binding domain of full-length amyloid precursor protein mitigates copper-induced growth inhibition in brain metastatic prostate cancer DU145 cells.
25305487|a|Copper plays an important role in the aetiology and growth of tumours and levels of the metal are increased in the serum and tumour tissue of patients affected by a range of cancers including prostate cancer (PCa). The molecular mechanisms that enable cancer cells to proliferate in the presence of elevated copper levels are, therefore, of key importance in our understanding of tumour growth progression. In the current study, we have examined the role played by the amyloid precursor protein (APP) in mitigating copper-induced growth inhibition of the PCa cell line, DU145. A range of APP molecular constructs were stably over-expressed in DU145 cells and their effects on cell proliferation in the presence of copper were monitored. Our results show that endogenous APP expression was induced by sub-toxic copper concentrations in DU145 cells and over-expression of the wild-type protein was able to mitigate copper-induced growth inhibition via a mechanism involving the cytosolic and E1 copper binding domains of the full-length protein. APP likely represents one of a range of copper binding proteins that PCa cells employ in order to ensure efficient proliferation despite elevated concentrations of the metal within the tumour microenvironment. Targeting the expression of such proteins may contribute to therapeutic strategies for the treatment of cancers.

25307057|t|A three-dimensional human neural cell culture model of Alzheimer's disease.
25307057|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, characterized by two pathological hallmarks: amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease posits that the excessive accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide leads to neurofibrillary tangles composed of aggregated hyperphosphorylated tau. However, to date, no single disease model has serially linked these two pathological events using human neuronal cells. Mouse models with familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mutations exhibit amyloid-beta-induced synaptic and memory deficits but they do not fully recapitulate other key pathological events of Alzheimer's disease, including distinct neurofibrillary tangle pathology. Human neurons derived from Alzheimer's disease patients have shown elevated levels of toxic amyloid-beta species and phosphorylated tau but did not demonstrate amyloid-beta plaques or neurofibrillary tangles. Here we report that FAD mutations in beta-amyloid precursor protein and presenilin 1 are able to induce robust extracellular deposition of amyloid-beta, including amyloid-beta plaques, in a human neural stem-cell-derived three-dimensional (3D) culture system. More importantly, the 3D-differentiated neuronal cells expressing FAD mutations exhibited high levels of detergent-resistant, silver-positive aggregates of phosphorylated tau in the soma and neurites, as well as filamentous tau, as detected by immunoelectron microscopy. Inhibition of amyloid-beta generation with beta- or gamma-secretase inhibitors not only decreased amyloid-beta pathology, but also attenuated tauopathy. We also found that glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) regulated amyloid-beta-mediated tau phosphorylation. We have successfully recapitulated amyloid-beta and tau pathology in a single 3D human neural cell culture system. Our unique strategy for recapitulating Alzheimer's disease pathology in a 3D neural cell culture model should also serve to facilitate the development of more precise human neural cell models of other neurodegenerative disorders.

25310376|t|Rapid, cell-free assay for membrane-active forms of amyloid-beta.
25310376|a|Small oligomers of amyloid beta (Abeta) are suspected to be the key to Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, identifying these toxic species in the background of other similar but nontoxic Abeta aggregates has remained a challenge. Recent studies indicate that Abeta undergoes a global structural transition in an early step of aggregation. This transition is marked by a strong increase in its affinity for cell membranes, which suggests that the resultant oligomers could be the key to Abeta toxicity. Here we use this increased membrane affinity to develop a rapid, quantitative, cell-free assay for these bioactive oligomers. It uses fluorescence correlation spectroscopy of fluorescently labeled Abeta and requires only 30 s of measurement time. We also describe a simpler (though less rapid) assay based on the same principles, which uses a dialysis step followed by conventional fluorescence spectroscopy. Our results potentially provide a much-needed high-throughput assay for AD drug development.

25310732|t|A critical analysis of the 'amyloid cascade hypothesis'.
25310732|a|The 'amyloid cascade hypothesis' (ACH) is the most influential model of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The hypothesis proposes that the deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) is the initial pathological event in AD, leading to the formation of extracellular senile plaques (SP), tau-immunoreactive neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), neuronal loss, and ultimately, clinical dementia. Ever since the formulation of the ACH, however, there have been questions regarding whether it completely describes AD pathogenesis. This review critically examines various aspects of the ACH including its origin and development, the role of amyloid precursor protein (APP), whether SP and NFT are related to the development of clinical dementia, whether Abeta and tau are 'reactive' proteins, and whether there is a pathogenic relationship between SP and NFT. The results of transgenic experiments and treatments for AD designed on the basis of the ACH are also reviewed. It was concluded: (1) Abeta and tau could be the products rather than the cause of neurodegeneration in AD, (2) it is doubtful whether there is a direct causal link between Abeta and tau, and (3) SP and NFT may not be directly related to the development of dementia, (4) transgenic models involving APP alone do not completely replicate AD pathology, and (5) treatments based on the ACH have been unsuccessful. Hence, a modification of the ACH is proposed which may provide a more complete explanation of the pathogenesis of AD.

25310739|t|Paeoniflorin attenuates Abeta25-35-induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells by preventing mitochondrial dysfunction.
25310739|a|The pathogenic mechanism of neurodegenerative brain disorder such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been still far from clearly understood. Previous research has identified that mitochondrial dysfunction induced by Abeta has been recognized as a hallmark in AD. Therefore, the effective agents targeting beta-amyloid (Abeta)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction may be useful for the treatment or prevention of AD. In the present study, the neuroprotective effect of paeoniflorin (PF), one monoterpene glycoside isolated from the Chinese herb Radix Paeoniae alba, on Abeta25-35-induced toxicity in PC12 cells was investigated for the first time. The results showed that PF could attenuate or restore the cell injury induced by Abeta25-35 in PC12 cells through preventing mitochondrial dysfunction, including decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, increased cytochrome c release as well as activity of caspase-3 and caspase-9. Therefore, our data provide the evidence that PF could protect PC12 cells against Abeta25-35-induced neurotoxicity and might be a potentially therapeutic approach for AD in the future.

25312211|t|Clearance of beta-amyloid in the brain.
25312211|a|Intravascular substances invade extracellular spaces in the brain via endothelial cells in the sites without bloodbrain barrier (BBB) and move not only in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) but also in the interstitial fluid (ISF) of brain parenchyma adjacent to non-BBB sites. It is likely that CSF drains directly into the blood via arachnoid villi and granulations and also to lymph nodes via subarachnoid spaces in the brain and nasal lymphatics, whereas ISF drains to cervical lymph nodes through pathways along vascular wall of capillaries and arteries. As the supposed pathways of fluids seem to be critical for the maintenance of normal brain function, it is reasonable to suspect that an obstacle to the passage of fluids through these pathways likely induces some kinds of brain dysfunction such as Alzheimer's disease. According to assumed pathways for the elimination of amyloid-beta (Abeta) from the brain, Abeta peptides produced mainly in neurons are degraded by peptidases, flow out of the brain parenchyma into the blood through efflux transporters located in cerebral vessels, drain through perivascular pathways into the cervical lymph nodes, or are taken up by some kinds of cells in the brain. As for the perivascular pathways, ISF including Abeta peptides diffuses in the extracellular spaces of the brain parenchyma, enters basement membranes of capillaries, passes into the tunica media of arteries, and drains out of the brain. In this review, these pathways for the clearance of fluids including Abeta from the brain into the blood are briefly reviewed and the relationship between dysfunction of these pathways and brain diseases is discussed.

25315814|a|Immunological responses may contribute to disease progression and clinical heterogeneity in neurodegenerative dementia, for example, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Recently, a rapidly progressive form of AD (rpAD) has been described. On neuropathological grounds classical AD and rpAD are not distinguishable at present. All those protein aggregopathies show a state of chronic inflammation with microglia activation and production of proinflammatory cytokines. In this context, it is hypothesized that the severity of the surrounding inflammation substantially contributes to disease progression and accelerated disease courses as seen in rpAD.

25316600|t|Dietary (-)-epicatechin as a potent inhibitor of betagamma-secretase amyloid precursor protein processing.
25316600|a|Flavonoids, a group of dietary polyphenols have been shown to possess cognitive health benefits. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that they could play a role in risk reduction in dementia. Amyloid precursor protein processing and the subsequent generation of amyloid beta (Abeta) are central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, as soluble, oligomeric Abeta is thought to be the toxic species driving disease progression. We undertook an in vitro screen to identify flavonoids with bioactivity at betagamma-mediated amyloid precursor protein processing, which lead to identification of a number of flavonoids bioactive at 100 nM. Because of known bioavailability, we investigated the catechin family further and identified epigallocatechin and (-)-epicatechin as potent (nanomolar) inhibitors of amyloidogenic processing. Supporting this finding, we have shown reduced Abeta pathology and Abeta levels following short term, a 21-day oral delivery of (-)-epicatechin in 7-month-old TASTPM mice. Further, in vitro mechanistic studies suggest this is likely because of indirect BACE1 inhibition. Taken together, our results suggest that orally delivered (-)-epicatechin may be a potential prophylactic for Alzheimer's disease.

25319692|t|Impact of RTN3 deficiency on expression of BACE1 and amyloid deposition.
25319692|a|Reticulon 3 (RTN3) has previously been shown to interact with BACE1 and negatively regulate BACE1 activity. To what extent RTN3 deficiency affects BACE1 activity is an intriguing question. In this study, we aimed to address this by generating RTN3-null mice. Mice with complete deficiency of RTN3 grow normally and have no obviously discernible phenotypes. Morphological analyses of RTN3-null mice showed no significant alterations in cellular structure, although RTN3 is recognized as a protein contributing to the shaping of tubular endoplasmic reticulum. Biochemical analysis revealed that RTN3 deficiency increased protein levels of BACE1. This elevation of BACE1 levels correlated with enhanced processing of amyloid precursor protein at the beta-secretase site. We also demonstrated that RTN3 deficiency in Alzheimer's mouse models facilitates amyloid deposition, further supporting an in vivo role of RTN3 in the regulation of BACE1 activity. Since it has been shown that RTN3 monomer is reduced in brains of Alzheimer's patients, our results suggest that long-lasting reduction of RTN3 levels has adverse effects on BACE1 activity and may contribute to Alzheimer's pathogenesis.

25319699|t|Multifunctional liposomes reduce brain beta-amyloid burden and ameliorate memory impairment in Alzheimer's disease mouse models.
25319699|a|Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the accumulation and deposition of plaques of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide in the brain. Given its pivotal role, new therapies targeting Abeta are in demand. We rationally designed liposomes targeting the brain and promoting the disaggregation of Abeta assemblies and evaluated their efficiency in reducing the Abeta burden in Alzheimer's disease mouse models. Liposomes were bifunctionalized with a peptide derived from the apolipoprotein-E receptor-binding domain for blood-brain barrier targeting and with phosphatidic acid for Abeta binding. Bifunctionalized liposomes display the unique ability to hinder the formation of, and disaggregate, Abeta assemblies in vitro (EM experiments). Administration of bifunctionalized liposomes to APP/presenilin 1 transgenic mice (aged 10 months) for 3 weeks (three injections per week) decreased total brain-insoluble Abeta1-42 (-33%), assessed by ELISA, and the number and total area of plaques (-34%) detected histologically. Also, brain Abeta oligomers were reduced (-70.5%), as assessed by SDS-PAGE. Plaque reduction was confirmed in APP23 transgenic mice (aged 15 months) either histologically or by PET imaging with [(11)C]Pittsburgh compound B (PIB). The reduction of brain Abeta was associated with its increase in liver (+18%) and spleen (+20%). Notably, the novel-object recognition test showed that the treatment ameliorated mouse impaired memory. Finally, liposomes reached the brain in an intact form, as determined by confocal microscopy experiments with fluorescently labeled liposomes. These data suggest that bifunctionalized liposomes destabilize brain Abeta aggregates and promote peptide removal across the blood-brain barrier and its peripheral clearance. This all-in-one multitask therapeutic device can be considered as a candidate for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

25320049|t|Complex disposition of methylthioninium redox forms determines efficacy in tau aggregation inhibitor therapy for Alzheimer's disease.
25320049|a|Methylthioninium (MT) is a tau aggregation inhibitor with therapeutic potential in Alzheimer's disease (AD). MT exists in equilibrium between reduced [leucomethylthioninium (LMT)] and oxidized (MT(+)) forms; as a chloride salt [methylthioninium chloride (MTC), "methylene blue"], it is stabilized in its MT(+) form. Although the results of a phase 2 study of MTC in 321 mild/moderate AD subjects identified a 138-mg MT/day dose as the minimum effective dose on cognitive and imaging end points, further clinical development of MT was delayed pending resolution of the unexpected lack of efficacy of the 228-mg MT/day dose. We hypothesized that the failure of dose response may depend on differences known at the time in dissolution in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids of the 100-mg MTC capsules used to deliver the 228-mg dose and reflect previously unsuspected differences in redox processing of MT at different levels in the gut. The synthesis of a novel chemical entity, LMTX (providing LMT in a stable anhydrous crystalline form), has enabled a systematic comparison of the pharmacokinetic properties of MTC and LMTX in preclinical and clinical studies. The quantity of MT released in water or gastric fluid within 60 minutes proved in retrospect to be an important determinant of clinical efficacy. A further factor was a dose-dependent limitation in the ability to absorb MT in the presence of food when delivered in the MT(+) form as MTC. A model is presented to account for the complexity of MT absorption, which may have relevance for other similar redox molecules.

25322206|t|Orexinergic system dysregulation, sleep impairment, and cognitive decline in Alzheimer disease.
25322206|a|IMPORTANCE: Nocturnal sleep disruption develops in Alzheimer disease (AD) owing to the derangement of the sleep-wake cycle regulation pathways. Orexin contributes to the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle by increasing arousal levels and maintaining wakefulness. OBJECTIVES: To study cerebrospinal fluid levels of orexin in patients with AD, to evaluate the relationship of orexin cerebrospinal fluid levels with the degree of dementia and the cerebrospinal fluid AD biomarkers (tau proteins and beta-amyloid 1-42), and to analyze potentially related sleep architecture changes measured by polysomnography. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a case-control study from August 1, 2012, through May 31, 2013. We included 48 drug-naive AD patients referred to the Neurological Clinic of the University Hospital of Rome Tor Vergata. Based on the Mini-Mental State Examination score, 21 patients were included in mild AD group (score, >=21), whereas 27 were included in the moderate to severe AD group (score, <21). The control group consisted of 29 nondemented participants of similar age and sex. EXPOSURE: Laboratory assessment of cerebrospinal fluid levels of orexin, tau proteins, and beta-amyloid 1-42 and polysomnographic assessment of sleep variables. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Levels of orexin, tau proteins, and beta-amyloid 1-42; macrostructural variables of nocturnal sleep (total sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep onset and rapid eye movement [REM] sleep latencies, non-REM and REM sleep stages, and wakefulness after sleep onset); and Mini-Mental State Examination scores. RESULTS: Patients with moderate to severe AD presented with higher mean (SD) orexin levels compared with controls (154.36 [28.16] vs 131.03 [26.55]; P < .01) and with more impaired nocturnal sleep with respect to controls and patients with mild AD. On the other hand, in the global AD group, orexin levels were positively correlated with total tau protein levels (r = 0.32; P = .03) and strictly related to sleep impairment. Finally, cognitive impairment, as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination, was correlated with sleep structure deterioration. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our results demonstrate that, in AD, increased cerebrospinal fluid orexin levels are related to a parallel sleep deterioration, which appears to be associated with cognitive decline. Therefore, the orexinergic system seems to be dysregulated in AD, and its output and function appear to be overexpressed along the progression of the neurodegenerative process. This overexpression may result from an imbalance of the neurotransmitter networks regulating the wake-sleep cycle toward the orexinergic system promoting wakefulness.

25326800|t|Cleavage of tau by asparagine endopeptidase mediates the neurofibrillary pathology in Alzheimer's disease.
25326800|a|Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), composed of truncated and hyperphosphorylated tau, are a common feature of numerous aging-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the molecular mechanisms mediating tau truncation and aggregation during aging remain elusive. Here we show that asparagine endopeptidase (AEP), a lysosomal cysteine proteinase, is activated during aging and proteolytically degrades tau, abolishes its microtubule assembly function, induces tau aggregation and triggers neurodegeneration. AEP is upregulated and active during aging and is activated in human AD brain and tau P301S-transgenic mice with synaptic pathology and behavioral impairments, leading to tau truncation in NFTs. Tau P301S-transgenic mice with deletion of the gene encoding AEP show substantially reduced tau hyperphosphorylation, less synapse loss and rescue of impaired hippocampal synaptic function and cognitive deficits. Mice infected with adeno-associated virus encoding an uncleavable tau mutant showed attenuated pathological and behavioral defects compared to mice injected with adeno-associated virus encoding tau P301S. Together, these observations indicate that AEP acts as a crucial mediator of tau-related clinical and neuropathological changes. Inhibition of AEP may be therapeutically useful for treating tau-mediated neurodegenerative diseases.

25329175|a|Unique tyrosine glycosylated amyloid-beta(1-15) glycopeptides were synthesized with well-defined stereochemistry at the glycosidic linkages. Aided by these glycopeptides and tandem mass spectrometry analysis, the naturally existing amyloid-beta glycopeptides, isolated from Alzheimer's disease patients, were determined to contain an alpha-linked N-acetyl galactosamine at the modified tyrosine 10 residue. Glycosylation can significantly impact the properties of amyloid-beta as the glycopeptide has much lower affinity for Cu(+) ions.

25330398|t|Mechanism of amyloid-beta fibril elongation.
25330398|a|Amyloid-beta is an intrinsically disordered protein that forms fibrils in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. To explore factors that affect the process of fibril growth, we computed the free energy associated with disordered amyloid-beta monomers being added to growing amyloid fibrils using extensive molecular dynamics simulations coupled with umbrella sampling. We find that the mechanisms of Abeta40 and Abeta42 fibril elongation have many features in common, including the formation of an obligate on-pathway beta-hairpin intermediate that hydrogen bonds to the fibril core. In addition, our data lead to new hypotheses for how fibrils may serve as secondary nucleation sites that can catalyze the formation of soluble oligomers, a finding in agreement with recent experimental observations. These data provide a detailed mechanistic description of amyloid-beta fibril elongation and a structural link between the disordered free monomer and the growth of amyloid fibrils and soluble oligomers.

25331240|t|Human pandemic influenza: an assessment of the knowledge, attitudes and prevention practices of doctors in a tertiary health facility in Southern Nigeria.
25331240|a|AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The study assessed the knowledge level of doctors, their preparedness to respond to pandemic influenza and the preventive practices employed by them. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional survey of doctors from a tertiary-referral teaching hospital in Benin City, Nigeria was conducted between August and October, 2011. Interviewer administered structured questionnaires were distributed to 240 doctors in different departments in the University of Benin Teaching Hospital. RESULTS: In the study, 15.4% of participants had poor knowledge, 60.4% of respondents had fair knowledge and 24.2% of respondents had a good knowledge about pandemic human influenza. An analysis of attitudes showed that 46.2% of doctors have poor attitudes to work and only 10% had good attitude to work in the event of a pandemic human influenza emergency. CONCLUSION: Doctors had basic knowledge about how the virus is transmitted, symptoms and mode of spread of the human influenza infection, and about the preventive measures that should be taken. Most respondents had a poor attitude to work and did not consider themselves competent enough for role specific responsibilities during a pandemic. Up-to-date information and in-service training of health personnel will strengthen national preparedness and will delay international spread of novel influenza viruses.

25331948|t|The spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) regulates Alzheimer amyloid-beta production and Tau hyperphosphorylation.
25331948|a|We have previously shown that the L-type calcium channel (LCC) antagonist nilvadipine reduces brain amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation by affecting both Abeta production and Abeta clearance across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Nilvadipine consists of a mixture of two enantiomers, (+)-nilvadipine and (-)-nilvadipine, in equal proportion. (+)-Nilvadipine is the active enantiomer responsible for the inhibition of LCC, whereas (-)-nilvadipine is considered inactive. Both nilvadipine enantiomers inhibit Abeta production and improve the clearance of Abeta across the BBB showing that these effects are not related to LCC inhibition. In addition, treatment of P301S mutant human Tau transgenic mice (transgenic Tau P301S) with (-)-nilvadipine reduces Tau hyperphosphorylation at several Alzheimer disease (AD) pertinent epitopes. A search for the mechanism of action of (-)-nilvadipine revealed that this compound inhibits the spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk). We further validated Syk as a target-regulating Abeta by showing that pharmacological inhibition of Syk or down-regulation of Syk expression reduces Abeta production and increases the clearance of Abeta across the BBB mimicking (-)-nilvadipine effects. Moreover, treatment of transgenic mice overexpressing Abeta and transgenic Tau P301S mice with a selective Syk inhibitor respectively decreased brain Abeta accumulation and Tau hyperphosphorylation at multiple AD relevant epitopes. We show that Syk inhibition induces an increased phosphorylation of the inhibitory Ser-9 residue of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta, a primary Tau kinase involved in Tau phosphorylation, by activating protein kinase A, providing a mechanism explaining the reduction of Tau phosphorylation at GSK3beta-dependent epitopes following Syk inhibition. Altogether our data highlight Syk as a promising target for preventing both Abeta accumulation and Tau hyperphosphorylation in AD.

25332198|t|Colivelin ameliorates amyloid beta peptide-induced impairments in spatial memory, synaptic plasticity, and calcium homeostasis in rats.
25332198|a|Amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) has been thought to be neurotoxic and responsible for the impairment of learning and memory in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Humanin (HN), a 24 amino acid polypeptide first identified from the unaffected occipital lobe of an AD patient, is believed to be neuroprotective against the AD-related neurotoxicity. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of Colivelin (CLN), a novel HN derivative, against Abeta by using behavioral test, in vivo electrophysiological recording, and intracellular calcium imaging. Our results showed that intrahippocampal injection of CLN (0.2 nmol) effectively prevented Abeta25-35 (4 nmol)-induced deficits in spatial learning and memory of rats in Morris water maze test; the suppression of in vivo hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP) by Abeta25-35 was nearly completely prevented by CLN; in addition, CLN pretreatment also effectively inhibited Abeta25-35-induced calcium overload in primary cultured hippocampal neurons. These results indicate that CLN has significant neuroprotective properties against Abeta, and CLN may holds great promise for the treatment and prevention of AD.

25332445|t|Alzheimer CSF biomarkers may be misleading in normal-pressure hydrocephalus.
25332445|a|OBJECTIVE: This article discusses why CSF biomarkers found in normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) can be misleading when distinguishing NPH from comorbid NPH with Alzheimer disease (AD). METHODS: We describe NPH CSF biomarkers and how shunt surgery can change them. We hypothesize the effects that hydrocephalus may play on interstitial fluid space and amyloid precursor protein (APP) fragment drainage into the CSF based on a recent report and how this may explain the misleading CSF NPH biomarker findings. RESULTS: In NPH, beta-amyloid protein 42 (Abeta42) is low (as in AD), but total tau (t-tau) and phospho-tau (p-tau) levels are normal, providing conflicting biomarker findings. Low Abeta42 supports an AD diagnosis but tau findings do not. Importantly, not only Abeta42, but all APP fragments and tau proteins are low in NPH CSF. Further, these proteins increase after shunting. An increase in interstitial space and APP fragment drainage into the CSF during sleep was reported recently. CONCLUSIONS: In the setting of hydrocephalus when the brain is compressed, a decrease in interstitial space and APP protein fragment drainage into the CSF may be impeded, resulting in low levels of all APP fragments and tau proteins, which has been reported. Shunting, which decompresses the brain, would create more room for the interstitial space to increase and protein waste fragments to drain into the CSF. In fact, CSF proteins increase after shunting. CSF biomarkers in pre-shunt NPH have low Abeta42 and tau protein levels, providing misleading information to distinguish NPH from comorbid NPH plus AD.

25336154|t|BRI2 ectodomain affects Abeta42 fibrillation and tau truncation in human neuroblastoma cells.
25336154|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is pathologically characterized by the presence of misfolded proteins such as amyloid beta (Abeta) in senile plaques, and hyperphosphorylated tau and truncated tau in neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). The BRI2 protein inhibits Abeta aggregation via its BRICHOS domain and regulates critical proteins involved in initiating the amyloid cascade, which has been hypothesized to be central in AD pathogenesis. We recently detected the deposition of BRI2 ectodomain associated with Abeta plaques and concomitant changes in its processing enzymes in early stages of AD. Here, we aimed to investigate the effects of recombinant BRI2 ectodomain (rBRI276-266) on Abeta aggregation and on important molecular pathways involved in early stages of AD, including the unfolded protein response (UPR), phosphorylation and truncation of tau, as well as apoptosis. We found that rBRI276-266 delays Abeta fibril formation, although less efficiently than the BRI2 BRICHOS domain (BRI2 residues 113-231). In human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, rBRI276-266 slightly decreased cell viability and increased up to two-fold the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and the subsequent activity of caspases 3 and 9, indicating activation of apoptosis. rBRI276-266 upregulated the chaperone BiP but did not modify the mRNA expression of other UPR markers (CHOP and Xbp-1). Strikingly, rBRI276-266 induced the activation of GSK3beta but not the phosphorylation of tau. However, exposure to rBRI276-266 significantly induced the truncation of tau, indicating that BRI2 ectodomain can contribute to NFT formation. Since BRI2 can also regulate the metabolism of Abeta, the current data suggests that BRI2 ectodomain is a potential nexus between Abeta, tau pathology and neurodegeneration.

25337989|t|Structure and biomedical applications of amyloid oligomer nanoparticles.
25337989|a|Amyloid oligomers are nonfibrillar polypeptide aggregates linked to diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Here we show that these aggregates possess a compact, quasi-crystalline architecture that presents significant nanoscale regularity. The amyloid oligomers are dynamic assemblies and are able to release their individual subunits. The small oligomeric size and spheroid shape confer diffusible characteristics, electrophoretic mobility, and the ability to enter hydrated gel matrices or cells. We finally showed that the amyloid oligomers can be labeled with both fluorescence agents and iron oxide nanoparticles and can target macrophage cells. Oligomer amyloids may provide a new biological nanomaterial for improved targeting, drug release, and medical imaging.

25339735|t|Regulation of presynaptic Ca2+, synaptic plasticity and contextual fear conditioning by a N-terminal beta-amyloid fragment.
25339735|a|Soluble beta-amyloid has been shown to regulate presynaptic Ca(2+) and synaptic plasticity. In particular, picomolar beta-amyloid was found to have an agonist-like action on presynaptic nicotinic receptors and to augment long-term potentiation (LTP) in a manner dependent upon nicotinic receptors. Here, we report that a functional N-terminal domain exists within beta-amyloid for its agonist-like activity. This sequence corresponds to a N-terminal fragment generated by the combined action of alpha- and beta-secretases, and resident carboxypeptidase. The N-terminal beta-amyloid fragment is present in the brains and CSF of healthy adults as well as in Alzheimer's patients. Unlike full-length beta-amyloid, the N-terminal beta-amyloid fragment is monomeric and nontoxic. In Ca(2+) imaging studies using a model reconstituted rodent neuroblastoma cell line and isolated mouse nerve terminals, the N-terminal beta-amyloid fragment proved to be highly potent and more effective than full-length beta-amyloid in its agonist-like action on nicotinic receptors. In addition, the N-terminal beta-amyloid fragment augmented theta burst-induced post-tetanic potentiation and LTP in mouse hippocampal slices. The N-terminal fragment also rescued LTP inhibited by elevated levels of full-length beta-amyloid. Contextual fear conditioning was also strongly augmented following bilateral injection of N-terminal beta-amyloid fragment into the dorsal hippocampi of intact mice. The fragment-induced augmentation of fear conditioning was attenuated by coadministration of nicotinic antagonist. The activity of the N-terminal beta-amyloid fragment appears to reside largely in a sequence surrounding a putative metal binding site, YEVHHQ. These findings suggest that the N-terminal beta-amyloid fragment may serve as a potent and effective endogenous neuromodulator.

25340798|t|Genome-wide association study of CSF levels of 59 alzheimer's disease candidate proteins: significant associations with proteins involved in amyloid processing and inflammation.
25340798|a|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 42 amino acid species of amyloid beta (Abeta42) and tau levels are strongly correlated with the presence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology including amyloid plaques and neurodegeneration and have been successfully used as endophenotypes for genetic studies of AD. Additional CSF analytes may also serve as useful endophenotypes that capture other aspects of AD pathophysiology. Here we have conducted a genome-wide association study of CSF levels of 59 AD-related analytes. All analytes were measured using the Rules Based Medicine Human DiscoveryMAP Panel, which includes analytes relevant to several disease-related processes. Data from two independently collected and measured datasets, the Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), were analyzed separately, and combined results were obtained using meta-analysis. We identified genetic associations with CSF levels of 5 proteins (Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4 (CCL4), Interleukin 6 receptor (IL6R) and Matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP3)) with study-wide significant p-values (p<1.46x10-10) and significant, consistent evidence for association in both the Knight ADRC and the ADNI samples. These proteins are involved in amyloid processing and pro-inflammatory signaling. SNPs associated with ACE, IL6R and MMP3 protein levels are located within the coding regions of the corresponding structural gene. The SNPs associated with CSF levels of CCL4 and CCL2 are located in known chemokine binding proteins. The genetic associations reported here are novel and suggest mechanisms for genetic control of CSF and plasma levels of these disease-related proteins. Significant SNPs in ACE and MMP3 also showed association with AD risk. Our findings suggest that these proteins/pathways may be valuable therapeutic targets for AD. Robust associations in cognitively normal individuals suggest that these SNPs also influence regulation of these proteins more generally and may therefore be relevant to other diseases.

25341459|t|2014 Report on the Milestones for the US National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.
25341459|a|With increasing numbers of people with Alzheimer's and other dementias across the globe, many countries have developed national plans to deal with the resulting challenges. In the United States, the National Alzheimer's Project Act, signed into law in 2011, required the creation of such a plan with annual updates thereafter. Pursuant to this, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease in 2012, including an ambitious research goal of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's disease by 2025. To guide investments, activities, and the measurement of progress toward achieving this 2025 goal, in its first annual plan update (2013) HHS also incorporated into the plan a set of short, medium and long-term milestones. HHS further committed to updating these milestones on an ongoing basis to account for progress and setbacks, and emerging opportunities and obstacles. To assist HHS as it updates these milestones, the Alzheimer's Association convened a National Plan Milestone Workgroup consisting of scientific experts representing all areas of Alzheimer's and dementia research. The workgroup evaluated each milestone and made recommendations to ensure that they collectively constitute an adequate work plan for reaching the goal of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's by 2025. This report presents these Workgroup recommendations.

25342129|t|Dysfunctionally phosphorylated type 1 insulin receptor substrate in neural-derived blood exosomes of preclinical Alzheimer's disease.
25342129|a|Insulin resistance causes diminished glucose uptake in similar regions of the brain in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). Brain tissue studies suggested that insulin resistance is caused by low insulin receptor signaling attributable to its abnormal association with more phospho (P)-serine-type 1 insulin receptor substrate (IRS-1) and less P-tyrosine-IRS-1. Plasma exosomes enriched for neural sources by immunoabsorption were obtained once from 26 patients with AD, 20 patients with DM2, 16 patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and matched case control subjects. At 2 time points, they were obtained from 22 others when cognitively normal and 1 to 10 yr later when diagnosed with AD. Mean exosomal levels of extracted P-serine 312-IRS-1 and P-pan-tyrosine-IRS-1 by ELISA and the ratio of P-serine 312-IRS-1 to P-pan-tyrosine-IRS-1 (insulin resistance factor, R) for AD and DM2 and P-serine 312-IRS-1 and R for FTD were significantly different from those for case control subjects. The levels of R for AD were significantly higher than those for DM2 or FTD. Stepwise discriminant modeling showed correct classification of 100% of patients with AD, 97.5% of patients with DM2, and 84% of patients with FTD. In longitudinal studies of 22 patients with AD, exosomal levels of P-serine 312-IRS-1, P-pan-tyrosine-IRS-1, and R were significantly different 1 to 10 yr before and at the time of diagnosis compared with control subjects. Insulin resistance reflected in R values from this blood test is higher for patients with AD, DM2, and FTD than case control subjects; higher for patients with AD than patients with DM2 or FTD; and accurately predicts development of AD up to 10 yr prior to clinical onset.

25342943|t|Calcium-Sensing Receptors of Human Astrocyte-Neuron Teams: Amyloid-beta-Driven Mediators and Therapeutic Targets of Alzheimer's Disease.
25342943|a|It is generally assumed that the neuropathology of sporadic (late-onset or nonfamilial) Alzheimer's disease (AD) is driven by the overproduction and spreading of first Amyloid-betax-42 (Abeta42) and later hyperphosphorylated (hp)-Tau oligomeric "infectious seeds". Hitherto, only neurons were held to make and spread both oligomer types; astrocytes would just remove debris. However, we have recently shown that exogenous fibrillar or soluble Abeta peptides specifically bind and activate the Ca(2+)-sensing receptors (CaSRs) of untransformed human cortical adult astrocytes and postnatal neurons cultured in vitro driving them to produce, accrue, and secrete surplus endogenous Abeta42. While the Abeta-exposed neurons start dying, astrocytes survive and keep oversecreting Abeta42, nitric oxide (NO), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A. Thus astrocytes help neurons' demise. Moreover, we have found that a highly selective allosteric CaSR agonist ("calcimimetic"), NPS R-568, mimics the just mentioned neurotoxic actions triggered by Abeta CaSR signaling. Contrariwise, and most important, NPS 2143, a highly selective allosteric CaSR antagonist ("calcilytic"), fully suppresses all the Abeta CaSR signaling-driven noxious actions. Altogether our findings suggest that the progression of AD neuropathology is promoted by unceasingly repeating cycles of accruing exogenous Abeta42 oligomers interacting with the CaSRs of swelling numbers of astrocyte-neuron teams thereby recruiting them to overrelease additional Abeta42 oligomers, VEGF-A, and NO. Calcilytics would beneficially break such Abeta/CaSR-driven vicious cycles and hence halt or at least slow the otherwise unstoppable spreading of AD neuropathology.

25343357|t|Elucidating molecular mass and shape of a neurotoxic Abeta oligomer.
25343357|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent type of dementia, has been associated with the accumulation of amyloid beta oligomers (AbetaOs) in the central nervous system. AbetaOs vary widely in size, ranging from dimers to larger than 100 kDa. Evidence indicates that not all oligomers are toxic, and there is yet no consensus on the size of the actual toxic oligomer. Here we used NU4, a conformation-dependent anti-AbetaO monoclonal antibody, to investigate size and shape of a toxic AbetaO assembly. By using size-exclusion chromatography and immuno-based detection, we isolated an AbetaO-NU4 complex amenable for biochemical and morphological studies. The apparent molecular mass of the NU4-targeted oligomer was 80 kDa. Atomic force microscopy imaging of the AbetaO-NU4 complex showed a size distribution centered at 5.37 nm, an increment of 1.5 nm compared to the size of AbetaOs (3.85 nm). This increment was compatible with the size of NU4 (1.3 nm), suggesting a 1:1 oligomer to NU4 ratio. NU4-reactive oligomers extracted from AD human brain concentrated in a molecular mass range similar to that found for in vitro prepared oligomers, supporting the relevance of the species herein studied. These results represent an important step toward understanding the connection between AbetaO size and toxicity.

25344383|t|Increased CSF APPs-alpha levels in patients with Alzheimer disease treated with acitretin.
25344383|a|OBJECTIVE: We investigated induction of alpha-secretase A disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10) by the synthetic retinoid acitretin (Neotigason; Actavis, Munchen-Riem, Germany) in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease (AD) via measurement of CSF content of alpha-secretase-derived amyloid precursor protein (APPs-alpha). METHODS: Twenty-one patients clinically diagnosed with mild to moderate AD received acitretin (30 mg per day) or placebo in a 4-week double-blind study. Primary endpoint was the difference of CSF APPs-alpha ratios calculated from the APPs-alpha levels after treatment and at baseline. We monitored safety and tolerability of the treatment. In addition, we assessed biomarkers such as beta-amyloid 42 (Abeta42) under treatment conditions. RESULTS: The acitretin group showed a significant increase in CSF APPs-alpha levels compared with the placebo group (difference 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.03-0.72, p = 0.035) within this rather short treatment period. The synthetic retinoid acitretin was overall safe and well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot study highlights that acitretin is able to enhance the nonamyloidogenic APP processing in human patients. Clinical consequences of this regulation should be investigated in larger and longer trials in patients with AD to evaluate acitretin's potential to serve as a novel therapeutic drug. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that in patients with AD, oral acitretin increases CSF APPs-alpha levels.

25347801|t|Effects of macromolecular crowding on amyloid beta (16-22) aggregation using coarse-grained simulations.
25347801|a|To examine the effect of crowding on protein aggregation, discontinuous molecular dynamics (DMD) simulations combined with an intermediate resolution protein model, PRIME20, were applied to a peptide/crowder system. The systems contained 192 Abeta(16-22) peptides and crowders of diameters 5, 20, and 40 A, represented here by simple hard spheres, at crowder volume fractions of 0.00, 0.10, and 0.20. Results show that both crowder volume fraction and crowder diameter have a large impact on fibril and oligomer formation. The addition of crowders to a system of peptides increases the rate of oligomer formation, shifting from a slow ordered formation of oligomers in the absence of crowders, similar to nucleated polymerization, to a fast collapse of peptides and subsequent rearrangement characteristic of nucleated conformational conversion with a high maximum in the number of peptides in oligomers as the total crowder surface area increases. The rate of conversion from oligomers to fibrils also increases with increasing total crowder surface area, giving rise to an increased rate of fibril growth. In all cases, larger volume fractions and smaller crowders provide the greatest aggregation enhancement effects. We also show that the size of the crowders influences the formation of specific oligomer sizes. In our simulations, the 40 A crowders enhance the number of dimers relative to the numbers of trimers, hexamers, pentamers, and hexamers, while the 5 A crowders enhance the number of hexamers relative to the numbers of dimers, trimers, tetramers, and pentamers.

25347820|a|8-beta-d-Glucopyranosylgenistein (1), the major component of Genista tenera, was synthesized and showed an extensive therapeutical impact in the treatment of STZ-induced diabetic rats, producing normalization of fasting hyperglycemia and amelioration of excessive postprandial glucose excursions and and increasing beta-cell sensitivity, insulin secretion, and circulating insulin within 7 days at a dose of 4 (mg/kg bw)/day. Suppression of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) fibril formation by compound 1 was demonstrated by thioflavin T fluorescence and atomic force microscopy. Molecular recognition studies with IAPP and Abeta1-42 employing saturation transfer difference (STD) confirmed the same binding mode for both amyloid peptides as suggested by their deduced epitope. Insights into the preferred conformation in the bound state and conformers' geometry resulting from interaction with Abeta1-42 were also given by STD, trNOESY, and MM calculations. These studies strongly support 8-beta-d-glucopyranosylgenistein as a promising molecular entity for intervention in amyloid events of both diabetes and the frequently associated Alzheimer's disease.

25348064|t|Primary age-related tauopathy (PART): a common pathology associated with human aging.
25348064|a|We recommend a new term, "primary age-related tauopathy" (PART), to describe a pathology that is commonly observed in the brains of aged individuals. Many autopsy studies have reported brains with neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that are indistinguishable from those of Alzheimer's disease (AD), in the absence of amyloid (Abeta) plaques. For these "NFT+/Abeta-" brains, for which formal criteria for AD neuropathologic changes are not met, the NFTs are mostly restricted to structures in the medial temporal lobe, basal forebrain, brainstem, and olfactory areas (bulb and cortex). Symptoms in persons with PART usually range from normal to amnestic cognitive changes, with only a minority exhibiting profound impairment. Because cognitive impairment is often mild, existing clinicopathologic designations, such as "tangle-only dementia" and "tangle-predominant senile dementia", are imprecise and not appropriate for most subjects. PART is almost universally detectable at autopsy among elderly individuals, yet this pathological process cannot be specifically identified pre-mortem at the present time. Improved biomarkers and tau imaging may enable diagnosis of PART in clinical settings in the future. Indeed, recent studies have identified a common biomarker profile consisting of temporal lobe atrophy and tauopathy without evidence of Abeta accumulation. For both researchers and clinicians, a revised nomenclature will raise awareness of this extremely common pathologic change while providing a conceptual foundation for future studies. Prior reports that have elucidated features of the pathologic entity we refer to as PART are discussed, and working neuropathological diagnostic criteria are proposed.

25349165|t|Evidence that small molecule enhancement of beta-hexosaminidase activity corrects the behavioral phenotype in Dutch APP(E693Q) mice through reduction of ganglioside-bound Abeta.
25349165|a|Certain mutant Alzheimer's amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides (that is, Dutch mutant APP(E693Q)) form complexes with gangliosides (GAbeta). These mutant Abeta peptides may also undergo accelerated aggregation and accumulation upon exposure to GM2 and GM3. We hypothesized that increasing beta-hexosaminidase (beta-hex) activity would lead to a reduction in GM2 levels, which in turn, would cause a reduction in Abeta aggregation and accumulation. The small molecule OT1001 is a beta-hex-targeted pharmacological chaperone with good bioavailability, blood-brain barrier penetration, high selectivity for beta-hex and low cytotoxicity. Dutch APP(E693Q) transgenic mice accumulate oligomeric Abeta as they age, as well as Abeta oligomer-dose-dependent anxiety and impaired novel object recognition (NOR). Treatment of Dutch APP(E693Q) mice with OT1001 caused a dose-dependent increase in brain beta-hex levels up to threefold over those observed at baseline. OT1001 treatment was associated with reduced anxiety, improved learning behavior in the NOR task and dramatically reduced GAbeta accumulation in the subiculum and perirhinal cortex, both of which are brain regions required for normal NOR. Pharmacological chaperones that increase beta-hex activity may be useful in reducing accumulation of certain mutant species of Abeta and in preventing the associated behavioral pathology.

25349172|t|Prognostic serum miRNA biomarkers associated with Alzheimer's disease shows concordance with neuropsychological and neuroimaging assessment.
25349172|a|There is no consensus for a blood-based test for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Expression profiling of small non-coding RNA's, microRNA (miRNA), has revealed diagnostic potential in human diseases. Circulating miRNA are found in small vesicles known as exosomes within biological fluids such as human serum. The aim of this work was to determine a set of differential exosomal miRNA biomarkers between healthy and AD patients, which may aid in diagnosis. Using next-generation deep sequencing, we profiled exosomal miRNA from serum (N=49) collected from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Flagship Study (AIBL). Sequencing results were validated using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR; N=60), with predictions performed using the Random Forest method. Additional risk factors collected during the 4.5-year AIBL Study including clinical, medical and cognitive assessments, and amyloid neuroimaging with positron emission tomography were assessed. An AD-specific 16-miRNA signature was selected and adding established risk factors including age, sex and apolipoprotein e4 (APOE e4) allele status to the panel of deregulated miRNA resulted in a sensitivity and specificity of 87% and 77%, respectively, for predicting AD. Furthermore, amyloid neuroimaging information for those healthy control subjects incorrectly classified with AD-suggested progression in these participants towards AD. These data suggest that an exosomal miRNA signature may have potential to be developed as a suitable peripheral screening tool for AD.

25349919|t|Preparation protocols of abeta(1-40) promote the formation of polymorphic aggregates and altered interactions with lipid bilayers.
25349919|a|The appearance of neuritic amyloid plaques comprised of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) in the brain is a predominant feature in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the aggregation process, Abeta samples a variety of potentially toxic aggregate species, ranging from small oligomers to fibrils. Abeta has the ability to form a variety of morphologically distinct and stable amyloid fibrils. Commonly termed polymorphs, such distinct aggregate species may play a role in variations of AD pathology. It has been well documented that polymorphic aggregates of Abeta can be produced by changes in the chemical environment and peptide preparations. As Abeta and several of its aggregated forms are known to interact directly with lipid membranes and this interaction may play a role in a variety of potential toxic mechanisms associated with AD, we determine how different Abeta(1-40) preparation protocols that lead to distinct polymorphic fibril aggregates influence the interaction of Abeta(1-40) with model lipid membranes. Using three distinct protocols for preparing Abeta(1-40), the aggregate species formed in the absence and presence of a lipid bilayers were investigated using a variety of scanning probe microscopy techniques. The three preparations of Abeta(1-40) promoted distinct oligomeric and fibrillar aggregates in the absence of bilayers that formed at different rates. Despite these differences in aggregation properties, all Abeta(1-40) preparations were able to disrupt supported total brain lipid extract bilayers, altering the bilayer's morphological and mechanical properties.

25350343|a|Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) aggregation is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and metal ions such as Cu(ii) have been proposed to play a role in amyloid formation and the onset of this progressive neurodegenerative disorder. This study reports the design and characterization of a novel bifunctional non-natural tetrapeptide, Met-Asp-d-Trp-Aib, that is capable of binding copper, competing with Abeta for Cu(ii), and modulating Abeta aggregation. The study of this tetrapeptide provides further insights into the role of Cu(ii) in the Abeta aggregation pathway, and into the design of compounds with therapeutic potential for Alzheimer's disease.

25350374|t|Independent relationship between amyloid precursor protein (APP) dimerization and gamma-secretase processivity.
25350374|a|Altered production of beta-amyloid (Abeta) from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is closely associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). APP has a number of homo- and hetero-dimerizing domains, and studies have suggested that dimerization of beta-secretase derived APP carboxyl terminal fragment (CTFbeta, C99) impairs processive cleavage by gamma-secretase increasing production of long Abetas (e.g., Abeta1-42, 43). Other studies report that APP CTFbeta dimers are not gamma-secretase substrates. We revisited this issue due to observations made with an artificial APP mutant referred to as 3xK-APP, which contains three lysine residues at the border of the APP ectodomain and transmembrane domain (TMD). This mutant, which dramatically increases production of long Abeta, was found to form SDS-stable APP dimers, once again suggesting a mechanistic link between dimerization and increased production of long Abeta. To further evaluate how multimerization of substrate affects both initial gamma-secretase cleavage and subsequent processivity, we generated recombinant wild type- (WT) and 3xK-C100 substrates, isolated monomeric, dimeric and trimeric forms of these proteins, and evaluated both epsilon-cleavage site utilization and Abeta production. These show that multimerization significantly impedes gamma-secretase cleavage, irrespective of substrate sequence. Further, the monomeric form of the 3xK-C100 mutant increased long Abeta production without altering the initial epsilon-cleavage utilization. These data confirm and extend previous studies showing that dimeric substrates are not efficient gamma-secretase substrates, and demonstrate that primary sequence determinants within APP substrate alter gamma-secretase processivity.

25352592|t|A synthetic antibody fragment targeting nicastrin affects assembly and trafficking of gamma-secretase.
25352592|a|The gamma-secretase complex, composed of presenilin, nicastrin (NCT), anterior pharynx-defective 1 (APH-1), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN-2), is assembled in a highly regulated manner and catalyzes the intramembranous proteolysis of many type I membrane proteins, including Notch and amyloid precursor protein. The Notch family of receptors plays important roles in cell fate specification during development and in adult tissues, and aberrant hyperactive Notch signaling causes some forms of cancer. gamma-Secretase-mediated processing of Notch at the cell surface results in the generation of the Notch intracellular domain, which associates with several transcriptional coactivators involved in nuclear signaling events. On the other hand, gamma-secretase-mediated processing of amyloid precursor protein leads to the production of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides that play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. We used a phage display approach to identify synthetic antibodies that specifically target NCT and expressed them in the single-chain variable fragment (scFv) format in mammalian cells. We show that expression of a NCT-specific scFv clone, G9, in HEK293 cells decreased the production of the Notch intracellular domain but not the production of amyloid beta peptides that occurs in endosomal and recycling compartments. Biochemical studies revealed that scFvG9 impairs the maturation of NCT by associating with immature forms of NCT and, consequently, prevents its association with the other components of the gamma-secretase complex, leading to degradation of these molecules. The reduced cell surface levels of mature gamma-secretase complexes, in turn, compromise the intramembranous processing of Notch.

25354367|t|Hyperspectral imaging signatures detect amyloidopathy in Alzheimer's mouse retina well before onset of cognitive decline.
25354367|a|Amyloidopathic disorders such as Alzheimer's disease present symptomology years after the entrenchment of amyloidogenic imbalance. The pathologic alpha-helix   beta-strand conversion of amyloid beta(1-42) and amyloid beta(1-40) peptides causes neuronal death in the vicinity. Symptomology often presents only after significant neurodegeneration. This thus warrants early detection of amyloidopathy in Alzheimer's disease. Nonexistent modalities for direct identification and quantitation of soluble amyloid aggregates or (proto)fibrils forced us to undertake the development of a spectrophotometric technique to support ongoing drug design. Key requirements were independence from the need for extraneous staining, unambiguous amyloid aggregate detection, and minimal influence of interpretative errors. A Cytoviva instrument pivotal to this study captures scattering of light of visible-near-infrared (VNIR, 400-1000 nm) wavelengths within each pixel of the microscopic view field. We thus assembled a scattering intensity pattern database that provided "signatures" of amyloid aggregates. Comparison of unknown samples against this database enabled direct detection of amyloid aggregates. The technique was found useful for monitoring retinal and brain amyloidopathy in an ongoing preclinical anti-AD study, attesting to the technique's sensitivity and specificity. Interestingly, the technique was found applicable not just to excised brain tissue but also to isolated mouse retina. With the retina being heralded widely as a (diagnostic) extension of the CNS and retinal amyloidopathy occurring well before that in the brain, this development raises a possibility for the first direct retinal imaging diagnosis of early asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease.

In the genome of the demosponge Amphimedon queenslandica, no Hox or ParaHox genes are present, but NK genes are linked in a tight cluster similar to the NK clusters of bilaterians. It has been proposed that Hox and ParaHox genes originated from NK cluster genes after divergence of sponges from the lineage leading to cnidarians and bilaterians. On the other hand, synteny analysis lends support to the notion that the absence of Hox and ParaHox genes in Amphimedon is a result of secondary loss (the ghost locus hypothesis). Here we analysed complete suites of ANTP-class homeoboxes in two calcareous sponges, Sycon ciliatum and Leucosolenia complicata. Our phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that these calcisponges possess orthologues of bilaterian NK genes (Hex, Hmx and Msx), a varying number of additional NK genes and one ParaHox gene, Cdx. Despite the generation of scaffolds spanning multiple genes, we find no evidence of clustering of Sycon NK genes. All Sycon ANTP-class genes are developmentally expressed, with patterns suggesting their involvement in cell type specification in embryos and adults, metamorphosis and body plan patterning. These results demonstrate that ParaHox genes predate the origin of sponges, thus confirming the ghost locus hypothesis, and highlight the need to analyse the genomes of multiple sponge lineages to obtain a complete picture of the ancestral composition of the first animal genome.

25355827|t|Plasma beta-amyloid and MRI markers of cerebral small vessel disease: Three-City Dijon study.
25355827|a|OBJECTIVE: We investigated the relation of circulating plasma beta-amyloid (Abeta) with MRI markers of small vessel disease (SVD) in dementia-free community persons. METHODS: Participants were 1,690 individuals aged 65 to 80 years from the Three-City Dijon Study. Plasma Abeta measurement and MRI examination were performed at baseline and after a 4-year follow-up. MRI markers of SVD included white matter hyperintensities (WMH), lacunes, and enlarged perivascular spaces. We examined the relation of plasma Abeta levels with MRI markers of SVD at baseline and with progression of WMH over follow-up (n = 1,057). We also assessed whether these relations were modified by vascular risk factors, notably blood pressure. RESULTS: Low plasma Abeta1-40 levels were associated with increased progression of WMH, and low Abeta1-42 with higher odds of extensive WMH progression over the follow-up (odds ratio = 1.66, 95% confidence interval = 1.16-2.38). Consistently low Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 levels on both measurements were associated with accelerated progression of WMH. These associations were modified by blood pressure levels but not the APOE epsilon4 genotype. CONCLUSIONS: Progression of WMH volume in dementia-free older persons is associated with levels of circulating plasma Abeta. These results reinforce the notion of an interrelation of vascular and neurodegenerative mechanisms in cerebral aging.

25356301|t|An evidence-based unified definition of lifelong and acquired premature ejaculation: report of the second international society for sexual medicine ad hoc committee for the definition of premature ejaculation.
25356301|a|INTRODUCTION: The International Society for Sexual Medicine (ISSM) Ad Hoc Committee for the Definition of Premature Ejaculation developed the first evidence-based definition for lifelong premature ejaculation (PE) in 2007 and concluded that there were insufficient published objective data at that time to develop a definition for acquired PE. AIM: The aim of this article is to review and critique the current literature and develop a contemporary, evidence-based definition for acquired PE and/or a unified definition for both lifelong and acquired PE. METHODS: In April 2013, the ISSM convened a second Ad Hoc Committee for the Definition of Premature Ejaculation in Bangalore, India. The same evidence-based systematic approach to literature search, retrieval, and evaluation used by the original committee was adopted. RESULTS: The committee unanimously agreed that men with lifelong and acquired PE appear to share the dimensions of short ejaculatory latency, reduced or absent perceived ejaculatory control, and the presence of negative personal consequences. Men with acquired PE are older, have higher incidences of erectile dysfunction, comorbid disease, and cardiovascular risk factors, and have a longer intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT) as compared with men with lifelong PE. A self-estimated or stopwatch IELT of 3 minutes was identified as a valid IELT cut-off for diagnosing acquired PE. On this basis, the committee agreed on a unified definition of both acquired and lifelong PE as a male sexual dysfunction characterized by (i) ejaculation that always or nearly always occurs prior to or within about 1 minute of vaginal penetration from the first sexual experience (lifelong PE) or a clinically significant and bothersome reduction in latency time, often to about 3 minutes or less (acquired PE); (ii) the inability to delay ejaculation on all or nearly all vaginal penetrations; and (iii) negative personal consequences, such as distress, bother, frustration, and/or the avoidance of sexual intimacy. CONCLUSION: The ISSM unified definition of lifelong and acquired PE represents the first evidence-based definition for these conditions. This definition will enable researchers to design methodologically rigorous studies to improve our understanding of acquired PE.

25356391|t|Hypertension drives parenchymal beta-amyloid accumulation in the brain parenchyma.
25356391|a|There is substantial controversy regarding the causative role of amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The cerebrovasculature plays an important role in the elimination of Abeta from the brain and hypertension is a well-known risk factor for AD. In spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats (SHRSP), an animal model of chronic arterial hypertension, cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) leads to age-dependent parenchymal Abeta accumulation similar to that observed in AD. These data approve the neuropathological link between CSVD and AD, confirm the challenge that parenchymal Abeta deposition is a specific marker for AD and disclose the meaning of SHRSP as valid experimental model to investigate the association between hypertension, CSVD, and Abeta plaques.

25356424|t|Phosphodiesterase III inhibitor promotes drainage of cerebrovascular beta-amyloid.
25356424|a|OBJECTIVE: Brain amyloidosis is a key feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It also incorporates cerebrovascular amyloid beta (Abeta) in the form of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) involving neurovascular dysfunction. We have recently shown by retrospective analysis that patients with mild cognitive impairment receiving a vasoactive drug cilostazol, a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase (PDE) III, exhibit significantly reduced cognitive decline. Here, we tested whether cilostazol protects against the disruption of the neurovascular unit and facilitates the arterial pulsation-driven perivascular drainage of Abeta in AD/CAA. METHODS: We explored the expression of PDE III in postmortem human brain tissue followed by a series of experiments examining the effects of cilostazol on Abeta metabolism in transgenic mice (Tg-SwDI mice) as a model of cerebrovascular beta-amyloidosis, as well as cultured neurons. RESULTS: We established that PDE III is abnormally upregulated in cerebral blood vessels of AD and CAA subjects and closely correlates with vascular amyloid burden. Furthermore, we demonstrated that cilostazol treatment maintained cerebral hyperemic and vasodilative responses to hypercapnia and acetylcholine, suppressed degeneration of pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells, promoted perivascular drainage of soluble fluorescent Abeta1-40, and rescued cognitive deficits in Tg-SwDI mice. Although cilostazol decreased endogenous Abeta production in cultured neurons, C-terminal fragment of amyloid precursor protein expression was not altered in cilostazol-treated Tg-SwDI mice. INTERPRETATION: The predominant action of cilostazol on Abeta metabolism is likely to facilitate Abeta clearance due to the sustained cerebrovascular function in vivo. Our findings mechanistically demonstrate that cilostazol is a promising therapeutic approach for AD and CAA.

25356425|t|Diagnostic accuracy of CSF Ab42 and florbetapir PET for Alzheimer's disease.
25356425|a|BACKGROUND: Reduced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) beta-amyloid42 (Abeta42) and increased florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) uptake reflects brain Abeta accumulation. These biomarkers are correlated with each other and altered in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but no study has directly compared their diagnostic performance. METHODS: We examined healthy controls (CN, N = 169) versus AD dementia patients (N = 118), and stable (sMCI; no dementia, followed up for at least 2 years, N = 165) versus progressive MCI (pMCI; conversion to AD dementia, N = 59). All subjects had florbetapir PET (global and regional; temporal, frontal, parietal, and cingulate) and CSF Abeta42 measurements at baseline. We compared area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity (testing a priori and optimized cutoffs). Clinical diagnosis was the reference standard. RESULTS: CSF Abeta42 and (global or regional) PET florbetapir did not differ in AUC (CN vs. AD, CSF 84.4%; global PET 86.9%; difference [95% confidence interval] -6.7 to 1.5). CSF Abeta42 and global PET florbetapir did not differ in sensitivity, but PET had greater specificity than CSF in most comparisons. Sixteen CN progressed to MCI and AD (six Abeta negative, seven Abeta positive, and three PET positive but CSF negative). INTERPRETATION: The overall diagnostic accuracies of CSF Abeta42 and PET florbetapir were similar, but PET had greater specificity. This was because some CN and sMCI subjects appear pathological using CSF but not using PET, suggesting that low CSF Abeta42 not always translates to cognitive decline or brain Abeta accumulation. Other factors, including costs and side effects, may also be considered when determining the optimal modality for different applications.

25358680|t|Voyage au bout de la nuit: Abeta and tau imaging in dementias.
25358680|a|The last decade has witnessed the development and characterization of tracers for the evaluation of neuropathology in vivo. The introduction of these tracers, namely beta-amyloid (Abeta) and later tau, are providing the tools to change the landscape and refine our understanding of Abeta and tau deposition in the brain, allowing to investigate the causes, refine diagnosis and improve treatment of major neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Abeta and tau imaging allow examination of the regional and global changes of these disease markers over time as well as their relationship with other relevant parameters such as cognitive performance and neurodegenerative changes. Abeta and tau imaging will enable to establish the role Abeta and tau play -and interplay- in aging and disease. Abeta and tau imaging value resides in being not only diagnostic, prognostic or progression markers, but also surrogate markers of disease, crucial for patient recruitment and efficacy evaluation of disease-specific therapies.

25360827|t|Cholesterol drives abeta(1-42) interaction with lipid rafts in model membranes.
25360827|a|The molecular mechanism at the basis of the neurodegenerative process related to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is triggered by the local composition of the neural plasma membrane. The role of cholesterol is controversial. In this investigation the interaction of the AD peptide amyloid-beta (1-42) with model membranes containing lipid rafts has been investigated by atomic force microscopy techniques. Supported lipid membranes made of phospholipids/sphingomyelin/cholesterol have been investigated as a function of the molar content of cholesterol, in a range spanning the phase diagram of the lipid system. The administration of amyloid-beta induced a phase reorganization of the lipid domains, when the cholesterol molar fraction was below 5%. At the same time, a mechanical destabilization and an appreciable thinning of the membrane induced by the peptide were detected. The major interaction was observed in the presence of the gel phase Lbeta, and was enhanced by a low cholesterol amount. With the appearance of the liquid ordered phase Lo, the effect was hindered. At high cholesterol content (20% mol), no detectable effects in the bilayer morphology or in its mechanical stability were recorded. These findings give new insights on the molecular mechanism of the amyloid/membrane interaction, highlighting the peculiar role of cholesterol.

We retrospectively analysed the effect of the NFKB1 -94ins/delATTG polymorphism on the survival of 295 MM patients treated at a single centre. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 790 (659-921) d in patients with NFKB1 homozygous insertion genotype (I/I, n = 99) and 624 (515-733) d in deletion-carriers (I/D&D/D, n = 196, P = 0 013). In multivariate analysis, I/I carriers showed a favourable PFS compared to I/D&D/D with a hazard ratio of 0 622 (0 457-0 847), P = 0 003, in addition to international staging system (ISS) score, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) risk score, age and bortezomib treatment. I/I patients benefited more from bortezomib treatment [PFS 902 (703-1101) and 580 (343-817), P = 0 008] than I/D&D/D patients [PFS 659 (487-831) and 488 (323-653), P = 0 531]; in addition the beneficial effect of low ISS score was not observed in the I/D&D/D group [PFS 639 (454-824) and 650 (458-842), P = 0 226], while it was clear in I/I patients [PFS 1140 (803-1477) and 580 (408-752), P < 0 001]. We conclude that homozygous carriers of the insertion allele of the NFKB1 -94ins/delATTG polymorphism have a better prognosis and probably benefit more from bortezomib treatment than MM patients carrying the deletion allele.

Further optimization of the P3 and P2' side chains resulted in the identification of 42 (AMG-8718), a compound with a balanced profile of BACE1 potency, hERG binding affinity, and Pgp recognition. This compound produced robust and sustained reductions of CSF and brain Abeta levels in a rat pharmacodynamic model and exhibited significantly reduced potential for QTc elongation in a cardiovascular safety model.

25363760|t|Synaptic, transcriptional and chromatin genes disrupted in autism.
25363760|a|The genetic architecture of autism spectrum disorder involves the interplay of common and rare variants and their impact on hundreds of genes. Using exome sequencing, here we show that analysis of rare coding variation in 3,871 autism cases and 9,937 ancestry-matched or parental controls implicates 22 autosomal genes at a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05, plus a set of 107 autosomal genes strongly enriched for those likely to affect risk (FDR < 0.30). These 107 genes, which show unusual evolutionary constraint against mutations, incur de novo loss-of-function mutations in over 5% of autistic subjects. Many of the genes implicated encode proteins for synaptic formation, transcriptional regulation and chromatin-remodelling pathways. These include voltage-gated ion channels regulating the propagation of action potentials, pacemaking and excitability-transcription coupling, as well as histone-modifying enzymes and chromatin remodellers-most prominently those that mediate post-translational lysine methylation/demethylation modifications of histones.

25364287|t|The epigenetic dimension of Alzheimer's disease: causal, consequence, or curiosity?
25364287|a|Early-onset, familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) is rare and may be attributed to disease-causinq mutations. By contrast, late onset, sporadic (non-Mendelian) AD is far more prevalent and reflects the interaction of multiple genetic and environmental risk factors, together with the disruption of epigenetic mechanisms controlling gene expression. Accordingly, abnormal patterns of histone acetylation and methylation, as well as anomalies in global and promoter-specific DNA methylation, have been documented in AD patients, together with a deregulation of noncoding RNA. In transgenic mouse models for AD, epigenetic dysfunction is likewise apparent in cerebral tissue, and it has been directly linked to cognitive and behavioral deficits in functional studies. Importantly, epigenetic deregulation interfaces with core pathophysiological processes underlying AD: excess production of Abeta42, aberrant post-translational modification of tau, deficient neurotoxic protein clearance, axonal-synaptic dysfunction, mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis, and cell cycle re-entry. Reciprocally, DNA methylation, histone marks and the levels of diverse species of microRNA are modulated by Abeta42, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. In conclusion, epigenetic mechanisms are broadly deregulated in AD mainly upstream, but also downstream, of key pathophysiological processes. While some epigenetic shifts oppose the evolution of AD, most appear to drive its progression. Epigenetic changes are of irrefutable importance for AD, but they await further elucidation from the perspectives of pathogenesis, biomarkers and potential treatment.

25366883|t|Prostate biopsy perineural invasion is not independently associated with positive surgical margins following radical retropubic prostatectomy.
25366883|a|PURPOSE: Perineural invasion (PNI) in prostate cancer has been associated with poor prognosis. We sought to determine whether biopsy and radical prostatectomy (RP) PNI are associated with adverse outcomes. A secondary objective was to determine whether prostate biopsy PNI should alter surgical technique. METHODS: Patients were categorized by PNI on biopsy and RP specimens. Associations between PNI, clinicopathologic characteristics, and biochemical recurrence (BCR) rates were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 2,500 patients undergoing open RP by a single-surgeon from 1999 to 2011 were analyzed. In unadjusted univariate analyses, biopsy PNI was significantly associated with Gleason score, clinical stage, positive surgical margins, extraprostatic extension (EPE), seminal vesicle invasion (SVI), positive lymph nodes, and BCR (p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, EPE (p < 0.001), and SVI (p = 0.022) remained associated with biopsy PNI. Biopsy PNI was not associated with positive margins at RP (OR 1.3, 95 % CI 0.92-1.9). The presence of PNI in the final RP specimen conferred a greater than 4 times increased odds of positive margin (OR 4.6, 95 % CI 2.30-9.22; p < 0.0001). Men with PNI on biopsy were 1.5 times more likely to experience BCR (OR 1.5, 1.06-2.01). PNI on biopsy or RP specimens was not associated with overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: In men undergoing open RP for clinically localized prostate adenocarcinoma, biopsy PNI is associated with an increased risk of BCR. PNI on prostate biopsy was not associated with positive surgical margins after adjusting for related co-variables. The presence of PNI on prostate biopsy should not preclude utilization of a nerve-sparing approach.

25367796|t|Bag5 protects neuronal cells from amyloid beta-induced cell death.
25367796|a|The pathological mechanism of Alzheimer's disease (AD) needs to be elucidated. The Bcl-2 associated athanogene 5 (Bag5) is an important member in the Bag family. However, the role of Bag5 in AD has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we found that expression of Bag5 is elevated in the brains of AD transgenic Tg2576 mice at both mRNA levels and proteins. In vitro experiments indicated that Abeta1-42 treatment led to the upregulation of Bag5 in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, our results indicated that inhibition of Bag5 using small RNA interferences exacerbated Abeta1-42-induced neurotoxicity. On one hand, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay demonstrated that inhibition of Bag5 exacerbated Abeta1-42-related cell death. On the other hand, silence of endogenous Bag5 promotes the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) induced by Abeta1-42. Finally and importantly, it was shown that knockdown of Bag5 exacerbated Abeta1-42-induced apoptosis and caspase-3 cleavage. These data suggest that induction of Bag5 might have a neuroprotective effect in AD.

25370340|t|Ligand-based molecular MRI: O-17 JJVCPE amyloid imaging in transgenic mice.
25370340|a|BACKGROUND: Development of molecular MR imaging (MRI) similar to PET imaging using contrast agents such as gadolinium as probe have been inherently hampered by incompatibility between potential probe (charged molecules) and membrane permeability. Nevertheless, considering the inherent spatial resolution limit for PET of 700mu, the superior microscopic resolution of MRI of 4 mu presents a strong incentive for research into ligand-based molecular MRI. METHODS: (17) O exhibits JJ vicinal coupling with a covalently bound proton in a hydroxyl group. This (17) O coupled proton can be ionized in water solution and interexchange with other water protons. This property can be utilized as "probe" in T2-weighted imaging and developed into ligand-based molecular MRI. We examined beta-amyloid distribution in human APP overexpressed transgenic mice in vivo following injection of (17) O labeled Pittsburg compound B ((17) O-PiB). RESULTS: JJVCPE imaging successfully imaged (17) O-PiB, unequivocally establishing that (17) O JJVCPE imaging can be developed into PET-like molecular MRI in clinical medicine. CONCLUSIONS: The study represents the first successful ligand-based molecular MRI in vivo. This is also the first in vivo amyloid imaging using MRI. High-resolution molecular MRI with high specificity under clinical settings, such as in vivo microscopic imaging of senile plaque, is a foreseeable aim.

25375761|t|Toxic oligomer species of amyloid-beta in Alzheimer's disease, a timing issue.
25375761|a|A decade following the paradigm-shifting concept that endogenous forms of soluble, non-fibrillar amyloid-beta (Abeta) might constitute the major bioactive entity causing synaptic loss and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD), our understanding of these oligomeric species still remains conspicuously superficial. The current lack of direct evaluation tools for each endogenous Abeta oligomer hampers our ability to readily address crucial question such as: (i) where they form and accumulate?; (ii) when they first appear in human brains and body fluids?; (iii) what is the longitudinal expression of these putative toxins during the course of the disease?; (iv) and how do these soluble Abeta assemblies alter synaptic and neuronal function in the brain? Despite these limitations, indirect ex vivo measurement and isolation from biological specimens has been possible and have allowed parsing out intrinsic differences between putative endogenous Abeta oligomers. In this review, I integrated recent findings and extrapolated emerging hypotheses derived from these studies with the hope to provide a clarified view on the putative role of endogenous Abeta oligomers in AD, with a particular emphasis on the timing at which these soluble species might act in the aging and diseased brain.

25376108|t|beta-Amyloid peptides display protective activity against the human Alzheimer's disease-associated herpes simplex virus-1.
25376108|a|Amyloid plaques, the hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), contain fibrillar beta-amyloid (Abeta) 1-40 and 1-42 peptides. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) has been implicated as a risk factor for AD and found to co-localize within amyloid plaques. Abeta 1-40 and Abeta 1-42 display anti-bacterial, anti-yeast and anti-viral activities. Here, fibroblast, epithelial and neuronal cell lines were exposed to Abeta 1-40 or Abeta 1-42 and challenged with HSV-1. Quantitative analysis revealed that Abeta 1-40 and Abeta 1-42 inhibited HSV-1 replication when added 2 h prior to or concomitantly with virus challenge, but not when added 2 or 6 h after virus addition. In contrast, Abeta 1-40 and Abeta 1-42 did not prevent replication of the non-enveloped human adenovirus. In comparison, antimicrobial peptide LL-37 prevented HSV-1 infection independently of its sequence of addition. Our findings showed also that Abeta 1-40 and Abeta 1-42 acted directly on HSV-1 in a cell-free system and prevented viral entry into cells. The sequence homology between Abeta and a proximal transmembrane region of HSV-1 glycoprotein B suggested that Abeta interference with HSV-1 replication could involve its insertion into the HSV-1 envelope. Our data suggest that Abeta peptides represent a novel class of antimicrobial peptides that protect against neurotropic enveloped virus infections such as HSV-1. Overproduction of Abeta peptide to protect against latent herpes viruses and eventually against other infections, may contribute to amyloid plaque formation, and partially explain why brain infections play a pathogenic role in the progression of the sporadic form of AD.

25376379|t|The Arctic mutation accelerates Abeta aggregation in SDS through reducing the helical propensity of residues 15-25.
25376379|a|Mutations within the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) sequence that cause early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) have been shown to promote Abeta aggregation. How these FAD-related mutants increase the aggregative ability of Abeta is not fully understood. Here, we characterized the effect of the Arctic variant (E22G) on the conformational stability of Abeta using various forms of spectroscopy and kinetic analyses, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The E22G mutation in the Arctic variant reduced the alpha-helical propensity and conformational stability of Abeta on residues 15-25. This mutation also caused an increase in both alpha-helix-to-beta-strand conversion and fibril nucleation rates. Our results suggest that the alpha-helical propensity of residues 15-25 may play a determinant role in the aggregative ability of Abeta. This may provide a structural basis for understanding the molecular mechanism of Abeta aggregation.

25376633|t|Gold-nanoparticle-based multifunctional amyloid-beta inhibitor against Alzheimer's disease.
25376633|a|Targeting amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced complex neurotoxicity has received considerable attention in the therapeutic and preventive treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The complex pathogenesis of AD suggests that it requires comprehensive treatment, and drugs with multiple functions against AD are more desirable. Herein, AuNPs@POMD-pep (AuNPs: gold nanoparticles, POMD: polyoxometalate with Wells-Dawson structure, pep: peptide) were designed as a novel multifunctional Abeta inhibitor. AuNPs@POMD-pep shows synergistic effects in inhibiting Abeta aggregation, dissociating Abeta fibrils and decreasing Abeta-mediated peroxidase activity and Abeta-induced cytotoxicity. By taking advantage of AuNPs as vehicles that can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), AuNPs@POMD-pep can cross the BBB and thus overcome the drawbacks of small-molecule anti-AD drugs. Thus, this work provides new insights into the design and synthesis of inorganic nanoparticles as multifunctional therapeutic agents for treatment of AD.

25377128|t|Unique molecular signatures of Alzheimer's disease amyloid beta peptide mutations and deletion during aggregate/oligomer/fibril formation.
25377128|a|The formation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide aggregates, oligomers, and fibrils is a dynamic process; however, the kinetics of their formation is not well understood. This study compares the time course of aggregate/fibril formation by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses with that of oligomer/fibril formation by Western blot analysis under native and denaturing conditions. Efforts to deaggregate/defibrillate these peptides by using hexafluoroisopropanol, ammonium hydroxide, or dimethylsulfoxide did not change the nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) footprints or drive the peptides to a monomeric species. Regardless of the pretreatment protocol, TEM analyses reveal that all Abeta peptides (Abeta40, Abeta42, Abeta39E22Delta [Osaka], Abeta40E22G [Arctic], Abeta40E22Q [Dutch], and Abeta40A2T [Icelandic]) immediately formed nonfibrillar, amorphous aggregates when first placed into solution with the Osaka mutation, quickly forming early-stage fibrils. The extent of fibril formation for other Abeta peptides is time dependent, with the Arctic mutation forming fibrils at 1 hr, the Dutch and Icelandic at 4 hr, Abeta42 at 8 hr, and Abeta40 at 24 hr. In contrast, nondenaturing PAGE revealed unique footprints for the different Abeta species. The rapidity of aggregate formation and the rapid transition to fibrils, particularly for the Osaka deletion, suggest an important role for aggregates/fibrils of Abeta in the development of neuronal degeneration.

25378159|t|Synaptic and cognitive improvements by inhibition of 2-AG metabolism are through upregulation of microRNA-188-3p in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
25378159|a|Abnormal accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) is the major neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanisms underlying aberrant Abeta formation in AD remain unclear. We showed previously that inhibition of monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), the primary enzyme that metabolizes the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) in the brain, robustly reduces Abeta by inhibiting beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), a key enzyme responsible for Abeta formation. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for suppression of BACE1 by inhibition of 2-AG metabolism are largely unknown. We demonstrate here that expression of the noncoding small RNA miR-188-3p that targets BACE1 was significantly downregulated both in the brains of AD humans and APP transgenic (TG) mice, a mouse model of AD. The downregulated miR-188-3p expression was restored by MAGL inhibition. Overexpression of miR-188-3p in the hippocampus reduced BACE1, Abeta, and neuroinflammation and prevented deteriorations in hippocampal basal synaptic transmission, long-term potentiation, spatial learning, and memory in TG mice. 2-AG-induced suppression of BACE1 was prevented by miR-188-3p loss of function. Moreover, miR-188-3p expression was upregulated by 2-AG or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) agonists and suppressed by PPARgamma antagonism or NF-kappaB activation. Reducing Abeta and neuroinflammation by MAGL inhibition was occluded by PPARgamma antagonism. In addition, BACE1 suppression by 2-AG and PPARgamma activation was eliminated by knockdown of NF-kappaB. Our study provides a novel molecular mechanism underlying improved synaptic and cognitive function in TG mice by 2-AG signaling, which upregulates miR-188-3p expression through PPARgamma and NF-kappaB signaling pathway, resulting in suppressions of BACE1 expression and Abeta formation.

25378646|t|Therapeutic bispecific antibodies cross the blood-brain barrier in nonhuman primates.
25378646|a|Using therapeutic antibodies that need to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to treat neurological disease is a difficult challenge. We have shown that bispecific antibodies with optimized binding to the transferrin receptor (TfR) that target beta-secretase (BACE1) can cross the BBB and reduce brain amyloid-beta (Abeta) in mice. Can TfR enhance antibody uptake in the primate brain? We describe two humanized TfR/BACE1 bispecific antibody variants. Using a human TfR knock-in mouse, we observed that anti-TfR/BACE1 antibodies could cross the BBB and reduce brain Abeta in a TfR affinity-dependent fashion. Intravenous dosing of monkeys with anti-TfR/BACE1 antibodies also reduced Abeta both in cerebral spinal fluid and in brain tissue, and the degree of reduction correlated with the brain concentration of anti-TfR/BACE1 antibody. These results demonstrate that the TfR bispecific antibody platform can robustly and safely deliver therapeutic antibody across the BBB in the primate brain.

25379854|t|Early survival and safety of ALPPS: first report of the International ALPPS Registry.
25379854|a|OBJECTIVES: To assess safety and outcomes of the novel 2-stage hepatectomy, Associating Liver Partition and Portal Vein Ligation for Staged Hepatectomy (ALPPS), using an international registry. BACKGROUND: ALPPS induces accelerated growth of small future liver remnants (FLR) to allow curative resection of liver tumors. There is concern about safety based on reports of higher morbidity and mortality. METHODS: A Web-based data entry system was created with password access and data pseudoencryption (NCT01924741). All patients with complete 90-day data were included. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for severe complications and mortality and volume growth of the FLR. RESULTS: Complete data were available for 202 patients. A total of 141 (70%) patients had colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). Median starting standardized future liver remnants of 21% increased by 80% within a median of 7 days. Ninety-day mortality was 19/202 (9%). Severe complications including mortalities (Clavien-Dindo>=IIIb) occurred in 27% of patients. Independent factors for severe complications were red blood cell transfusion [odds ratio (OR), 5.2), ALPPS stage I operating time greater than 300 minutes (OR, 4.4), age more than 60 years (OR, 3.8), and non-CRLM (OR, 2.7). Age, use of Pringle maneuver, and histologic changes led to less volume growth. In patients younger than 60 years with CRLM, 90-day mortality was similar to conventional 2-stage hepatectomies for CRLM. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first analysis of the ALPPS registry showing that ALPPS has increased perioperative morbidity and mortality in older patients but better outcomes in patients with CRLM.

25380342|t|Concept for simultaneous and specific in situ monitoring of amyloid oligomers and fibrils via Forster resonance energy transfer.
25380342|a|Oligomeric species of amyloidogenic peptides or proteins are often considered as the most toxic species in several amyloid disorders, like Alzheimer or Parkinson's diseases, and hence came into the focus of research interest and as a therapeutic target. An easy and specific monitoring of oligomeric species would be of high utility in the field, as it is the case for thioflavin T fluorescence for the fibrillar aggregates. Here, we show proof of concept for a new sensitive method to increase specific detection of oligomers by two extrinsic fluorophores. This is achieved by exploiting a Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the two fluorophores. Thus, a mixture of two extrinsic fluorophores, bis-ANS and a styrylquinoxalin derivative, enabled one to monitor simultaneously and in situ the presence of oligomers and fibrils of amyloidogenic peptides. Thereby, the formation of oligomers and their transformation into fibrils can be followed.

25380623|t|The beta-amyloid precursor protein analog P165 improves impaired insulin signal transduction in type 2 diabetic rats.
25380623|a|This study was performed to understand whether P165 improves learning and memory by restoring insulin action using a diabetes mellitus (DM) rat model. A total of 34 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: control group (n = 8), DM group (n = 8), DM group treated with a low dose of P165 (n = 9), and DM group treated with a high dose of P165 (n = 9). After 8 weeks of treatment, the animals were killed and the expression of insulin signaling-related proteins was examined in the hippocampus by Western blot and immunohistochemical staining. Administration of P165 in diabetic rats did not induce a significant effect on the fasting blood glucose level. The expression of IR, IRS-1, AKT, p-CREB, and Bcl-2 proteins was significantly enhanced in the hippocampus in diabetic rats. Treatment of diabetic rats with P165 at both low and high doses significantly attenuated the expression levels of these proteins. Moreover, immunohistochemistry staining showed that IR, IRS-1, AKT, p-CREB, and Bcl-2 were abundantly expressed in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. The number of cells positively stained for the above proteins was significantly higher in diabetic tissues compared to control tissues, whereas P165 treatments induced a significant reduction in the expression of these proteins. The expression of IR, IRS-1, AKT, p-CREB, and Bcl-2 was enhanced in DM rats, and administration of P165 normalized the expression of these molecules, suggesting that P165 can improve impaired insulin signal transduction.

25381384|t|Breakthrough pain management using fentanyl buccal tablet (FBT) in combination with around-the-clock (ATC) opioids based on the efficacy and safety of FBT, and its relationship with ATC opioids: results from an open-label, multi-center study in Japanese cancer patients with detailed evaluation.
25381384|a|OBJECTIVE: Rapid analgesic onset opioids, particularly fentanyl buccal tablet, is preferable for managing breakthrough pain. The efficacy and safety of fentanyl buccal tablet and its association with around-the-clock opioids needs to be explored with an option of dose adjustments, more closely reflecting administration in clinical practice. The aim of the study was to assess the safety and efficacy of fentanyl buccal tablet in breakthrough pain management in combination with around-the-clock opioids with the dose adjustment option, and explore the dose adjustment's influence on breakthrough pain management using detailed evaluation. METHODS: The 12-week open-label, multi-center study was conducted throughout Japan. Cancer patients aged 20 years or older, experiencing persistent pain controlled with around-the-clock opioids and breakthrough pain with supplemental medications were enrolled. Fentanyl buccal tablet and around-the-clock opioid doses could be adjusted under protocol-specified conditions. Efficacy variables were assessed at each fentanyl buccal tablet administration. Safety was assessed mainly by adverse events. RESULTS: All efficacy variables showed sustained analgesic effect. Nearly half the patients stayed on the same dose; most fentanyl buccal tablet administrations did not require additional supplemental medications. Dose increase of fentanyl buccal tablet and around-the-clock opioids seemed to improve breakthrough pain intensity and frequency, respectively. Fentanyl buccal tablet and around-the-clock opioid doses were not strongly associated. Treatment-related adverse events were all common with opioid treatment and did not increase over time. CONCLUSIONS: Fentanyl buccal tablet can stably and safely manage breakthrough pain in cancer patients with independent dose adjustment based on detailed evaluation of each patient's condition. Breakthrough pain management using fentanyl buccal tablet with around-the-clock opioids at optimal doses may be an important factor in palliative care for cancer patients with breakthrough pain.

25381547|t|Stability of Iowa mutant and wild type Abeta-peptide aggregates.
25381547|a|Recent experiments indicate a connection between the structure of amyloid aggregates and their cytotoxicity as related to neurodegenerative diseases. Of particular interest is the Iowa Mutant, which causes early-onset of Alzheimer's disease. While wild-type Amyloid beta-peptides form only parallel beta-sheet aggregates, the mutant also forms meta-stable antiparallel beta sheets. Since these structural variations may cause the difference in the pathological effects of the two Abeta-peptides, we have studied in silico the relative stability of the wild type and Iowa mutant in both parallel and antiparallel forms. We compare regular molecular dynamics simulations with such where the viscosity of the samples is reduced, which, we show, leads to higher sampling efficiency. By analyzing and comparing these four sets of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we probe the role of the various factors that could lead to the structural differences. Our analysis indicates that the parallel forms of both wild type and Iowa mutant aggregates are stable, while the antiparallel aggregates are meta-stable for the Iowa mutant and not stable for the wild type. The differences result from the direct alignment of hydrophobic interactions in the in-register parallel oligomers, making them more stable than the antiparallel aggregates. The slightly higher thermodynamic stability of the Iowa mutant fibril-like oligomers in its parallel organization over that in antiparallel form is supported by previous experimental measurements showing slow inter-conversion of antiparallel aggregates into parallel ones. Knowledge of the mechanism that selects between parallel and antiparallel conformations and determines their relative stability may open new avenues for the development of therapies targeting familial forms of early-onset Alzheimer's disease.

25382069|t|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis onset is influenced by the burden of rare variants in known amyotrophic lateral sclerosis genes.
25382069|a|OBJECTIVE: To define the genetic landscape of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and assess the contribution of possible oligogenic inheritance, we aimed to comprehensively sequence 17 known ALS genes in 391 ALS patients from the United States. METHODS: Targeted pooled-sample sequencing was used to identify variants in 17 ALS genes. Fragment size analysis was used to define ATXN2 and C9ORF72 expansion sizes. Genotype-phenotype correlations were made with individual variants and total burden of variants. Rare variant associations for risk of ALS were investigated at both the single variant and gene level. RESULTS: A total of 64.3% of familial and 27.8% of sporadic subjects carried potentially pathogenic novel or rare coding variants identified by sequencing or an expanded repeat in C9ORF72 or ATXN2; 3.8% of subjects had variants in >1 ALS gene, and these individuals had disease onset 10 years earlier (p = 0.0046) than subjects with variants in a single gene. The number of potentially pathogenic coding variants did not influence disease duration or site of onset. INTERPRETATION: Rare and potentially pathogenic variants in known ALS genes are present in >25% of apparently sporadic and 64% of familial patients, significantly higher than previous reports using less comprehensive sequencing approaches. A significant number of subjects carried variants in >1 gene, which influenced the age of symptom onset and supports oligogenic inheritance as relevant to disease pathogenesis.

25382225|t|A synchrotron-based hydroxyl radical footprinting analysis of amyloid fibrils and prefibrillar intermediates with residue-specific resolution.
25382225|a|Structural models of the fibrils formed by the 40-residue amyloid-beta (Abeta40) peptide in Alzheimer's disease typically consist of linear polypeptide segments, oriented approximately perpendicular to the long axis of the fibril, and joined together as parallel in-register beta-sheets to form filaments. However, various models differ in the number of filaments that run the length of a fibril, and in the topological arrangement of these filaments. In addition to questions about the structure of Abeta40 monomers in fibrils, there are important unanswered questions about their structure in prefibrillar intermediates, which are of interest because they may represent the most neurotoxic form of Abeta40. To assess different models of fibril structure and to gain insight into the structure of prefibrillar intermediates, the relative solvent accessibility of amino acid residue side chains in fibrillar and prefibrillar Abeta40 preparations was characterized in solution by hydroxyl radical footprinting and structural mass spectrometry. A key to the application of this technology was the development of hydroxyl radical reactivity measures for individual side chains of Abeta40. Combined with mass-per-length measurements performed by dark-field electron microscopy, the results of this study are consistent with the core filament structure represented by two- and three-filament solid state nuclear magnetic resonance-based models of the Abeta40 fibril (such as 2LMN , 2LMO , 2LMP , and 2LMQ ), with minor refinements, but they are inconsistent with the more recently proposed 2M4J model. The results also demonstrate that individual Abeta40 fibrils exhibit structural heterogeneity or polymorphism, where regions of two-filament structure alternate with regions of three-filament structure. The footprinting approach utilized in this study will be valuable for characterizing various fibrillar and nonfibrillar forms of the Abeta peptide.

25384087|t|Longitudinal PET-MRI reveals beta-amyloid deposition and rCBF dynamics and connects vascular amyloidosis to quantitative loss of perfusion.
25384087|a|The dynamics of beta-amyloid deposition and related second-order physiological effects, such as regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), are key factors for a deeper understanding of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We present longitudinal in vivo data on the dynamics of beta-amyloid deposition and the decline of rCBF in two different amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mouse models of AD. Using a multiparametric positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging approach, we demonstrate that in the presence of cerebral beta-amyloid angiopathy (CAA), beta-amyloid deposition is accompanied by a decline of rCBF. Loss of perfusion correlates with the growth of beta-amyloid plaque burden but is not related to the number of CAA-induced microhemorrhages. However, in a mouse model of parenchymal beta-amyloidosis and negligible CAA, rCBF is unchanged. Because synaptically driven spontaneous network activity is similar in both transgenic mouse strains, we conclude that the disease-related decline of rCBF is caused by CAA.

25384129|t|Amyloid-beta-activated human microglial cells through ER-resident proteins.
25384129|a|Microglial activation in the central nervous system is a key event in the neuroinflammation that accompanies neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Among cytokines involved in microglial activation, amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide is known to be a key molecule in the induction of diverse inflammatory products, which may lead to chronic inflammation in AD. However, proteomic studies of microglia in AD are limited due to lack of proper cell or animal model systems. In this study, we performed a proteomic analysis of Abeta-stimulated human microglial cells using SILAC (stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture) combined with LC-MS/MS. Results showed that 60 proteins increased or decreased their abundance by 1.5 fold or greater. Among these, ER-resident proteins such as SERPINH1, PDIA6, PDIA3, and PPIB were revealed to be key molecular biomarkers of human microglial activation by validation of the proteomic results by immunostaining, PCR, ELISA, and Western blot. Taken together, our data suggest that ER proteins play an essential role in human microglial activation by Abeta and may be important molecular therapeutic targets for treatment of AD.

25384422|t|Activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway represses the transcription of the beta-amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (BACE1) via binding of T-cell factor-4 to BACE1 promoter.
25384422|a|Alterations in the Wnt signaling pathway have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease; however, its role in the processing of the amyloid precursor protein remains unknown. In this study, activation of the Wnt pathway by overexpression of the agonist Wnt3a or beta-catenin or by inhibition of glycogen kinase synthase-3 in N2a cells resulted in a reduction in Abeta levels and in the activity and expression of BACE1 (beta-APP cleaving enzyme). Conversely, inhibition of the pathway by transfection of the antagonists secreted frizzled receptor protein-1 or dickkopf-1 produced the opposite effects. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that beta-catenin binds specifically to regions within the promoter of BACE1 containing putative T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer binding factor-1 (TCF/LEF) motifs, consistent with canonical Wnt target regulation. Furthermore, cells transfected with beta-catenin mutants incapable of binding to TCF/LEF increased BACE1 gene promoter activity. Interestingly, TCF4 knockdown reversed the effects of Wnt3a activation on BACE1 transcription. We found that TCF4 binds to the same region on BACE1 promoter following Wnt3a stimulation, indicating that TCF4 functions as a transcriptional repressor of BACE1 gene. In conclusion, Wnt/beta-catenin stimulation may repress BACE1 transcription via binding of TCF4 to BACE1 gene, and therefore, activation of the Wnt pathway may hold the key to new treatments of Alzheimer disease.-Parr, C., Mirzaei, N., Christian, M., and Sastre, M. Activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway represses the transcription of the beta-amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (BACE1) via binding of T-cell factor-4 to BACE1 promoter.

25384918|t|Mesenchymal stem cells can prevent alterations in behavior and neurogenesis induced by Ass25-35 administration.
25384918|a|Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known to enhance neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus, as well as to modulate immune cell activity and inflammation. Easily obtained and expanded from the bone marrow and other tissues, MSCs have been proposed as candidates for stem cell therapy in various neurodegenerartive diseases. In the present study, we sought to explore these therapeutic properties of MSC on Ass25-35-induced pathology when coadministered together. Apparently, coadministration of MSC prevented mild cognitive deficits observed following Ass administration alone, by promoting microglial activation and rapid clearance of injected Ass aggregates. Surprisingly, increased hippocampal neurogenesis was observed in the Ass-injected animals and was normal in MSC-coadministered animals just as in control animals. The observed increase in neurogenesis can be explained as a compensating mechanism responsible for the mild and temporary cognitive deficits observed in the Morris water maze assay in Ass-injected animals. Interestingly, MSC engrafted not only to the hippocampus but were also detected in the choroid plexus. We thus conclude that MSC may act in multiple pathways to protect the CNS from Ass pathology, while neurogenesis is a possible compensating mechanism; it is not always activated by MSC, which in turn may interact with local immune cells to regulate Ass accumulation.

25385278|t|Impact of early use of lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone on clinical outcomes in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.
25385278|a|We retrospectively investigated the prognostic factor of lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone (Rd) in Japanese patients with refractory or relapsed multiple myeloma (RRMM) registered in the Kansai Myeloma Forum from January 2006 to December 2013. A total of 140 patients were analyzed. The median age was 66 years. The overall response rate was 68.6 %, including 33.1 % with a better than very good partial response. At 13.0 months median follow-up, the median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 34.2 and 17.0 months, respectively. In univariate analyses, patients with one or two prior therapies had significantly longer OS (41.2 vs. 21.5 months; P = 0.002) and PFS (29.0 vs. 13.0 months; P = 0.006) than patients treated with three or more prior therapies. Prior use of thalidomide was associated with significantly shorter PFS (19.0 vs. 16.0 months; P = 0.045). The prior use of bortezomib or high-dose therapy with stem cell transplantation, and the International Staging System had no impact on long-term outcome. Multivariate analysis showed that only the number of prior therapies was a significant predictor of both OS and PFS. Our findings suggest that greater benefit may occur when Rd therapy is used at the first or second relapse in RRMM.

25385447|t|The overlap between vascular disease and Alzheimer's disease--lessons from pathology.
25385447|a|Recent epidemiological and clinico-pathological data indicate considerable overlap between cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and suggest additive or synergistic effects of both pathologies on cognitive decline. The most frequent vascular pathologies in the aging brain and in AD are cerebral amyloid angiopathy and small vessel disease. Up to 84% of aged subjects show morphological substrates of CVD in addition to AD pathology. AD brains with minor CVD, similar to pure vascular dementia, show subcortical vascular lesions in about two-thirds, while in mixed type dementia (AD plus vascular dementia), multiple larger infarcts are more frequent. Small infarcts in patients with full-blown AD have no impact on cognitive decline but are overwhelmed by the severity of Alzheimer pathology, while in early stages of AD, cerebrovascular lesions may influence and promote cognitive impairment, lowering the threshold for clinically overt dementia. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the many hitherto unanswered questions regarding the overlap between CVD and AD as well as the impact of both CVD and AD pathologies on the development and progression of dementia.

25385658|t|Subretinal injection of amyloid-beta peptide accelerates RPE cell senescence and retinal degeneration.
25385658|a|Drusen are considered a hallmark characteristic of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In our previous study, we found that amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide, a component of drusen, induced the cells of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE; RPE cells) to enter senescence; however, its effects in vivo remain unknown. Thus, the present study was carried out to explore the in vivo effects of Abeta peptide on RPE cell senescence and senescence-associated inflammation in C57BL/6 mice. C57BL/6 mice received a subretinal injection of Abeta(1-42) peptide; on day 7 post-injection, the mice were anesthetized and subjected to whole-body perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS and the whole eyes were then enucleated. Retinal function was assessed by electroretinography (ERG), and the morphological characteristics of the retina were examined by light and electron microscopy. Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) was examined by confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (cSLO). The expression of p16INK4a, a marker of cellular senescence, was examined by immunofluorescence staining and western blot analysis. The RPE-choroid was analyzed for cytokine expression by RT-PCR. In Abeta(1-42)-injected mice, scotopic ERG responses declined. Degenerative alterations, including the disruption of the inner segment (IS)/outer segment (OS) junction and extensive vacuolation and thickness of Bruch's membrane (BrM) were observed under a a light microscope. The accumulation of vacuoles and the loss of basal infoldings in the RPE were identified using an electron microscope. FAF and p16INK4a expression increased in Abeta(1-42)-injected mice. In addition, Abeta(1-42) upregulated interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 gene expression in the RPE-choroid. In conclusion, our results confirm the effects of Abeta(1-42) peptide on RPE senescence in vivo. The Abeta-injected mice developed AMD-like ocular pathology. It is thus suggested that RPE cell senescence is a potential mechanistic link between inflammation and retinal degeneration.

25385741|t|Individual patient data analysis of progression-free survival versus overall survival as a first-line end point for metastatic colorectal cancer in modern randomized trials: findings from the analysis and research in cancers of the digestive system database.
25385741|a|PURPOSE: Progression-free survival (PFS) has previously been established as a surrogate for overall survival (OS) for first-line metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Because mCRC treatment has advanced in the last decade with extended OS, this surrogacy requires re-examination. METHODS: Individual patient data from 16,762 patients were available from 22 first-line mCRC studies conducted from 1997 to 2006; 12 of those studies tested antiangiogenic and/or anti-epidermal growth factor receptor agents. The relationship between PFS (first event of progression or death) and OS was evaluated by using R(2) statistics (the closer the value is to 1, the stronger the correlation) from weighted least squares regression of trial-specific hazard ratios estimated by using Cox and Copula models. RESULTS: Forty-four percent of patients received a regimen that included biologic agents. Median first-line PFS was 8.3 months, and median OS was 18.2 months. The correlation between PFS and OS was modest (R(2), 0.45 to 0.69). Analyses limited to trials that tested treatments with biologic agents, nonstrategy trials, or superiority trials did not improve surrogacy. CONCLUSION: In modern mCRC trials, in which survival after the first progression exceeds time to first progression, a positive but modest correlation was observed between OS and PFS at both the patient and trial levels. This finding demonstrates the substantial variability in OS introduced by the number of lines of therapy and types of effective subsequent treatments and the associated challenge to the use of OS as an end point to assess the benefit attributable to a single line of therapy. PFS remains an appropriate primary end point for first-line mCRC trials to detect the direct treatment effect of new agents.

25389560|t|Lead optimization and modulation of hERG activity in a series of aminooxazoline xanthene beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (BACE1) inhibitors.
25389560|a|The optimization of a series of aminooxazoline xanthene inhibitors of beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is described. An early lead compound showed robust Abeta lowering activity in a rat pharmacodynamic model, but advancement was precluded by a low therapeutic window to QTc prolongation in cardiovascular models consistent with in vitro activity on the hERG ion channel. While the introduction of polar groups was effective in reducing hERG binding affinity, this came at the expense of higher than desired Pgp-mediated efflux. A balance of low Pgp efflux and hERG activity was achieved by lowering the polar surface area of the P3 substituent while retaining polarity in the P2' side chain. The introduction of a fluorine in position 4 of the xanthene ring improved BACE1 potency (5-10-fold). The combination of these optimized fragments resulted in identification of compound 40, which showed robust Abeta reduction in a rat pharmacodynamic model (78% Abeta reduction in CSF at 10 mg/kg po) and also showed acceptable cardiovascular safety in vivo.

25391320|t|Novel plasma biomarker surrogating cerebral amyloid deposition.
25391320|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common and devastating dementia. Simple and practical biomarkers for AD are urgently required for accurate diagnosis and to facilitate the development of disease-modifying interventions. The subjects for the study were selected on the basis of PiB amyloid imaging by PET. Forty PiB-positive (PiB+) individuals, including cognitively healthy controls (HC), and mild cognitive impairment and AD individuals, and 22 PiB-negative (PiB-) HC participated. Employing our novel highly sensitive immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry, we measured plasma amyloid beta-proteins (Abetas; Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42) and Abeta-approximate peptides (AbetaAPs), which were cleaved from amyloid precursor protein (APP). Among the AbetaAPs, APP669-711 appeared to be a good reference for deciphering pathological change of Abeta1-42. We evaluated the performance of the ratio of APP669-711 to Abeta1-42 (APP669-711/Abeta1-42) as a biomarker. APP669-711/Abeta1-42 significantly increased in the PiB+ groups. The sensitivity and specificity to discriminate PiB+ individuals from PiB- individuals were 0.925 and 0.955, respectively. Our plasma biomarker precisely surrogates cerebral amyloid deposition.

25392130|t|Abeta anti-idiotypic antibodies are present in intravenous immunoglobulin and are produced in mice following its administration.
25392130|a|The effects of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) products were recently examined in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although encouraging results were obtained in pilot studies, later trials produced negative results. The rationale for these studies was that IVIG contains antibodies to amyloid-beta (Abeta). However, if Abeta anti-idiotypic antibodies (antibodies which bind to anti-Abeta antibodies) are present in IVIG or induced by its administration, these antibodies could potentially reduce its neuroprotective effects in AD. The objective of this study was to determine if IVIG contained such antibodies. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) measured specific binding of IVIG Gamunex to purified human anti-Abeta IgG. The mean concentration of its Abeta anti-idiotypic antibodies in four experiments was 1.85 mug/mL (18.5 mug/g IgG; range = 1.82-1.89 mug/mL [18.2-18.9 mug/g IgG]), and their mean percentage of specific binding was 72.2% (range = 68.3-75.3%). We then performed ELISAs to determine if antibodies to purified human anti-Abeta were produced in C57BL/6 mice injected with the IVIG product Gammagard in an earlier study. After subtracting the expected immune response to normal human immunoglobulins, the median concentrations of these antibodies were 15.6 ng/mL (range = 1.2-108.2 ng/mL) in pre-treatment sera and 2419.4 ng/mL (range = 327.4-8478.4 ng/mL) in post-treatment sera. These results indicate that specific Abeta anti-idiotypic antibodies are detectable in IVIG and may be induced in mice by its administration. The presence of Abeta anti-idiotypic antibodies in IVIG products might decrease neuroprotective effects of their anti-Abeta antibodies in AD.

25392299|t|Axonal amyloid precursor protein and its fragments undergo somatodendritic endocytosis and processing.
25392299|a|Deposition of potentially neurotoxic Abeta fragments derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP) at synapses may be a key contributor to Alzheimer's disease. However, the location(s) of proteolytic processing and subsequent secretion of APP fragments from highly compartmentalized, euploid neurons that express APP and processing enzymes at normal levels is not well understood. To probe the behavior of endogenous APP, particularly in human neurons, we developed a system using neurons differentiated from human embryonic stem cells, cultured in microfluidic devices, to enable direct biochemical measurements from axons. Using human or mouse neurons in these devices, we measured levels of Abeta, sAPPalpha, and sAPPbeta secreted solely from axons. We found that a majority of the fragments secreted from axons were processed in the soma, and many were dependent on somatic endocytosis for axonal secretion. We also observed that APP and the beta-site APP cleaving enzyme were, for the most part, not dependent on endocytosis for axonal entry. These data establish that axonal entry and secretion of APP and its proteolytic processing products traverse different pathways in the somatodendritic compartment before axonal entry.

25392515|t|Emerging roles of extracellular vesicles in the nervous system.
25392515|a|Information exchange executed by extracellular vesicles, including exosomes, is a newly described form of intercellular communication important in the development and physiology of neural systems. These vesicles can be released from cells, are packed with information including signaling proteins and both coding and regulatory RNAs, and can be taken up by target cells, thereby facilitating the transfer of multilevel information. Recent studies demonstrate their critical role in physiological processes, including nerve regeneration, synaptic function, and behavior. These vesicles also have a sinister role in the propagation of toxic amyloid proteins in neurodegenerative conditions, including prion diseases and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, in inducing neuroinflammation by exchange of information between the neurons and glia, as well as in aiding tumor progression in the brain by subversion of normal cells. This article provides a summary of topics covered in a symposium and is not meant to be a comprehensive review of the subject.

25395337|t|Atomic-resolution three-dimensional structure of amyloid beta fibrils bearing the Osaka mutation.
25395337|a|Despite its central importance for understanding the molecular basis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), high-resolution structural information on amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) fibrils, which are intimately linked with AD, is scarce. We report an atomic-resolution fibril structure of the Abeta1-40 peptide with the Osaka mutation (E22Delta), associated with early-onset AD. The structure, which differs substantially from all previously proposed models, is based on a large number of unambiguous intra- and intermolecular solid-state NMR distance restraints.

25397729|t|Structural evolution and membrane interaction of the 40-residue beta amyloid peptides: differences in the initial proximity between peptides and the membrane bilayer studied by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
25397729|a|Interactions between the beta amyloid (Abeta) peptides and cellular membranes have severe consequences such as neuronal cell disruption and therefore may play important roles in Alzheimer's disease. Understanding the structural basis behind such interactions, however, is hindered by the complexity of the Abeta-membrane systems. In particular, because the Abeta peptides are partially incorporated in the membrane bilayer after enzymatic cleavage, there are multiple possibilities in terms of the initial proximity between the peptides and membranes. Structural studies using in vitro model systems with either externally added or preincorporated Abeta in membrane bilayers resulted in distinct evolution pathways. Previous work has shown that the externally added Abeta formed long and mature filaments, while preincorporated Abeta generated short and curvy fibrils. In this study, we perform detailed characterizations on the structural evolution and membrane interaction for these two pathways, using a combination of solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and other techniques. For the externally added Abeta, we determined the residue-specific structural evolution during the fibrillation process. While the entire fibrillation process for the externally added Abeta was slow, the preincorporated Abeta generated Abeta-lipid complexes rapidly. Specific interactions between the lipids and peptides were observed, suggesting the colocalization of lipids and peptides within the complex. Formation of such a complex induced molecular-level changes in the lipid bilayer, which may serve as a possible mechanism of membrane disruption.

25399921|t|Comparison between the aggregation of human and rodent amyloid beta-proteins in GM1 ganglioside clusters.
25399921|a|The abnormal deposition of amyloids by amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aged rodents rarely develop the characteristic lesions of the disease, which is different from the case in humans. Rodent Abeta (rAbeta) differs from human Abeta (hAbeta) only in the three substitutions of Arg to Gly, Tyr to Phe, and His to Arg at positions 5, 10, and 13, respectively. Understanding the reason why rodent Abeta does not form amyloids is important to revealing factors that cause the abnormal aggregation of Abeta under pathologic conditions. We have proposed that the binding of Abeta to membranes with ganglioside clusters plays an important role in the abnormal aggregation of Abeta. In this study, we compared hAbeta and rAbeta in terms of aggregation on neuronal cells, on raftlike model membranes, and in buffer. We found that rAbeta formed amyloid fibrils similar to those of hAbeta in buffer solution. In contrast, on cell membranes and raftlike membranes, hAbeta formed toxic, mature amyloid fibrils, whereas rAbeta produced less toxic protofibrils that were not stained by the amyloid-specific dye Congo red. Thus, our ganglioside cluster-mediated amyloidogenesis hypothesis explains the immunity of rodents from cerebral Abeta amyloid deposition, strengthening the importance of ganglioside clusters as a platform of abnormal Abeta deposition in the pathology of AD.

25403907|t|Haptoglobin modulates beta-amyloid uptake by U-87 MG astrocyte cell line.
25403907|a|Accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in the extracellular space, which is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), depends on the balance between its synthesis and clearance. The physiological role of extracellular chaperones, capable of affecting early events in the amyloid cascade, is increasingly being investigated by many research groups. Among these proteins, we focused on haptoglobin, which we recently found to form a complex with beta-amyloid in brain tissues or cerebrospinal fluids from patients with AD. We also previously reported that haptoglobin increases with age in rat hippocampus. Major aim of this study was to evaluate whether haptoglobin influences Abeta interaction with astrocytes and its internalization into these cells. Haptoglobin effect on Abeta-induced cell death was also explored. We report here that haptoglobin impairs Abeta uptake by human glioblastoma-astrocytoma cell line U-87 MG and limits the toxicity of this peptide on these cells. Of note, our data also show that Abeta can stimulate haptoglobin release by astrocyte cell lines. The study of the risk of developing AD should be focused not only on the analysis of Abeta but also on the level of critical ligands, such as haptoglobin, able to influence peptide aggregation or clearance.

25404291|t|Orientation of aromatic residues in amyloid cores: structural insights into prion fiber diversity.
25404291|a|Structural conversion of one given protein sequence into different amyloid states, resulting in distinct phenotypes, is one of the most intriguing phenomena of protein biology. Despite great efforts the structural origin of prion diversity remains elusive, mainly because amyloids are insoluble yet noncrystalline and therefore not easily amenable to traditional structural-biology methods. We investigate two different phenotypic prion strains, weak and strong, of yeast translation termination factor Sup35 with respect to angular orientation of tyrosines using polarized light spectroscopy. By applying a combination of alignment methods the degree of fiber orientation can be assessed, which allows a relatively accurate determination of the aromatic ring angles. Surprisingly, the strains show identical average orientations of the tyrosines, which are evenly spread through the amyloid core. Small variations between the two strains are related to the local environment of a fraction of tyrosines outside the core, potentially reflecting differences in fibril packing.

25404298|t|alpha(2A) adrenergic receptor promotes amyloidogenesis through disrupting APP-SorLA interaction.
25404298|a|Accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides in the brain is the key pathogenic factor driving Alzheimer's disease (AD). Endocytic sorting of amyloid precursor protein (APP) mediated by the vacuolar protein sorting (Vps10) family of receptors plays a decisive role in controlling the outcome of APP proteolytic processing and Abeta generation. Here we report for the first time to our knowledge that this process is regulated by a G protein-coupled receptor, the alpha(2A) adrenergic receptor (alpha(2A)AR). Genetic deficiency of the alpha(2A)AR significantly reduces, whereas stimulation of this receptor enhances, Abeta generation and AD-related pathology. Activation of alpha(2A)AR signaling disrupts APP interaction with a Vps10 family receptor, sorting-related receptor with A repeat (SorLA), in cells and in the mouse brain. As a consequence, activation of alpha(2A)AR reduces Golgi localization of APP and concurrently promotes APP distribution in endosomes and cleavage by beta secretase. The alpha(2A)AR is a key component of the brain noradrenergic system. Profound noradrenergic dysfunction occurs consistently in patients at the early stages of AD. alpha(2A)AR-promoted Abeta generation provides a novel mechanism underlying the connection between noradrenergic dysfunction and AD. Our study also suggests alpha(2A)AR as a previously unappreciated therapeutic target for AD. Significantly, pharmacological blockade of the alpha(2A)AR by a clinically used antagonist reduces AD-related pathology and ameliorates cognitive deficits in an AD transgenic model, suggesting that repurposing clinical alpha(2A)R antagonists would be an effective therapeutic strategy for AD.

25404520|t|Prothymosin alpha variants isolated from CD8+ T cells and cervicovaginal fluid suppress HIV-1 replication through type I interferon induction.
25404520|a|Soluble factors from CD8(+) T cells and cervicovaginal mucosa of women are recognized as important in controlling human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and transmission. Previously, we have shown the strong anti-HIV-1 activity of prothymosin alpha (ProTalpha) derived from CD8(+) T cells. ProTalpha is a small acidic protein with wide cell distribution, to which several functions have been ascribed, depending on its intracellular or extracellular localization. To date, activities of ProTalpha have been attributed to a single protein known as isoform 2. Here we report the isolation and identification of 2 new ProTalpha variants from CD8(+) T cells and cervicovaginal lavage with potent anti-HIV-1 activity. The first is a splice variant of the ProTalpha gene, known as isoform CRA_b, and the second is the product of a ProTalpha gene, thus far classified as a pseudogene 7. Native or recombinant ProTalpha variants potently restrict HIV-1 replication in macrophages through the induction of type I interferon. The baseline expression of interferon-responsive genes in primary human cervical tissues positively correlate with high levels of intracellular ProTalpha, and the knockdown of ProTalpha variants by small interfering RNA leads to downregulation of interferon target genes. Overall, these findings suggest that ProTalpha variants are innate immune mediators involved in immune surveillance.

25405650|t|Clearing the amyloid in Alzheimer's: progress towards earlier diagnosis and effective treatments - an update for clinicians.
25405650|a|A beta (Abeta or beta-amyloid) is a key molecule in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. According to the 'amyloid hypothesis', the gradual accumulation of Abeta triggers events which results in neuronal loss in regions of the brain involved with memory and learning. Diverse agents have been developed to reduce brain Abeta accumulation or to enhance its clearance. Some have progressed to human trials, however all have failed to improve cognition in patients. This has led researchers to question whether Abeta is really the problem. However, the trials have been targeting end stages of AD, by which stage extensive irreversible neuronal damage has already occurred. Intervention is required preclinically, therefore preclinical AD biomarkers are needed. In this regard, amyloid imaging and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers are leading the way, with plasma biomarkers and eye tests also being investigated. This review covers the current state of knowledge of Abeta as an early diagnostic biomarker and as a therapeutic target in AD.

25405944|t|Effects of Beta-Amyloid on Resting State Functional Connectivity Within and Between Networks Reflect Known Patterns of Regional Vulnerability.
25405944|a|Beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it is also present in some cognitively normal elderly adults and may represent a preclinical disease state. While AD patients exhibit disrupted functional connectivity (FC) both within and between resting-state networks, studies of preclinical cases have focused primarily on the default mode network (DMN). The extent to which Abeta-related effects occur outside of the DMN and between networks remains unclear. In the present study, we examine how within- and between-network FC are related to both global and regional Abeta deposition as measured by [(11)C]PIB-PET in 92 cognitively normal older people. We found that within-network FC changes occurred in multiple networks, including the DMN. Changes of between-network FC were also apparent, suggesting that regions maintaining connections to multiple networks may be particularly susceptible to Abeta-induced alterations. Cortical regions showing altered FC clustered in parietal and temporal cortex, areas known to be susceptible to AD pathology. These results likely represent a mix of local network disruption, compensatory reorganization, and impaired control network function. They indicate the presence of Abeta-related dysfunction of neural systems in cognitively normal people well before these areas become hypometabolic with the onset of cognitive decline.

25406316|t|Small liposomes accelerate the fibrillation of amyloid beta (1-40).
25406316|a|The deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer disease. Abeta peptides were previously considered to interact specifically with ganglioside-containing membranes. Several studies have suggested that Abeta peptides also bind to phosphatidylcholine membranes, which lead to deformation of membranes and fibrillation of Abeta. Moreover, the role of membrane curvature, one type of deformation produced by binding of proteins to a membrane, in the binding and fibrillation of Abeta remains unclear. To clearly understand the relationship between the binding, consequent membrane deformation, and fibrillation of Abeta, we examined the amyloid fibrillation of Abeta-(1-40) in the presence of liposomes of various sizes. Membrane curvature increased with a decrease in the size of the liposomes. We used liposomes made of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine to eliminate electrostatic effects. The results obtained showed that liposomes of smaller sizes (<=50 nm) significantly accelerated the nucleation step, thereby shortening the lag time of fibrillation. On the other hand, liposomes of larger sizes decreased the amount of fibrils but did not notably affect the lag time. The morphologies of fibrils, which were monitored by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy, revealed that the length of Abeta-(1-40) fibrils became shorter and the amount of amorphous aggregates became larger as liposomes increased in size. These results suggest that the curvature of membranes coupled with an increase in water-accessible hydrophobic regions is important for binding and concentrating Abeta monomers, leading to amyloid nucleation. Furthermore, amyloid fibrillation on membranes may compete with non-productive binding to produce amorphous aggregates.

25406318|t|Cytoplasmic fragment of Alcadein alpha generated by regulated intramembrane proteolysis enhances amyloid beta-protein precursor (APP) transport into the late secretory pathway and facilitates APP cleavage.
25406318|a|The neural type I membrane protein Alcadein alpha (Alcalpha), is primarily cleaved by amyloid beta-protein precursor (APP) alpha-secretase to generate a membrane-associated carboxyl-terminal fragment (Alcalpha CTF), which is further cleaved by gamma-secretase to secrete p3-Alcalpha peptides and generate an intracellular cytoplasmic domain fragment (Alcalpha ICD) in the late secretory pathway. By association with the neural adaptor protein X11L (X11-like), Alcalpha and APP form a ternary complex that suppresses the cleavage of both Alcalpha and APP by regulating the transport of these membrane proteins into the late secretory pathway where secretases are active. However, it has not been revealed how Alcalpha and APP are directed from the ternary complex formed largely in the Golgi into the late secretory pathway to reach a nerve terminus. Using a novel transgenic mouse line expressing excess amounts of human Alcalpha CTF (hAlcalpha CTF) in neurons, we found that expression of hAlcalpha CTF induced excess production of hAlcalpha ICD, which facilitated APP transport into the nerve terminus and enhanced APP metabolism, including Abeta generation. In vitro cell studies also demonstrated that excess expression of Alcalpha ICD released both APP and Alcalpha from the ternary complex. These results indicate that regulated intramembrane proteolysis of Alcalpha by gamma-secretase regulates APP trafficking and the production of Abeta in vivo.

25407337|t|Models of beta-amyloid induced Tau-pathology: the long and "folded" road to understand the mechanism.
25407337|a|The amyloid cascade hypothesis has been the prevailing hypothesis in Alzheimer's Disease research, although the final and most wanted proof i.e. fully successful anti-amyloid clinical trials in patients, is still lacking. This may require a better in depth understanding of the cascade. Particularly, the exact toxic forms of Abeta and Tau, the molecular link between them and their respective contributions to the disease process need to be identified in detail. Although the lack of final proof has raised substantial criticism on the hypothesis per se, accumulating experimental evidence in in vitro models, in vivo models and from biomarkers analysis in patients supports the amyloid cascade and particularly Abeta-induced Tau-pathology, which is the focus of this review. We here discuss available models that recapitulate Abeta-induced Tau-pathology and review some potential underlying mechanisms. The availability and diversity of these models that mimic the amyloid cascade partially or more complete, provide tools to study remaining questions, which are crucial for development of therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's Disease.

25407821|t|Inhibiting beta-amyloid-associated Alzheimer's pathogenesis in vitro and in vivo by a multifunctional dimeric bis(12)-hupyridone derived from its natural analogue.
25407821|a|Fibrillar aggregates of beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) is the main constituent of senile plaques and considered to be one of the causative events in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Compounds that could inhibit the formation of Abeta fibrils and block Abeta fibrils-associated toxicity may have therapeutic potential to combat AD. Bis(12)-hupyridone (B12H) is a multifunctional homodimer derived from huperzine A, which is an anti-AD drug in China. In the current study, the inhibitory effect of B12H on the formation of Abeta fibrils and their associated toxicity was investigated both in vitro and in vivo. By using Thioflavin T fluorescence assay, we found that B12H (0.3-3 muM) directly inhibited Abeta fibrils formation following co-incubation of B12H and Abeta1-40 at 37  C for 6 days in vitro. However, huperzine A, at the same concentrations, did not show significant inhibitory effect on Abeta1-40 fibrils formation. Moreover, B12H markedly reduced Abeta1-40-induced cytotoxicity in cultured SH-SY5Y cells, as evidenced by the increase in cell viability, the decrease in lactate dehydrogenase release, and the reduction of apoptotic nuclei. Most importantly, B12H (0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg) reduced intracerebroventricular Abeta1-40 infusion-induced cognitive and memory impairments in rats, as evidenced by the decrease in escape latency and the increase in the spatial bias in Morris water maze test along with increasing choline acetyltransferase activity and decreasing acetylcholinesterase activity. Collectively, our study provided novel sights into the potential application of B12H in AD treatment.

25409492|a|The design of small molecules that can target the aggregation of Abeta as potential therapeutic agents for Alzheimer's disease is an area of study that has attracted a lot of attention recently. The novel ligand methyl 1-butyl-2-pyridyl-benzimidazole carboxylate was prepared for the synthesis of a series of new iridium(III), ruthenium(II), and platinum(II) 2-pyridyl-benzimidazole complexes. The crystal structure of the half-sandwich iridium(III) complex was established by X-ray diffraction. An arrangement of two cationic complexes in the unit cell is observed, and it seems to be organized by weak pi   pi interactions that are taking place between two symmetry-related benzimidazole ring systems. All new compounds inhibited aggregation of Abeta1-42 in vitro as shown by both thioflavin T fluorescence assay and transmission electron microscopy. Among them the Ir compound rescued the toxicity of Abeta1-42 in primary cortical neurons effectively.

25410807|t|The aggregation of abeta42 induced by nano copper and the antagonistic action of polysaccharides.
25410807|a|The toxic effect of Abeta42 induced by copper nanoparticle (Cu NPs) was studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM), circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, and Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence technique. Five hundred nanometers of copper nanoparticle capped with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was used to evaluate the aggregation and fibrils of Abeta42. The morphologies of Abeta42 incubated in the presence of Cu NPs changed gradually. The aggregation and fibrils were observed in AFM images. However, in the presence of polysaccharides, the Cu NPs-induced fibrillation of Abeta42 was inhibited. Interestingly, the formed Cu NPs-polysaccharides complexes can even remodel the preformed Abeta42 fibrils into the low neurotoxic amorphous aggregates, which were maybe ascribed to the higher affinity of polysaccharides for Abeta42 than Cu NPs. Besides, it was found that the binding constant of Cu NPs to Abeta42 is smaller than that of polysaccharides. The relationship among polysaccharides, copper nanoparticle, and Abeta42 morphologies and its neurotoxicity were discussed, and the binding force was analyzed.

25411290|t|A comprehensive linear programming tool to optimize formulations of ready-to-use therapeutic foods: an application to Ethiopia.
25411290|a|BACKGROUND: Ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) is the standard of care for children suffering from noncomplicated severe acute malnutrition (SAM). OBJECTIVE: The objective was to develop a comprehensive linear programming (LP) tool to create novel RUTF formulations for Ethiopia. DESIGN: A systematic approach that surveyed international and national crop and animal food databases was used to create a global and local candidate ingredient database. The database included information about each ingredient regarding nutrient composition, ingredient category, regional availability, and food safety, processing, and price. An LP tool was then designed to compose novel RUTF formulations. For the example case of Ethiopia, the objective was to minimize the ingredient cost of RUTF; the decision variables were ingredient weights and the extent of use of locally available ingredients, and the constraints were nutritional and product-quality related. RESULTS: Of the new RUTF formulations found by the LP tool for Ethiopia, 32 were predicted to be feasible for creating a paste, and these were prepared in the laboratory. Palatable final formulations contained a variety of ingredients, including fish, different dairy powders, and various seeds, grains, and legumes. Nearly all of the macronutrient values calculated by the LP tool differed by <10% from results produced by laboratory analyses, but the LP tool consistently underestimated total energy. CONCLUSIONS: The LP tool can be used to develop new RUTF formulations that make more use of locally available ingredients. This tool has the potential to lead to production of a variety of low-cost RUTF formulations that meet international standards and thereby potentially allow more children to be treated for SAM.

25411915|a|A series of 2,3,4,4a,10,10a-hexahydropyrano[3,2-b]chromene analogs was developed that demonstrated high selectivity (>2000-fold) for BACE1 vs Cathepsin D (CatD). Three different Asp-binding moieties were examined: spirocyclic acyl guanidines, aminooxazolines, and aminothiazolines in order to modulate potency, selectivity, efflux, and permeability. Guided by structure based design, changes to P2' and P3 moieties were explored. A conformationally restricted P2' methyl group provided inhibitors with excellent cell potency (37-137 nM) and selectivity (435 to >2000-fold) for BACE1 vs CatD. These efforts lead to compound 59, which demonstrated a 69% reduction in rat CSF Abeta1-40 at 60 mg/kg (PO).

25412207|t|Epidemic spreading model to characterize misfolded proteins propagation in aging and associated neurodegenerative disorders.
25412207|a|Misfolded proteins (MP) are a key component in aging and associated neurodegenerative disorders. For example, misfolded Amyloid-ss (Ass) and tau proteins are two neuropathogenic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Mechanisms underlying intra-brain MP propagation/deposition remain essentially uncharacterized. Here, is introduced an epidemic spreading model (ESM) for MP dynamics that considers propagation-like interactions between MP agents and the brain's clearance response across the structural connectome. The ESM reproduces advanced Ass deposition patterns in the human brain (explaining 46~56% of the variance in regional Ass loads, in 733 subjects from the ADNI database). Furthermore, this model strongly supports a) the leading role of Ass clearance deficiency and early Ass onset age during Alzheimer's disease progression, b) that effective anatomical distance from Ass outbreak region explains regional Ass arrival time and Ass deposition likelihood, c) the multi-factorial impact of APOE e4 genotype, gender and educational level on lifetime intra-brain Ass propagation, and d) the modulatory impact of Ass propagation history on tau proteins concentrations, supporting the hypothesis of an interrelated pathway between Ass pathophysiology and tauopathy. To our knowledge, the ESM is the first computational model highlighting the direct link between structural brain networks, production/clearance of pathogenic proteins and associated intercellular transfer mechanisms, individual genetic/demographic properties and clinical states in health and disease. In sum, the proposed ESM constitutes a promising framework to clarify intra-brain region to region transference mechanisms associated with aging and neurodegenerative disorders.

25412393|t|Bladder cancer collaborative stage variables and their data quality, usage, and clinical implications: a review of SEER data, 2004-2010.
25412393|a|BACKGROUND: Several changes were made to bladder cancer staging guidelines between the 6th and 7th editions of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Staging Manual. Also, Collaborative Stage (CS) Data Collection System version 2 (CSv2) implemented for 2010 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cases involved collection of 3 new site-specific factors (SSFs): World Health Organization/International Society of Urological pathology grade (SSF1), size of metastasis in regional lymph nodes (SSF2), and extranodal extension (SSF3). Our objective was to evaluate these new SSFs to assist researchers in their use/interpretation and to describe data quality issues to be addressed moving forward. METHODS: Staging trends were assessed for invasive and noninvasive bladder cancer cases from 2004 to 2010. Among 2010 cases, staging was compared using the AJCC 6th and 7th edition guidelines, and evaluation of completeness/quality of the SSFs was performed in relevant subgroups. RESULTS: Age-adjusted incidence rates and proportions of cases by stage remained steady from 2004 to 2010. Changes from the AJCC 6th to 7th editions caused no substantial movement between stages. SSF1 had a known value in 82% of cases, which was higher than the traditional SEER grade/differentiation variable. SSF2 and SSF3 were less complete, with 41% and 37% having known values, respectively, among cases with lymph node involvement (according to CS lymph node variable). CONCLUSIONS: SSF1 was more complete and straightforward to interpret than the traditional grade/differentiation variable. SSF2 and SSF3 were less complete, may be associated with data quality issues, and should only be used among cases with known lymph node involvement.

25414381|t|Amyloid-beta and depression in healthy older adults: a systematic review.
25414381|a|OBJECTIVE: Depression has been shown to be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and in older adults may provide a marker for the beginning of the prodromal phase of AD. The purpose of this systematic review is to examine the relationship between amyloid-beta (Abeta), a key biomarker of AD, and depression in older adults. METHOD: The literature search was limited to studies conducted from 2006 to 2014 that were published in English in peer-reviewed journals. Studies were selected if they included a group of older adults who either met established criteria for Major Depressive Disorder or Dysthymia; or were assessed for depressive symptoms on a standardised measure. Studies were also required to include an outcome variable that was a direct measure of Abeta levels in either blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples, or via neuroimaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET). RESULTS: Nineteen studies were identified, 15 of which found significant differences in Abeta levels between depressed and non-depressed older adults. However, studies were limited by their cross-sectional design, reliance on blood-based measures of Abeta, and potential sample bias. CONCLUSIONS: Future investigations should consider prospective longitudinal design using neuroimaging and CSF measures of Abeta.

25415602|t|Microspectroscopy (muFTIR) reveals co-localization of lipid oxidation and amyloid plaques in human Alzheimer disease brains.
25415602|a|Amyloid peptides are the main component of one of the characteristic pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD): senile plaques. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, amyloid peptides may play a central role in the sequence of events that leads to neurodegeneration. However, there are other factors, such as oxidative stress, that may be crucial for the development of the disease. In the present paper, we show that it is possible, by using Fourier tranform infrared (FTIR) microscopy, to co-localize amyloid deposits and lipid peroxidation in tissue slides from patients affected by Alzheimer's disease. Plaques and lipids can be analyzed in the same sample, making use of the characteristic infrared bands for peptide aggregation and lipid oxidation. The results show that, in samples from patients diagnosed with AD, the plaques and their immediate surroundings are always characterized by the presence of oxidized lipids. As for samples from non-AD individuals, those without amyloid plaques show a lower level of lipid oxidation than AD individuals. However, it is known that plaques can be detected in the brains of some non-AD individuals. Our results show that, in such cases, the lipid in the plaques and their surroundings display oxidation levels that are similar to those of tissues with no plaques. These results point to lipid oxidation as a possible key factor in the path that goes from showing the typical neurophatological hallmarks to suffering from dementia. In this process, the oxidative power of the amyloid peptide, possibly in the form of nonfibrillar aggregates, could play a central role.

25417150|t|Lessons from a failed gamma-secretase Alzheimer trial.
25417150|a|gamma-Secretase proteases have been associated with pathology in Alzheimer disease (AD), but we are just beginning to understand their basic mechanisms and physiological roles. A negative drug trial with a broad spectrum gamma-secretase inhibitor in AD patients has severely dampened enthusiasm for the potential of pursuing gamma-secretase research therapeutically. This pessimism is unwarranted: analysis of available information presented here demonstrates significant confounds for interpreting the outcome of the trial and argues that the major lessons pertain to broad knowledge gaps that are imperative to fill.

25418871|t|Nutraceuticals and amyloid neurodegenerative diseases: a focus on natural phenols.
25418871|a|A common molecular feature of amyloid neurodegenerative diseases is the unfolding/misfolding of specific proteins/peptides which consequently become prone to aggregate into toxic assemblies and deposits that are the key histopathological trait of these pathologies. Apart from the rare early-onset familiar forms, these neurodegenerative diseases are age-associated disorders whose symptoms appear in aged people after long incubation periods. This makes the therapeutic approach particularly compelling and boosts the search for both early diagnostic tools and preventive approaches. In this last respect, natural compounds commonly present in foods and beverages are considered promising molecules, at least on the bench side. The so-called 'nutraceutical approach' suggests life-long healthy diets, particularly focusing on food molecules that are candidates to enter clinical trials as such or following a targeted molecular engineering. Natural phenols abundant in 'healthy' foods such as extra virgin olive oil, red wine, green tea, red berries and spices, appear particularly promising.

25419706|t|A rare mutation in UNC5C predisposes to late-onset Alzheimer's disease and increases neuronal cell death.
25419706|a|We have identified a rare coding mutation, T835M (rs137875858), in the UNC5C netrin receptor gene that segregated with disease in an autosomal dominant pattern in two families enriched for late-onset Alzheimer's disease and that was associated with disease across four large case-control cohorts (odds ratio = 2.15, Pmeta = 0.0095). T835M alters a conserved residue in the hinge region of UNC5C, and in vitro studies demonstrate that this mutation leads to increased cell death in human HEK293T cells and in rodent neurons. Furthermore, neurons expressing T835M UNC5C are more susceptible to cell death from multiple neurotoxic stimuli, including beta-amyloid (Abeta), glutamate and staurosporine. On the basis of these data and the enriched hippocampal expression of UNC5C in the adult nervous system, we propose that one possible mechanism in which T835M UNC5C contributes to the risk of Alzheimer's disease is by increasing susceptibility to neuronal cell death, particularly in vulnerable regions of the Alzheimer's disease brain.

25421004|t|Positive peritoneal cytology at interval surgery is a poor prognostic factor in patients with stage T3c advanced ovarian carcinoma: A retrospective study.
25421004|a|AIM: The purpose of our study is to investigate clinically significant prognostic factors at the time of interval surgery (IS), comprising interval look surgery and interval debulking surgery, for T3c (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IIIc to IV) advanced ovarian cancer (AOC) patients during primary treatment. METHODS: We reviewed records of patients with T3c AOC who underwent IS following neoadjuvant chemotherapy or up-front primary debulking surgery with adjuvant chemotherapy at our institution between January 1996 and December 2010. For analysis of prognostic factors, cytology of peritoneal exfoliative cells at IS was added to clinicopathological variables. RESULTS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 50 cases. The median age was 61.1 years (range, 38-78), with median follow-up of 45.9 months (range, 12-122). Macroscopic tumors were completely resected in 32 cases (64%) at IS. Univariate analyses of clinicopathological factors for IS identified preoperative serum cancer antigen-125 levels (>=20 IU/mL; P = 0.0539), number of residual lesions at IS (>=20; P = 0.0554), incomplete surgery at IS (P = 0.0171) and positive peritoneal cytology at IS (P = 0.0015) as significant factors for prognosis regarding progression-free survival (PFS). Multivariate analysis identified positive peritoneal cytology (P = 0.0303) as a unique independent predictor of poor prognosis in PFS. CONCLUSION: Positive peritoneal cytology at IS appears to be a significant factor for poor prognosis in PFS, which may provide useful information for post-IS chemotherapy planning. IS in the treatment of AOC may be useful for not only complete resection, but also for identification of patients with poor prognosis.

25421868|t|Efficacy of naftopidil for nocturia in male patients with lower urinary tract symptoms: comparison of morning and evening dosing.
25421868|a|OBJECTIVES: To examine the difference in improvement of lower urinary tract symptoms between morning and evening dosing of alpha1 -blocker naftopidil. METHODS: A total of 177 male patients with nocturia were included in the present study and randomized to morning or evening dosing of naftopidil. The International Prostate Symptom Score, quality of life index and nocturia quality of life index were compared between the two study groups at 12 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 143 patients (morning group: n = 70, evening group: n = 73) were analyzed as a result of the dropout of 34 patients because of failure to give consent, adverse events and failure to attend. Nocturia, quality of life index and nocturia quality of life index at 12 weeks were significantly better in the evening group compared with the morning group. In a multivariate model, both the dosing time of naftopidil and the initial nocturia quality of life index were significantly associated with change in nocturia quality of life index. CONCLUSIONS: Evening dosing of naftopidil seems to be more effective in treating nocturia in male patients with lower urinary tract symptoms.

25422429|t|A common brain network links development, aging, and vulnerability to disease.
25422429|a|Several theories link processes of development and aging in humans. In neuroscience, one model posits for instance that healthy age-related brain degeneration mirrors development, with the areas of the brain thought to develop later also degenerating earlier. However, intrinsic evidence for such a link between healthy aging and development in brain structure remains elusive. Here, we show that a data-driven analysis of brain structural variation across 484 healthy participants (8-85 y) reveals a largely--but not only--transmodal network whose lifespan pattern of age-related change intrinsically supports this model of mirroring development and aging. We further demonstrate that this network of brain regions, which develops relatively late during adolescence and shows accelerated degeneration in old age compared with the rest of the brain, characterizes areas of heightened vulnerability to unhealthy developmental and aging processes, as exemplified by schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease, respectively. Specifically, this network, while derived solely from healthy subjects, spatially recapitulates the pattern of brain abnormalities observed in both schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. This network is further associated in our large-scale healthy population with intellectual ability and episodic memory, whose impairment contributes to key symptoms of schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. Taken together, our results suggest that the common spatial pattern of abnormalities observed in these two disorders, which emerge at opposite ends of the life spectrum, might be influenced by the timing of their separate and distinct pathological processes in disrupting healthy cerebral development and aging, respectively.

25422864|t|Capping of abeta42 oligomers by small molecule inhibitors.
25422864|a|Abeta42 peptides associate into soluble oligomers and protofibrils in the process of forming the amyloid fibrils associated with Alzheimer's disease. The oligomers have been reported to be more toxic to neurons than fibrils, and have been targeted by a wide range of small molecule and peptide inhibitors. With single touch atomic force microscopy (AFM), we show that monomeric Abeta42 forms two distinct types of oligomers, low molecular weight (MW) oligomers with heights of 1-2 nm and high MW oligomers with heights of 3-5 nm. In both cases, the oligomers are disc-shaped with diameters of ~10-15 nm. The similar diameters suggest that the low MW species stack to form the high MW oligomers. The ability of Abeta42 inhibitors to interact with these oligomers is probed using atomic force microscopy and NMR spectroscopy. We show that curcumin and resveratrol bind to the N-terminus (residues 5-20) of Abeta42 monomers and cap the height of the oligomers that are formed at 1-2 nm. A second class of inhibitors, which includes sulindac sulfide and indomethacin, exhibit very weak interactions across the Abeta42 sequence and do not block the formation of the high MW oligomers. The correlation between N-terminal interactions and capping of the height of the Abeta oligomers provides insights into the mechanism of inhibition and the pathway of Abeta aggregation.

25424812|t|Vaccination induced changes in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels as an early putative biomarker for cognitive improvement in a transgenic mouse model for Alzheimer disease.
25424812|a|Several pieces of experimental evidence suggest that administration of anti-beta amyloid (Abeta) vaccines, passive anti-Abeta antibodies or anti-inflammatory drugs can reduce Abeta deposition as well as associated cognitive/behavioral deficits in an Alzheimer disease (AD) transgenic (Tg) mouse model and, as such, may have some efficacy in human AD patients as well. In the investigation reported here an Abeta 1-42 peptide vaccine was administered to 16-month old APP+PS1 transgenic (Tg) mice in which Abeta deposition, cognitive memory deficits as well as levels of several pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured in response to the vaccination regimen. After vaccination, the anti-Abeta 1-42 antibody-producing mice demonstrated a significant reduction in the sera levels of 4 pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1 alpha, and IL-12). Importantly, reductions in the cytokine levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 were correlated with cognitive/behavioral improvement in the Tg mice. However, no differences in cerebral Abeta deposition in these mice were noted among the different control and experimental groups, i.e., Abeta 1-42 peptide vaccinated, control peptide vaccinated, or non-vaccinated mice. However, decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as improved cognitive performance were noted in mice vaccinated with the control peptide as well as those immunized with the Abeta 1-42 peptide. These findings suggest that reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in these mice may be utilized as an early biomarker for vaccination/treatment induced amelioration of cognitive deficits and are independent of Abeta deposition and, interestingly, antigen specific Abeta 1-42 vaccination. Since cytokine changes are typically related to T cell activation, the results imply that T cell regulation may have an important role in vaccination or other immunotherapeutic strategies in an AD mouse model and potentially in AD patients. Overall, these cytokine changes may serve as a predictive marker for AD development and progression as well as having potential therapeutic implications.

25425062|t|Low amyloid-beta deposition correlates with high education in cognitively normal older adults: a pilot study.
25425062|a|OBJECTIVE: Several epidemiological studies have found a lower incidence of Alzheimer's disease in highly educated populations, but the protective mechanism of education against the disease is still unclear. Our objective was to investigate the association between education and (11) C-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B (PIB) uptake with positron emission tomography in participants with normal cognitive ability. METHODS: We performed (11) C-labeled PIB positron emission tomography and neuropsychological testing in 30 cognitively normal older participants. Of the participants, 16 had a period of education less than 12 years (low-education group) and 14 had more than 13 years (high-education group). Amyloid-beta deposition was quantified by binding potential (BPND ) in several brain regions and was compared between the groups with different education levels. RESULTS: We found significantly higher cortical PIB-BPND in the cognitively normal participants with low education compared with the ones with high education. None of the brain regions in low-education group showed significantly lower BPND values. This finding was not affected by the inclusion of possible confounding variables such as age, sex, and general intelligence. Our findings indicated a reduced amyloid pathology in highly educated, cognitively normal, participants. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings lead to the proposal that early-life education has a negative association with Alzheimer's disease pathology. This proposal is not in opposition to the brain reserve hypothesis. People with more education might be prone to a greater inhibitory effect against amyloid-beta deposition before the preclinical stage. At the same time, they have a greater reserve capacity, and greater pathological changes are required for dementia to manifest.

25432317|t|Acute function of secreted amyloid precursor protein fragment APPsalpha in synaptic plasticity.
25432317|a|The key role of APP in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease is well established. However, postnatal lethality of double knockout mice has so far precluded the analysis of the physiological functions of APP and the APLPs in the brain. Previously, APP family proteins have been implicated in synaptic adhesion, and analysis of the neuromuscular junction of constitutive APP/APLP2 mutant mice showed deficits in synaptic morphology and neuromuscular transmission. Here, we generated animals with a conditional APP/APLP2 double knockout (cDKO) in excitatory forebrain neurons using NexCre mice. Electrophysiological recordings of adult NexCre cDKOs indicated a strong synaptic phenotype with pronounced deficits in the induction and maintenance of hippocampal LTP and impairments in paired pulse facilitation, indicating a possible presynaptic deficit. These deficits were also reflected in impairments in nesting behavior and hippocampus-dependent learning and memory tasks, including deficits in Morris water maze and radial maze performance. Moreover, while no gross alterations of brain morphology were detectable in NexCre cDKO mice, quantitative analysis of adult hippocampal CA1 neurons revealed prominent reductions in total neurite length, dendritic branching, reduced spine density and reduced spine head volume. Strikingly, the impairment of LTP could be selectively rescued by acute application of exogenous recombinant APPsalpha, but not APPsbeta, indicating a crucial role for APPsalpha to support synaptic plasticity of mature hippocampal synapses on a rapid time scale. Collectively, our analysis reveals an essential role of APP family proteins in excitatory principal neurons for mediating normal dendritic architecture, spine density and morphology, synaptic plasticity and cognition.

25432471|t|Reversing heart failure-associated pathophysiology with exercise: what actually improves and by how much?
25432471|a|Until the late 1980s, physical exercise training was a contraindication in patients with heart failure. Extensive research has demonstrated that exercise training reverses heart failure-associated pathology at the clinical and molecular levels. Exercise training has emerged as a class I recommendation in all major national and international guidelines for the treatment of chronic heart failure. Knowledge gained in clinical trials and molecular research builds a strong case for exercise training as a key therapeutic component of an evidence-based treatment of chronic heart failure. It is long overdue to provide patients with an infrastructure that enables them to benefit from this class I intervention.

25433221|t|Autophagy-related protein 7 deficiency in amyloid beta (Abeta) precursor protein transgenic mice decreases Abeta in the multivesicular bodies and induces Abeta accumulation in the Golgi.
25433221|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is biochemically characterized by increased levels of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide, which aggregates into extracellular Abeta plaques in AD brains. Before plaque formation, Abeta accumulates intracellularly in both AD brains and in the brains of AD model mice, which may contribute to disease progression. Autophagy, which is impaired in AD, clears cellular protein aggregates and participates in Abeta metabolism. In addition to a degradative role of autophagy in Abeta metabolism we recently showed that Abeta secretion is inhibited in mice lacking autophagy-related gene 7 (Atg7) in excitatory neurons in the mouse forebrain. This inhibition of Abeta secretion leads to intracellular accumulation of Abeta. Here, we used fluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy to elucidate the subcellular localization of the intracellular Abeta accumulation which accumulates in Abeta precursor protein mice lacking Atg7. Autophagy deficiency causes accumulation of p62(+) aggregates, but these aggregates do not contain Abeta. However, knockdown of Atg7 induced Abeta accumulation in the Golgi and a concomitant reduction of Abeta in the multivesicular bodies. This indicates that Atg7 influences the transport of Abeta possibly derived from Golgi to multivesicular bodies.

25433458|t|Low concentrations of ethanol protect against synaptotoxicity induced by Abeta in hippocampal neurons.
25433458|a|Epidemiological studies have reported a reduction in the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in individuals that ingest low amounts of alcohol. Also, it has been found that moderate consumption of ethanol might protect against beta-amyloid (Abeta) toxicity. However, the mechanism underlying its potential neuroprotection is largely unknown. In the present study, we found that ethanol improved the cognitive processes of learning and memory in 3xTgAD mice. In addition, we found that a low concentration of ethanol (equivalent to moderate ethanol consumption) decreased the binding of Abeta (1 and 5 muM) to neuronal membranes and, consequently, its synaptotoxic effect in rat hippocampal and cortical neurons under acute (30 minutes) and chronic (24 hours) incubation conditions. This effect appears to be exerted by a direct action of ethanol on Abeta because electron microscopy studies showed that ethanol altered the degree of Abeta aggregation. The action of ethanol on Abeta also prevented the peptide from perforating the neuronal membrane, as assayed with patch clamp experiments. Taken together, these results contribute to elucidating the mechanism by which low concentrations of ethanol protect against toxicity induced by Abeta oligomers in primary neuronal cultures. These results may also provide an explanation for the decrease in the risk of Alzheimer's disease in people who consume moderate doses of alcohol.

25435336|t|Cerebrospinal fluid cortisol and clinical disease progression in MCI and dementia of Alzheimer's type.
25435336|a|Increased peripheral and central nervous system cortisol levels have been reported in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may reflect dysfunction of cerebral components of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. However, brain exposure to high cortisol concentrations may also accelerate disease progression and cognitive decline. The objectives of this study were to investigate whether HPA-axis dysregulation occurs at early clinical stages of AD and whether plasma and CSF cortisol levels are associated with clinical disease progression. Morning plasma and CSF cortisol concentrations were obtained from the subjects with AD dementia, mild cognitive impairment of AD type (MCI-AD), MCI of other type (MCI-O), and controls with normal cognition included in a multicenter study from the German Dementia Competence Network. A clinical and neuropsychological follow-up was performed in a subgroup of participants with MCI-AD, MCI-O, and AD dementia. CSF cortisol concentrations were increased in the subjects with AD dementia or MCI-AD compared with subjects with MCI-O or normal cognition. After controlling for possible confounders including CSF measures of amyloid beta1-42 and total tau, higher baseline CSF cortisol levels were associated with faster clinical worsening and cognitive decline in MCI-AD. The findings suggest that HPA-axis dysregulation occurs at the MCI stage of AD and may accelerate disease progression and cognitive decline.

25436414|t|A potential function for neuronal exosomes: sequestering intracerebral amyloid-beta peptide.
25436414|a|Elevated amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) in brain contributes to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. We demonstrated the presence of exosome-associated Abeta in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of cynomolgus monkeys and APP transgenic mice. The levels of exosome-associated Abeta notably decreased in the CSF of aging animals. We also determined that neuronal exosomes, but not glial exosomes, had abundant glycosphingolipids and could capture Abeta. Infusion of neuronal exosomes into brains of APP transgenic mice decreased Abeta and amyloid depositions, similarly to what reported previously on neuroblastoma-derived exosomes. These findings highlight the role of neuronal exosomes in Abeta clearance, and suggest that their downregulation might relate to Abeta accumulation and, ultimately, the development of AD pathology.

25440885|t|Gadolinium-based contrast agents targeted to amyloid aggregates for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease by MRI.
25440885|a|While important efforts were made in the development of positron emission tomography (PET) tracers for the in vivo molecular diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, very few investigations to develop magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) probes were performed. Here, a new generation of Gd(III)-based contrast agents (CAs) is proposed to detect the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) aggregates by MRI, one of the earliest biological hallmarks of the pathology. A building block strategy was used to synthesize a library of 16 CAs to investigate structure-activity relationships (SARs) on physicochemical properties and binding affinity for the Abeta aggregates. Three types of blocks were used to modulate the CA structures: (i) the Gd(III) chelates (Gd(III)-DOTA and Gd(III)-PCTA), (ii) the biovectors (2-arylbenzothiazole, 2-arylbenzoxazole and stilbene derivatives) and (iii) the linkers (neutrals, positives and negatives with several lengths). These investigations revealed unexpected SARs and a difficulty of these probes to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). General insights for the development of Gd(III)-based CAs to detect the Abeta aggregates are described.

25442939|t|The evolution of preclinical Alzheimer's disease: implications for prevention trials.
25442939|a|As the field begins to test the concept of a "preclinical" stage of neurodegenerative disease, when the pathophysiological process has begun in the brain, but clinical symptoms are not yet manifest, a number of intriguing questions have already arisen. In particular, in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD), the temporal relationship of amyloid markers to markers of neurodegeneration and their relative utility in the prediction of cognitive decline among clinically normal older individuals remains to be fully elucidated. Secondary prevention trials in AD have already begun in both genetic at-risk and amyloid at-risk cohorts, with several more trials in the planning stages, and should provide critical answers about whether intervention at this very early stage of disease can truly bend the curve of clinical progression. This review will highlight recent progress in cognitive, imaging, and biomarker outcomes in the field of preclinical AD, and the remaining gaps in knowledge.

25443857|t|The Centiloid Project: standardizing quantitative amyloid plaque estimation by PET.
25443857|a|Although amyloid imaging with PiB-PET ([C-11]Pittsburgh Compound-B positron emission tomography), and now with F-18-labeled tracers, has produced remarkably consistent qualitative findings across a large number of centers, there has been considerable variability in the exact numbers reported as quantitative outcome measures of tracer retention. In some cases this is as trivial as the choice of units, in some cases it is scanner dependent, and of course, different tracers yield different numbers. Our working group was formed to standardize quantitative amyloid imaging measures by scaling the outcome of each particular analysis method or tracer to a 0 to 100 scale, anchored by young controls (<= 45 years) and typical Alzheimer's disease patients. The units of this scale have been named "Centiloids." Basically, we describe a "standard" method of analyzing PiB PET data and then a method for scaling any "nonstandard" method of PiB PET analysis (or any other tracer) to the Centiloid scale.

25444575|t|The Study of Mental and Resistance Training (SMART) study:resistance training and/or cognitive training in mild cognitive impairment: a randomized, double-blind, double-sham controlled trial.
25444575|a|BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) increases dementia risk with no pharmacologic treatment available. METHODS: The Study of Mental and Resistance Training was a randomized, double-blind, double-sham controlled trial of adults with MCI. Participants were randomized to 2 supervised interventions: active or sham physical training (high intensity progressive resistance training vs seated calisthenics) plus active or sham cognitive training (computerized, multidomain cognitive training vs watching videos/quizzes), 2-3 days/week for 6 months with 18-month follow-up. Primary outcomes were global cognitive function (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale; ADAS-Cog) and functional independence (Bayer Activities of Daily Living). Secondary outcomes included executive function, memory, and speed/attention tests, and cognitive domain scores. RESULTS: One hundred adults with MCI [70.1 (6.7) years; 68% women] were enrolled and analyzed. Resistance training significantly improved the primary outcome ADAS-Cog; [relative effect size (95% confidence interval) -0.33 (-0.73, 0.06); P < .05] at 6 months and executive function (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Matrices; P = .016) across 18 months. Normal ADAS-Cog scores occurred in 48% (24/49) after resistance training vs 27% (14/51) without resistance training [P < .03; odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 3.50 (1.18, 10.48)]. Cognitive training only attenuated decline in Memory Domain at 6 months (P < .02). Resistance training 18-month benefit was 74% higher (P = .02) for Executive Domain compared with combined training [z-score change = 0.42 (0.22, 0.63) resistance training vs 0.11 (-0.60, 0.28) combined] and 48% higher (P < .04) for Global Domain [z-score change = .0.45 (0.29, 0.61) resistance training vs 0.23 (0.10, 0.36) combined]. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance training significantly improved global cognitive function, with maintenance of executive and global benefits over 18 months.

25444609|t|Storm before the quiet: neuronal hyperactivity and Abeta in the presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease.
25444609|a|Neuronal activity directly promotes the production and secretion of amyloid beta (Abeta). Interestingly, neuronal hyperactivity can be observed in presymptomatic stages of both sporadic and familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in several AD mouse models. In this review, we will highlight the recent evidence for neuronal hyperactivity before or during the onset of cognitive defects in mild cognitive impairment. Furthermore, we review specific molecular mechanisms through which neuronal hyperactivity affects Abeta production and degradation. With these data, we will provide more insight into the 2-faced nature of neuronal hyperactivity: does enhanced neuronal activity during the presymptomatic stages of AD provide protection against the earliest disease processes or is it a pathogenic contributor to AD?

25444865|t|Tenuifolin, a secondary saponin from hydrolysates of polygalasaponins, counteracts the neurotoxicity induced by Abeta25-35 peptides in vitro and in vivo.
25444865|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with damage to hippocampal neurons and declines in cognitive functions. The accumulation of amyloid peptides is regarded as a crucial event in the initiation of AD. The neurotoxicity induced by Abeta25-35 peptides was used to screen for cytoprotective factors in vitro, and the cognitive deficits induced by the injection of Abeta25-35 into the hippocampus were used to evaluate effect on learning and memory. Our previous study revealed that hydrolysate of polygalasaponins (HPS) clearly improve the cognitive deficits induced by the injection of Abeta25-35 in mice, but the potential active constituent of HPS remains unclear. The purposes of this study were to separate and purify the secondary saponins of HPS, screen for neuroprotective effects of the constituents in vitro, and to evaluate the effect of cognition in vivo. Various chromatographic methods were used to separate and purify the HPS. The neuroprotective effects were examined in Abeta25-35-damage-induced PC12 cells. The protective effect of tenuifolin on the cognitive impairments induced by Abeta25-35 injection was assessed using the Morris water maze and step-through passive avoidance tests. Tenuifolin and fallaxsaponin A were isolated from the HPS. Tenuifolin possessed neuroprotective effects against Abeta25-35-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells and significantly improved the cognitive deficits induced by the intrahippocampal injection of Abeta25-35 in mice. Thus, tenuifolin is one of the active constituents of HPS against the neurotoxicity induced by Abeta25-35 peptides in vitro and in vivo.

25445365|t|Intranasal deferoxamine engages multiple pathways to decrease memory loss in the APP/PS1 model of amyloid accumulation.
25445365|a|In addition to the hallmark accumulation of amyloid and hyper-phosphorylation of tau, brain changes in Alzheimer's disease are multifactorial including inflammation, oxidative stress, and metal dysregulation. Metal chelators have been explored as a less well known approach to treatment. One chelator currently being developed is deferoxamine (DFO), administered via the intranasal (IN) route. In the current study, APP/PS1 amyloid mice were treated with a chronic, low dose of IN DFO, subjected to a rigorous battery of behavior tests, and the mechanism of action was examined. Mice were treated 3x/week with 0.24 C IN DFO for 18 weeks from 36 to 54 weeks of age, 4 weeks of behavior tests were performed that included both working and reference memory, anxiolytic and motor behaviors, and finally brain tissues were analyzed for amyloid, protein oxidation, and other proteins affected by DFO. We found that IN DFO treatment significantly decreased loss of both reference and working memory in the Morris and radial arm water mazes (p < 0.05), and also decreased soluble Abeta40 and Abeta42 in cortex and hippocampus (p < 0.05). Further, IN DFO decreased activity of GSK3beta, and led to decreases in oxidative stress (p < 0.05). These data demonstrate that low doses of IN DFO can modify several targets along the multiple pathways implicated in the neuropathology of Alzheimer's, making it an attractive candidate for the treatment of this heterogeneous disease.

25445965|t|5-Hydroxymethylfurfural, an antioxidant agent from Alpinia oxyphylla Miq. improves cognitive impairment in Abeta 1-42 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
25445965|a|5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) is a main effective compound of Alpinia oxyphylla Miq. ethanol extract, which showed memory improvement activity against Alzheimer's disease in previous study. In order to identify a potential therapeutic agent, the neuroprotective effects of 5-HMF on impairment of cognition and memory function induced by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of Abeta 1-42 were investigated in vivo. The mice were treated with 5-HMF at dose of 15 mug/kg and 150 mug/kg (ICV) for five consecutive days after ICV-Abeta 1-42. The results showed that 5-HMF significantly ameliorated learning and memory impairment evaluated by the locomotor activity, Y-maze test, and Morris water maze test. Furthermore, 5-HMF significantly inhibited the beta-secretase activity, decreased the content of Abeta 1-42 and malondialdehyde (MDA), and increased the antioxidative enzyme activities including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Results of hippocampus slices showed that neuronal were integrated and regularly arranged in the groups which were administered along with 5-HMF, indicating that 5-HMF could mitigate the degree of neuronal damage. The present study indicated that 5-HMF may serve as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

25446617|t|Transcriptional profile of HIV-induced nuclear translocation of amyloid beta in brain endothelial cells.
25446617|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Increased amyloid deposition in HIV-infected brains may contribute to the pathogenesis of neurocognitive dysfunction in infected patients. We have previously shown that exposure to HIV results in enhanced amyloid beta (Abeta) levels in human brain microvascular endothelial cells, suggesting that brain endothelial cells contribute to accumulation of Abeta in HIV-infected brains. Importantly, Abeta not only accumulates in the cytoplasm of HIV-exposed cells but also enters the nuclei of brain endothelial cells. METHODS: cDNA microarray analysis was performed in order to examine changes in the transcriptional profile associated with Abeta nuclear entry in the presence of HIV-1. RESULTS: Gene network analysis indicated that inhibition of nuclear entry of Abeta resulted in enrichment in gene sets involved in apoptosis and survival, endoplasmic reticulum stress response, immune response, cell cycle, DNA damage, oxidative stress, cytoskeleton remodeling and transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) receptor signaling. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained data indicate that HIV-induced Abeta nuclear uptake affects several cellular stress-related pathways relevant for HIV-induced Abeta pathology.

25446741|t|Cognitive and emotional alterations in young Alzheimer's disease (3xTgAD) mice: effects of neonatal handling stimulation and sexual dimorphism.
25446741|a|Alzheimer disease is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and cause of senile dementia. It is characterized by an accelerated memory loss, and alterations of mood, reason, judgment and language. The main neuropathological hallmarks of the disorder are beta-amyloid (betaA) plaques and neurofibrillary Tau tangles. The triple transgenic 3xTgAD mouse model develops betaA and Tau pathologies in a progressive manner which mimicks the pattern that takes place in the human brain with AD, and showing cognitive alterations characteristic of the disease. The present study intended to examine whether 3xTgAD mice of both sexes present cognitive, emotional and other behavioral alterations at the early age of 4 months, an age in which only some intraneuronal amyloid accumulation is found. Neonatal handling (H) is an early-life treatment known to produce profound and long-lasting behavioral and neurobiological effects in rodents, as well as improvements in cognitive functions. Therefore, we also aimed at evaluating the effects of H on the behavioral/cognitive profile of 4-month-old male and female 3xTgAD mice. The results indicate that, (1) 3xTgAD mice present spatial learning/memory deficits and emotional alterations already at the early age of 4 months, (2) there exists sexual dimorphism effects on several behavioral variables at this age, (3) neonatal handling exerts a preventive effect on some cognitive (spatial learning) and emotional alterations appearing in 3xTgAD mice already at early ages, and 4) H treatment appears to produce stronger positive effects in females than in males in several spatial learning measures and in the open field test.

25446751|t|B2 receptor blockage prevents Abeta-induced cognitive impairment by neuroinflammation inhibition.
25446751|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Abeta-induced neuronal toxicity and memory loss is thought to be dependent on neuroinflammation, an important event in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previously, we demonstrated that the blockage of the kinin B2 receptor (B2R) protects against the memory deficits induced by amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide in mice. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of B2R on Abeta-induced neuroinflammation in mice and the beneficial effects of B2R blockage in synapses alterations. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The selective kinin B2R antagonist HOE 140 (50 pmol/site) was given by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) route to male Swiss mice 2 h prior the i.c.v. injection of Abeta(1-40) (400 pmol/site) peptide. Animals were sacrificed, at specific time points after Abeta(1-40) injection (6 h, 1 day or 8 days), and the brain was collected in order to perform immunohistochemical analysis. Different groups of animals were submitted to behavioral cognition tests on day 14 after Abeta(1-40) administration. KEY RESULTS: In this study, we report that the pre-treatment with the selective kinin B2R antagonist HOE 140 significantly inhibited Abeta-induced neuroinflammation in mice. B2R antagonism reduced microglial activation and the levels of pro-inflammatory proteins, including COX-2, iNOS and nNOS. Notably, these phenomena were accompanied by an inhibition of MAPKs (JNK and p38) and transcription factors (c-Jun and p65/NF-kappaB) activation. Finally, the anti-inflammatory effects of B2R antagonism provided significant protection against Abeta(1-40)-induced synaptic loss and cognitive impairment in mice. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Collectively, these results suggest that B2R activation may play a critical role in Abeta-induced neuroinflammation, one of the most important contributors to AD progression, and its blockage can provide synapses protection.

25446812|t|Reference and working memory deficits in the 3xTg-AD mouse between 2 and 15-months of age: a cross-sectional study.
25446812|a|Impairments in working memory (WM) can predict the shift from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the rate at which AD progresses with age. The 3xTg-AD mouse model develops both Abeta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, the neuro-pathological hallmarks of AD, by 6 months of age, but no research has investigated the age-related changes in WM in these mice. Using a cross-sectional design, we tested male and female 3xTg-AD and wildtype control (B6129SF2/J) mice between 2 and 15 months of age for reference and working memory errors in the 8-arm radial maze. The 3xTg-AD mice had deficits in both working and reference memory across the ages tested, rather than showing the predicted age-related memory deficits. Male 3xTg-AD mice showed more working and reference memory errors than females, but there were no sex differences in wildtype control mice. These results indicate that the 3xTg-AD mouse replicates the impairments in WM found in patients with AD. However, these mice show memory deficits as early as two months of age, suggesting that the genes underlying reference and working memory in these mice cause deficits from an early age. The finding that males were affected more than females suggests that more attention should be paid to sex differences in transgenic AD mice.

25447788|t|Fenofibrate reduces amyloidogenic processing of APP in APP/PS1 transgenic mice via PPAR-alpha/PI3-K pathway.
25447788|a|The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-alpha), a member of the family of ligand-activated nuclear hormone receptors, plays a relevant role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To better understand the role of PPAR-alpha in AD, we examined the ability of fenofibrate (a PPAR-alpha agonist) to regulate amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. After intragastric administration of fenofibrate into 3-month-old APP/PS1 transgenic mice for 6 months, and the levels of relative proteins were quantified by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, Western blotting and ELISA. We found that fenofibrate increased the expression of PPAR-alpha, and decreased beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1) mRNA and protein levels, and also reduced soluble APPbeta (sAPPbeta) and amyloid-beta 42 (Abeta42) releases. However. fenofibrate did not modify the levels of APP and presenilin 1 (PS1). Furthermore, LY294002, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) inhibitor, suppressed the effects of fenofibrate on BACE-1, sAPPbeta, and Abeta42, but not PPAR-alpha. Our data suggest that fenofibrate may reduce the amyloidogenic processing of APP in APP/PS1 transgenic mice via PPAR-alpha/PI3-K pathway.

25447943|t|Vascular pathology of 20-month-old hypercholesterolemia mice in  comparison to triple-transgenic and APPSwDI Alzheimer's disease  mouse models.
25447943|a|Several studies have shown that elevated plasma cholesterol levels (i.e. hypercholesterolemia) serve as a risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it remains unclear how hypercholesterolemia may contribute to the onset and progression of AD pathology. In order to determine the role of hypercholesterolemia at various stages of AD, we evaluated the effects of high cholesterol diet (5% cholesterol) in wild-type (WT; C57BL6) and triple-transgenic AD (3xTg-AD; Psen1, APPSwe, tauB301L) mice at 7, 14, and 20 months. The transgenic APP-Swedish/Dutch/Iowa AD mouse model (APPSwDI) was used as a control since these animals are more pathologically-accelerated and are known to exhibit extensive plaque deposition and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Here, we describe the effects of high cholesterol diet on: (1) cognitive function and stress, (2) AD-associated pathologies, (3) neuroinflammation, (4) blood-brain barrier disruption and ventricle size, and (5) vascular dysfunction. Our data show that high dietary cholesterol increases weight, slightly impairs cognitive function, promotes glial cell activation and complement-related pathways, enhances the infiltration of blood-derived proteins and alters vascular integrity, however, it does not induce AD-related pathologies. While normal-fed 3xTg-AD mice display a typical AD-like pathology in addition to severe cognitive impairment and neuroinflammation at 20 months of age, vascular alterations are less pronounced. No microbleedings were seen by MRI, however, the ventricle size was enlarged. Triple-transgenic AD mice, on the other hand, fed a high cholesterol diet do not survive past 14 months of age. Our data indicates that cholesterol does not markedly potentiate AD-related pathology, nor does it cause significant impairments in cognition. However, it appears that high cholesterol diet markedly increases stress-related plasma corticosterone levels as well as some vessel pathologies. Together, our findings represent the first demonstration of prolonged high cholesterol diet and the examination of its effects at various stages of cerebrovascular- and AD-related disease.

25448043|t|Tau, amyloid, and hypometabolism in a patient with posterior cortical atrophy.
25448043|a|Determining the relative contribution of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles to brain dysfunction in Alzheimer disease is critical for therapeutic approaches, but until recently could only be assessed at autopsy. We report a patient with posterior cortical atrophy (visual variant of Alzheimer disease) who was studied using the novel tau tracer [(18) F]AV-1451 in conjunction with [(11) C]Pittsburgh compound B (PIB; amyloid) and [(18) F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography. Whereas [(11) C]PIB bound throughout association neocortex, [(18) F]AV-1451 was selectively retained in posterior brain regions that were affected clinically and showed markedly reduced [(18) F]FDG uptake. This provides preliminary in vivo evidence that tau is more closely linked to hypometabolism and symptomatology than amyloid.

25449301|t|Determining binding sites of polycyclic aromatic small molecule-based amyloid-beta peptide aggregation modulators using sequence-specific antibodies.
25449301|a|Numerous aromatic small molecule modulators of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) monomer aggregation and neurotoxicity have been identified with the ultimate goal of Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment. Determining binding sites of these modulators on Abeta monomer is an important topic in the mechanistic understanding of AD pathology and drug development. However, Abeta monomer binding sites have been reported for only a very limited number of Abeta modulators. In this article, we present a convenient method for determining aggregation-modulating polycyclic aromatic small molecule ligand binding sites on Abeta monomer using immunostaining with a panel of Abeta sequence-specific antibodies. To validate our technique, we first examined one modulating aromatic ligand, Congo Red, with known binding sites, which yielded consistent results with previous findings. Then, using the same technique, binding sites on Abeta of four known Abeta monomer aggregation modulators, Erythrosin B, Eosin Y, Phloxine B, and Rose Bengal, were determined. The identified ligand binding sites were also confirmed by a separate fluorescence quenching-based assay using a panel of overlapping Abeta sub-fragments. The technique described here greatly increases researchers' ability to determine the Abeta monomer binding site(s) of aggregation-modulating aromatic small molecule ligands and to screen for new ligands that bind specific regions on Abeta.

25449529|t|Imaging neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease and other dementias: Recent advances and future directions.
25449529|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and Huntington's disease (HD) are the main neurodegenerative causes of dementia. Causes and mechanisms of these diseases remain elusive. Neuroinflammation is increasingly emerging as an important pathological factor in their development. Positron emission tomography (PET) using [11C]PK11195 represents a method of visualizing the microglial component of neuroinflammation via the translocator protein (TSPO) and we discuss the valuable insights this has yielded in neurodegenerative diseases. We discuss the limitations of this method and the development of second generation TSPO PET ligands which hope to overcome these limitations. We also discuss other methods of visualizing neuroinflammation and review the state of current dementia treatments targeted at neuroinflammation. It is our view that a multimodal investigation into neuroinflammation in AD, Parkinson's disease dementia, FTD and HD will yield valuable pathological insights which will usefully inform development of therapeutic targets and biomarkers.

25450149|t|SORL1 gene polymorphism association with late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
25450149|a|We examined the relationship between loci polymorphisms (rs689021, rs3824966, and rs1784933) of the sortilin-related receptor 1 gene (SORL1) and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) in the Chinese Han population of the Hunan Changsha region. A case-control association analysis was used. Clinical data and peripheral blood were collected from 201 Alzheimer's disease patients and 257 healthy controls. PCR and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry detection technologies were used to identify single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) distribution at SORL1 gene loci. Genotype and allele frequency differences were analyzed and compared between groups. No significant differences were found in genotype frequency distributions of the rs689021 and rs3824966 loci. Similarly, allele frequency distributions of the C and T alleles of rs689021, and the C and G alleles of rs3824966 showed no significant differences. However, the genotype frequency distribution of the rs1784933 locus was significantly different, and the allele frequency distribution of the A and G alleles were also significantly different. Multifactor logistic regression analysis showed that after correcting for confounding factors such as gender, age, and cholesterol, LOAD risk in rs1784933 AA genotype carriers was 1.803 times that in AG+GG genotype carriers. SORL1 gene SNPs at rs689021 and rs3824966 loci show no relationship with LOAD onset in the Chinese Han population of the Hunan Changsha region. Conversely, a SORL1 gene SNP at the rs1784933 locus is associated with LOAD onset, with the A allele being a risk factor.

25450392|t|Hemin as a generic and potent protein misfolding inhibitor.
25450392|a|Protein misfolding causes serious biological malfunction, resulting in diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and cataract. Molecules which inhibit protein misfolding are a promising avenue to explore as therapeutics for the treatment of these diseases. In the present study, thioflavin T fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy experiments demonstrated that hemin prevents amyloid fibril formation of kappa-casein, amyloid beta peptide and alpha-synuclein by blocking beta-sheet structure assembly which is essential in fibril aggregation. Further, inhibition of fibril formation by hemin significantly reduces the cytotoxicity caused by fibrillar amyloid beta peptide in vitro. Interestingly, hemin degrades partially formed amyloid fibrils and prevents further aggregation to mature fibrils. Light scattering assay results revealed that hemin also prevents protein amorphous aggregation of alcohol dehydrogenase, catalase and gammas-crystallin. In summary, hemin is a potent agent which generically stabilises proteins against aggregation, and has potential as a key molecule for the development of therapeutics for protein misfolding diseases.

25450465|t|WASP-1, a canonical Wnt signaling potentiator, rescues hippocampal synaptic impairments induced by Abeta oligomers.
25450465|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers are a key factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated synaptic dysfunction. Abeta oligomers block the induction of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in rodents. The activation of Wnt signaling prevents Abeta oligomer-induced neurotoxic effects. The compound WASP-1 (Wnt-activating small molecule potentiator-1), has been described as a synergist of the ligand Wnt-3a, enhancing the activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Herein, we report that WASP-1 administration successfully rescued Abeta-induced synaptic impairments both in vitro and in vivo. The activation of canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling by WASP-1 increased synaptic transmission and rescued hippocampal LTP impairments induced by Abeta oligomers. Additionally, intra-hippocampal administration of WASP-1 to the double transgenic APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse model of AD prevented synaptic protein loss and reduced tau phosphorylation levels. Moreover, we found that WASP-1 blocked Abeta aggregation in vitro and reduced pathological tau phosphorylation in vivo. These results indicate that targeting canonical Wnt signaling with WASP-1 could have value for treating AD.

25450902|t|Combination of Pitavastatin and melatonin shows partial antineoplastic effects in a rat breast carcinoma model.
25450902|a|Our previous results indicated significant tumor-suppressive effects of different statins in rat mammary carcinogenesis. The purpose of this experiment was to examine the chemopreventive effects of Pitavastatin alone and in combination with the pineal hormone melatonin in the model of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea-induced mammary carcinogenesis in female Sprague-Dawley rats. Pitavastatin was administered dietary (10mg/kg) and melatonin in an aqueous solution (20mug/ml). Chemoprevention began 7 days prior to carcinogen administration and subsequently continued for 15 weeks until autopsy. At autopsy, mammary tumors were removed and prepared for histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis. Compared to controls, Pitavastatin alone reduced average tumor volume by 58% and lengthened latency by 8 days; on the other hand, the drug increased tumor frequency by 23%. Combined administration of Pitavastatin with melatonin decreased tumor frequency by 23%, tumor volume by 44% and lengthened tumor latency by 5.5 days compared to control animals. The analysis of carcinoma cells showed significant increase in caspase-3 expression in both treated groups and a tendency of increased caspase-7 expression after Pitavastatin treatment alone. Significant expression decrease of Ki67 was found in carcinoma cells from both treated groups. Compared to control carcinoma cells, Pitavastatin alone increased VEGF expression by 41%, however melatonin totally reversed its undesirable effect. Pitavastatin combined with melatonin significantly increased femur compact bone thickness in animals. Pitavastatin alone decreased plasma triglycerides and total cholesterol levels, however it significantly increased levels of glucose. In summary, our results show a partial antineoplastic effect of Pitavastatin combined with melatonin in the rat mammary gland carcinoma model.

25450955|t|CHF5074 (CSP-1103) induces microglia alternative activation in plaque-free Tg2576 mice and primary glial cultures exposed to beta-amyloid.
25450955|a|Activation of microglia associated with neuroinflammation and loss of phagocytic activity is considered to play a prominent role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). CHF5074 (CSP-1103) has been shown to improve cognition and reduce brain inflammation in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). CHF5074 was also found to reverse impairments in recognition memory and improve hippocampal long-term potentiation when administered to plaque-free Tg2576 mice (5-month-old) for 4 weeks. Though, no investigation has focused on the consequence of CHF5074 treatment on microglia polarization yet. In this study we evaluated the effect of CHF5074 administration (375 ppm in the diet) to 5-month-old Tg2576 mice on the expression of pro-inflammatory (M1) genes, Interleukin 1 beta (IL-1beta), Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFalpha) and inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS), and anti-inflammatory/phagocytic (M2) markers Mannose Receptor type C 1 (MRC1/CD206), Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) and Chitinase 3-like 3 (Ym1). No changes of pro-inflammatory gene transcription but a reduced expression of MRC1/CD206, TREM2 and Ym1 were detected in the hippocampus of young Tg2576 mice receiving normal diet, when compared to wild-type littermates. CHF5074 did not affect the pro-inflammatory transcription but significantly increased the expression of MRC1/CD206 and Ym1. CHF5074 effects appeared to be hippocampus-specific, as the M2 transcripts were only slightly modified in the cerebral cortex. In primary cultures of mouse astrocyte-microglia, CHF5074 totally suppressed the expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and iNOS induced by 10 muM beta-amyloid1-42 (Abeta42). Moreover, CHF5074 significantly increased the expression of anti-inflammatory/phagocytic markers MRC1/CD206 and TREM2, reduced by the Abeta42 application alone. The effect of CHF5074 was not reproduced by ibuprofen (3 muM or 500 muM) or R-flurbiprofen (3 muM or 100 muM), as both compounds limited the pro-inflammatory gene expression but did not modify the anti-inflammatory/phagocytic transcription. These data show that CHF5074 specifically drives the expression of microglia M2 markers either in young Tg2576 hippocampus or in primary astrocyte-microglia cultures, suggesting its potential therapeutic efficacy as microglial modulator in the early phase of AD.

25453085|t|Crucial role of nonspecific interactions in amyloid nucleation.
25453085|a|Protein oligomers have been implicated as toxic agents in a wide range of amyloid-related diseases. However, it has remained unsolved whether the oligomers are a necessary step in the formation of amyloid fibrils or just a dangerous byproduct. Analogously, it has not been resolved if the amyloid nucleation process is a classical one-step nucleation process or a two-step process involving prenucleation clusters. We use coarse-grained computer simulations to study the effect of nonspecific attractions between peptides on the primary nucleation process underlying amyloid fibrillization. We find that, for peptides that do not attract, the classical one-step nucleation mechanism is possible but only at nonphysiologically high peptide concentrations. At low peptide concentrations, which mimic the physiologically relevant regime, attractive interpeptide interactions are essential for fibril formation. Nucleation then inevitably takes place through a two-step mechanism involving prefibrillar oligomers. We show that oligomers not only help peptides meet each other but also, create an environment that facilitates the conversion of monomers into the beta-sheet-rich form characteristic of fibrils. Nucleation typically does not proceed through the most prevalent oligomers but through an oligomer size that is only observed in rare fluctuations, which is why such aggregates might be hard to capture experimentally. Finally, we find that the nucleation of amyloid fibrils cannot be described by classical nucleation theory: in the two-step mechanism, the critical nucleus size increases with increases in both concentration and interpeptide interactions, which is in direct contrast with predictions from classical nucleation theory. 

25453559|t|Abeta42 oligomers selectively disrupt neuronal calcium release.
25453559|a|Accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides correlates with aging and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta peptides, which cause early synaptic dysfunctions, spine loss, and memory deficits, also disturb intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis. By cytosolic and endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) measurements, we here define the short-term effects of synthetic Abeta42 on neuronal Ca(2+) dynamics. When applied acutely at submicromolar concentration, as either oligomers or monomers, Abeta42 did not cause Ca(2+) release or Ca(2+) influx. Similarly, 1-hour treatment with Abeta42 modified neither the resting cytosolic Ca(2+) level nor the long-lasting Ca(2+) influx caused by KCl-induced depolarization. In contrast, Abeta42 oligomers, but not monomers, significantly altered Ca(2+) release from stores with opposite effects on inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)- and caffeine-induced Ca(2+) mobilization without alteration of the total store Ca(2+) content. Ca(2+) dysregulation by Abeta42 oligomers involves metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 and requires network activity and the intact exo-endocytotic machinery, being prevented by tetrodotoxin and tetanus toxin. These findings support the idea that Ca(2+) store dysfunction is directly involved in Abeta42 neurotoxicity and represents a potential therapeutic target in AD-like dementia.

25456500|t|Dendritic structural degeneration is functionally linked to cellular hyperexcitability in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
25456500|a|Dendritic structure critically determines the electrical properties of neurons and, thereby, defines the fundamental process of input-to-output conversion. The diversity of dendritic architectures enables neurons to fulfill their specialized circuit functions during cognitive processes. It is known that this dendritic integrity is impaired in patients with Alzheimer's disease and in relevant mouse models. It is unknown, however, whether this structural degeneration translates into aberrant neuronal function. Here we use in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, high-resolution STED imaging, and computational modeling of CA1 pyramidal neurons in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease to show that structural degeneration and neuronal hyperexcitability are crucially linked. Our results demonstrate that a structure-dependent amplification of synaptic input to action potential output conversion might constitute a novel cellular pathomechanism underlying network dysfunction with potential relevance for other neurodegenerative diseases with abnormal changes of dendritic morphology.

25456519|t|Iron increases APP translation and amyloid-beta production in the retina.
25456519|a|Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of blindness among older adults in developed countries, and retinal iron accumulation may exacerbate the disease. Iron can upregulate the production of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Since amyloid-beta (Abeta), a byproduct of APP proteolysis, is found in drusen, the histopathological hallmark of AMD, we tested the role of iron in regulating APP and Abeta levels in the retinal pigment epithelial cell line ARPE-19. We found that treatment with ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) increases APP at the translational level. FAC treatment also results in increased generation of APP C-terminal fragments C83 and C99, the products of APP proteolysis by alpha- and beta-secretase, respectively, as well as levels of Abeta42, a highly aggregative amyloid species. Additionally, retinal tissue sections from a patient with aceruloplasminemia, a disease causing iron overload in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), showed increased Abeta deposition in the RPE and drusen. Overall, our results suggest that RPE iron overload could contribute to Abeta accumulation in the retina.

25456845|t|Possible protective role of the 489C>T P2X7R polymorphism in Alzheimer's disease.
25456845|a|Inflammation is a key factor in the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) is increasingly recognized as key pro-inflammatory receptor. A recent study has shown that activation of microglia by amyloid beta (Abeta) and associated release of IL-1beta, requires P2X7R expression. In this study we assessed by RT-PCR in genomic DNA samples, the frequency of two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of P2X7R in AD patients compared to age-matched non demented elderly. Our data show that the 489C>T SNP was significantly less frequent in AD patients than in controls (p=0.01), whereas there was no statistical difference in 1513A>C frequency in either groups. In addition, presence of the 1513C allele and absence of the 489C allele decreased the probability of having AD by about four fold. In conclusion, our data show a strong negative association between the P2X7R 489C>T polymorphism and AD, especially in the presence of the 1513C allele.

25457431|t|The influence of biological and technical factors on quantitative analysis of amyloid PET: Points to consider and recommendations for controlling variability in longitudinal data.
25457431|a|In vivo imaging of amyloid burden with positron emission tomography (PET) provides a means for studying the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's and related diseases. Measurement of subtle changes in amyloid burden requires quantitative analysis of image data. Reliable quantitative analysis of amyloid PET scans acquired at multiple sites and over time requires rigorous standardization of acquisition protocols, subject management, tracer administration, image quality control, and image processing and analysis methods. We review critical points in the acquisition and analysis of amyloid PET, identify ways in which technical factors can contribute to measurement variability, and suggest methods for mitigating these sources of noise. Improved quantitative accuracy could reduce the sample size necessary to detect intervention effects when amyloid PET is used as a treatment end point and allow more reliable interpretation of change in amyloid burden and its relationship to clinical course.

25457550|t|N-terminal region of myelin basic protein reduces fibrillar amyloid-beta deposition in Tg-5xFAD mice.
25457550|a|Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by extensive deposition of fibrillar amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the brain. Previously, myelin basic protein (MBP) was identified to be a potent inhibitor to Abeta fibril formation, and this inhibitory activity was localized to the N-terminal residues 1-64, a fragment designated MBP1. Here, we show that the modest neuronal expression of a fusion protein of the biologically active MBP1 fragment and the enhanced green fluorescent protein (MBP1-EGFP) significantly improved the performance of spatial learning memory in Tg-5xFAD mice, a model of pathologic Abeta accumulation in brain. The levels of insoluble Abeta and fibrillar amyloid were significantly reduced in bigenic Tg-5xFAD/Tg-MBP1-EGFP mice. Quantitative stereological analysis revealed that the reduction in amyloid was because of a reduction in the size of fibrillar plaques rather than a decrease in plaque numbers. The current findings support previous studies showing that MBP1 inhibits Abeta fibril formation in vitro and demonstrate the ability of MBP1 to reduce Abeta pathology and improve behavioral performance.

25457554|t|Systemic administration of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) reduces BACE1 expression and amyloid pathology in APP23 mice.
25457554|a|There is an emerging evidence that growth factors may have a potential beneficial use in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) because of their neuroprotective properties and effects on neuronal proliferation. Basic fibroblast growth factor or fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) is an anti-inflammatory, angiogenic, and neurotrophic factor that is expressed in many cell types, including neurons and glial cells. Here, we explored whether subcutaneous administration of FGF2 could have therapeutic effects in the APP 23 transgenic mouse, a model of amyloid pathology. FGF2 treatment attenuated spatial memory deficits, reduced amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau pathologies, decreased inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, and increased the number of astrocytes in the dentate gyrus in APP 23 mice compared with the vehicle-treated controls. The decrease in Abeta deposition was associated with a reduction in the expression of BACE1, the main enzyme responsible for Abeta generation. These results were confirmed in a neuroblastoma cell line, which demonstrated that incubation with FGF2 regulates BACE1 transcription. In addition, and in contrast with what has been previously published, the levels of FGF2 were reduced in postmortem brains from AD patients compared with controls. These data, therefore, suggest that systemic administration of FGF2 could have a potential therapeutic application in AD.

25457982|t|Photo-induced inhibition of Alzheimer's beta-amyloid aggregation in vitro by rose bengal.
25457982|a|The abnormal aggregation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides in the brain is a major pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The suppression (or alteration) of Abeta aggregation is considered to be an attractive therapeutic intervention for treating AD. We report on visible light-induced inhibition of Abeta aggregation by xanthene dyes, which are widely used as biomolecule tracers and imaging markers for live cells. Among many xanthene dyes, rose bengal (RB) under green LED illumination exhibited a much stronger inhibition effect upon photo-excitation on Abeta aggregation than RB under dark conditions. We found that RB possesses high binding affinity to Abeta; it exhibits a remarkable red shift and a strong enhancement of fluorescence emission in the presence of Abeta. Photo-excited RB interfered with an early step in the pathway of Abeta self-assembly and suppressed the conformational transition of Abeta monomers into beta-sheet-rich structures. Photo-excited RB is not only effective in the inhibition of Abeta aggregation, but also in the reduction of Abeta-induced cytotoxicity.

25459675|t|The detection of beta-amyloid plaques in an Alzheimer's disease rat model with DDNP-SPIO.
25459675|a|AIM: To detect the beta-amyloid plaques (Abeta) in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles coated with 1,1-dicyano-2-[6-(dimethylamino)-naphthalene-2-yl] propene carboxyl derivative (DDNP-SPIO). MATERIALS AND METHODS: DDNP-SPIO was prepared in a previous trial. The binding affinity of DDNP-SPIO to Abeta was tested using fluorescence spectrophotometry in vitro. In vivo, five AD rats and five non-AD rats were intravenously injected with DDNP-SPIO at a dose of 76 mumol Fe/kg. Coronal T2*-weighted images were collected at baseline and repeated at 10, 30, and 60 min post-injection. Enhancement features of the two groups were analysed. After imaging, brain specimens were resected for Congo red and Prussian blue staining to assess the binding of DDNP-SPIO to Abeta deposits. RESULTS: In vitro experiments indicated that the DDNP-SPIO nanoparticles displayed high binding affinities towards Abeta with a Kd value of 29.4 nmol/l. A significant decrease in SI was detected in the hippocampal area of AD rats after intravenous injection of the nanoparticles, but not in non-AD rats. The measurement of the percentage signal loss decreased to 52% in AD rats. In non-AD rats, only 10% signal loss was observed. There was a significant difference between the two groups (t = 4.533, p < 0.05). The signal decrease resulted from the binding of the DDNP-SPIO nanoparticles to the Abeta plaques, which was identified with Congo red and Prussian blue staining. CONCLUSION: The DDNP-SPIO nanoparticles could potentially be used for visualizing Abeta plaques, which may be helpful for diagnosing the early stages of AD and monitoring the effects of drug therapy.

25459942|t|Metabolomic screening of regional brain alterations in the APP/PS1 transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease by direct infusion mass spectrometry.
25459942|a|The identification of pathological mechanisms underlying to Alzheimer's disease is of great importance for the discovery of potential markers for diagnosis and disease monitoring. In this study, we investigated regional metabolic alterations in brain from the APP/PS1 mice, a transgenic model that reproduces well some of the neuropathological and cognitive deficits observed in human Alzheimer's disease. For this purpose, hippocampus, cortex, cerebellum and olfactory bulbs were analyzed using a high-throughput metabolomic approach based on direct infusion mass spectrometry. Metabolic fingerprints showed significant differences between transgenic and wild-type mice in all brain tissues, being hippocampus and cortex the most affected regions. Alterations in numerous metabolites were detected including phospholipids, fatty acids, purine and pyrimidine metabolites, acylcarnitines, sterols and amino acids, among others. Furthermore, metabolic pathway analysis revealed important alterations in homeostasis of lipids, energy management, and metabolism of amino acids and nucleotides. Therefore, these findings demonstrate the potential of metabolomic screening and the use of transgenic models for understanding pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

25462251|t|Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of 2-arylethenylquinoline derivatives as multifunctional agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
25462251|a|A series of new 2-arylethenylquinoline derivatives (4a1-4a12, 4b1-4b8, 4c1-4c4, 4d1-4d3 and 4e1-4e9) were designed, synthesized, and evaluated as potential multifunctional agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In vitro studies showed that these synthetic compounds inhibited self-induced Abeta1-42 aggregation effectively ranged from 23.6% to 83.9% at the concentration of 20 muM, and acted as potential antioxidants and biometal chelators. Their structure-activity relationships were obtained and discussed. In particular, compound 4b1, the most active compound, displayed strong inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 9.7 muM for self-induced Abeta1-42 aggregation, good antioxidative activity with a value of 3.9-fold of Trolox, potent inhibitory activity for cholinesterase with IC50 values of 0.2 muM and 64.1 muM against butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), respectively. Besides, 4b1 was also capable of disassembling the self-induced Abeta1-42 aggregation fibrils with a ratio of 59.8% at 20 muM concentration, and had a good metal chelating activity. Taken together, these results suggest that compound 4b1 might be a promising lead compound for AD treatment.

25464000|t|Surgical Apgar Score predicts an increased risk of major complications and death after renal mass excision.
25464000|a|PURPOSE: Tailoring perioperative management to minimize the postoperative complication rates depends on reliable prognostication of patients most at risk. The Surgical Apgar Score is an objective measure of the operative course validated to predict major complications and death after general/vascular surgery. We assessed the ability of the Surgical Apgar Score to identify patients most at risk for postoperative morbidity and mortality after renal mass excision. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data for 886 patients undergoing renal mass excision via radical or partial nephrectomy from 2010 to 2013 were extracted from a prospectively collected database. The Surgical Apgar Score was calculated using electronic anesthesia records. Major postoperative complications, readmission and reoperation within 30 days of surgery as well as 90-day mortality were examined. RESULTS: Overall 13.2% of patients experienced major postoperative complications at 30 days. Clavien grade I, II, III, IV and V complications were experienced by 1.7%, 2.9%, 5.8%, 1.9% and 0.9%, respectively. The 90-day all cause mortality rate was 1.4%. The Surgical Apgar Score was significantly lower in patients experiencing major complications (mean 7.3 vs 7.8, p=0.004) and death (6.3 vs 7.7, p=0.03). Patients with a Surgical Apgar Score of 4 or less were 3.7 times more likely to experience a major complication (p=0.01) and 24 times more likely to die within 90 days of surgery (p=0.0007) compared to patients with a Surgical Apgar Score greater than 8. CONCLUSIONS: The Surgical Apgar Score is an easily collected metric that can identify patients at higher risk for major complications and death after renal mass excision. A prospective trial to help further delineate the optimal use of this tool in an adjusted perioperative management approach with patients undergoing renal mass excision is warranted.

25467149|t|Structure activity relationship study of curcumin analogues toward the amyloid-beta aggregation inhibitor.
25467149|a|Inhibition of the amyloid beta aggregation process could possibly prevent the onset of Alzheimer's disease. In this article, we report a structure-activity relationship study of curcumin analogues for anti amyloid beta aggregation activity. Compound 7, the ideal amyloid beta aggregation inhibitor in vitro among synthesized curcumin analogues, has not only potent anti amyloid beta aggregation effects, but also water solubility more than 160 times that of curcumin. In addition, new approaches to improve water solubility of curcumin-type compounds are proposed.

25467848|t|Safety, tolerability, and efficacy of PBT2 in Huntington's disease: a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
25467848|a|BACKGROUND: PBT2 is a metal protein-attenuating compound that might reduce metal-induced aggregation of mutant huntingtin and has prolonged survival in a mouse model of Huntington's disease. We aimed to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of PBT2 in patients with Huntington's disease. METHODS: In this 26-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, adults (>=25 years old) with early-stage to mid-stage Huntington's disease were randomly assigned (1:1:1) by a centralised interactive response system to once daily PBT2 250 mg, PBT2 100 mg, or placebo. Randomisation was stratified by site with a block size of three. Participants, carers, the steering committee, site investigators, study staff, and the study sponsor were masked to treatment assignment. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability. The safety population consisted of all participants who were randomly assigned and had at least one dose of study drug. The principal secondary endpoint was cognition, measured by the change from baseline to week 26 in the main composite Z score of five cognitive tests (Category Fluency Test, Trail Making Test Part B, Map Search, Symbol Digit Modalities Test, and Stroop Word Reading Test) and scores on eight individual cognitive tests (the five aforementioned plus the Trail Making Test Part A, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and the Speeded Tapping Test). The intention-to-treat population comprised participants who were randomly assigned and had at least one efficacy assessment after administration of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01590888. FINDINGS: Between April 18, 2012, and Dec 14, 2012, 109 participants were randomly assigned to PBT2 250 mg (n=36), PBT2 100 mg (n=38), or placebo (n=35) at 19 research centres in Australia and the USA. 32 (89%) individuals on PBT2 250 mg, 38 (100%) on PBT2 100 mg, and 34 (97%) on placebo completed the study. Six serious adverse events (acute coronary syndrome, major depression, pneumonia, suicide attempt, viral infection, and worsening of Huntington's disease) occurred in five participants in the PBT2 250 mg group, three (fall with subdural haematoma, suicide attempt, and hospital admission for stabilisation of Huntington's disease) occurred in two participants in the PBT2 100 mg group, and one (increasing aggression) occurred in a participant in the placebo group. The site investigators deemed all, except the worsening of Huntington's disease, as unrelated to study drug. 32 (89%) participants on PBT2 250 mg, 30 (79%) on PBT2 100 mg, and 28 (80%) on placebo had at least one adverse event. Compared with placebo, neither PBT2 100 mg (least-squares mean 0 02, 95% CI -0 10 to 0 14; p=0 772) nor PBT2 250 mg (0 07, -0 05 to 0 20; p=0 240) significantly improved the main composite cognition Z score between baseline and 26 weeks. Compared with placebo, the Trail Making Test Part B score was improved between baseline and 26 weeks in the PBT2 250 mg group (17 65 s, 0 65-34 65; p=0 042) but not in the 100 mg group (0 79 s improvement, -15 75 to 17 32; p=0 925); neither dose significantly improved cognition on the other tests. INTERPRETATION: PBT2 was generally safe and well tolerated in patients with Huntington's disease. The potential benefit on executive function will need to be confirmed in a larger study.

25468335|t|Fiber-dependent and -independent toxicity of islet amyloid polypeptide.
25468335|a|The 37-residue peptide hormone islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) plays a central role in diabetes pathology. Although its amyloid fiber aggregation kinetics and cytotoxicity to beta-cells are well documented, few reports have directly assessed the role of fibers in cell-based toxicity experiments. Here, we report that amyloid formation of IAPP can be strongly inhibited by the extracellular environment of live cells. For example, fiber formation is more strongly suppressed in cell culture medium than in aqueous buffer. The serum component of the medium is responsible for this inhibition. Although amyloid formation was previously shown to be catalyzed by both synthetic and chloroform-extracted phospholipid surfaces, it is instead inhibited by membrane surfaces prepared directly from the plasma membranes of an immortal beta-cell line. This disparity is reconciled by direct assessment of fibers in cell-culture-based toxicity experiments. We discovered that fibers are nontoxic if they are washed free of adsorbed nonfibrillar components. Moreover, toxicity is not only rescued when monomers are added back to fibers but is greater than what is observed from the precursor alone. Our results are interpreted in light of the capacity of the fiber surface to template amyloid nucleation.

25469942|t|Stable, metastable, and kinetically trapped amyloid aggregate phases.
25469942|a|Self-assembly of proteins into amyloid fibrils plays a key role in a multitude of human disorders that range from Alzheimer's disease to type II diabetes. Compact oligomeric species, observed early during amyloid formation, are reported as the molecular entities responsible for the toxic effects of amyloid self-assembly. However, the relation between early-stage oligomeric aggregates and late-stage rigid fibrils, which are the hallmark structure of amyloid plaques, has remained unclear. We show that these different structures occupy well-defined regions in a peculiar phase diagram. Lysozyme amyloid oligomers and their curvilinear fibrils only form after they cross a salt and protein concentration-dependent threshold. We also determine a boundary for the onset of amyloid oligomer precipitation. The oligomeric aggregates are structurally distinct from rigid fibrils and are metastable against nucleation and growth of rigid fibrils. These experimentally determined boundaries match well with colloidal model predictions that account for salt-modulated charge repulsion. The model also incorporates the metastable and kinetic character of oligomer phases. Similarities and differences of amyloid oligomer assembly to metastable liquid-liquid phase separation of proteins and to surfactant aggregation are discussed.

25471562|t|Social interaction rescues memory deficit in an animal model of Alzheimer's disease by increasing BDNF-dependent hippocampal neurogenesis.
25471562|a|It has been recognized that the risk of cognitive decline during aging can be reduced if one maintains strong social connections, yet the neural events underlying this beneficial effect have not been rigorously studied. Here, we show that amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS1) double-transgenic (APP/PS1) mice demonstrate improvement in memory after they are cohoused with wild-type mice. The improvement was associated with increased protein and mRNA levels of BDNF in the hippocampus. Concomitantly, the number of BrdU(+)/NeuN(+) cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus was significantly elevated after cohousing. Methylazoxymethanol acetate, a cell proliferation blocker, markedly reduced BrdU(+) and BrdU/NeuN(+) cells and abolished the effect of social interaction. Selective ablation of mitotic neurons using diphtheria toxin (DT) and a retrovirus vector encoding DT receptor abolished the beneficial effect of cohousing. Knockdown of BDNF by shRNA transfection blocked, whereas overexpression of BDNF mimicked the memory-improving effect. A tropomyosin-related kinase B agonist, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone, occluded the effect of social interaction. These results demonstrate that increased BDNF expression and neurogenesis in the hippocampus after cohousing underlie the reversal of memory deficit in APP/PS1 mice.

25471565|t|Early Alzheimer's disease neuropathology detected by proton MR spectroscopy.
25471565|a|Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) is sensitive to early neurodegenerative processes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although (1)H-MRS metabolite ratios of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr), NAA/myoinositol (mI), and mI/Cr measured in the posterior cingulate gyrus reveal evidence of disease progression in AD, pathologic underpinnings of the (1)H-MRS metabolite changes in AD are unknown. Pathologically diagnosed human cases ranging from no likelihood to high likelihood AD (n = 41, 16 females and 25 males) who underwent antemortem (1)H-MRS of the posterior cingulate gyrus at 3 tesla were included in this study. Immunohistochemical evaluation was performed on the posterior cingulate gyrus using antibodies to synaptic vesicles, hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau), neurofibrillary tangle conformational-epitope (cNFT), amyloid-beta, astrocytes, and microglia. The slides were digitally analyzed using Aperio software, which allows neuropathologic quantification in the posterior cingulate gray matter. MRS and pathology associations were adjusted for time from scan to death. Significant associations across AD and control subjects were found between reduced synaptic immunoreactivity and both NAA/Cr and NAA/mI in the posterior cingulate gyrus. Higher pTau burden was associated with lower NAA/Cr and NAA/mI. Higher amyloid-beta burden was associated with elevated mI/Cr and lower NAA/mI ratios, but not with NAA/Cr. (1)H-MRS metabolite levels reveal early neurodegenerative changes associated with AD pathology. Our findings support the hypothesis that a decrease in NAA/Cr is associated with loss of synapses and early pTau pathology, but not with amyloid-beta or later accumulation of cNFT pathology in the posterior cingulate gyrus. In addition, elevation of mI/Cr is associated with the occurrence of amyloid-beta plaques in AD.

25472656|t|Riluzole prevents soluble Abeta1-42 oligomers-induced perturbation of spontaneous discharge in the hippocampal CA1 region of rats.
25472656|a|Abnormal accumulation of soluble amyloid beta (Abeta) is believed to cause malfunction of neurons in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The hippocampus is one of the earliest affected brain regions in AD. However, little effort has been made to investigate the effects of soluble Abeta1-42 oligomers on discharge properties of hippocampal neurons in vivo. This study was designed to examine the effects of soluble Abeta1-42 oligomers on the discharge properties of hippocampal CA1 neurons using extracellular single-unit recordings in vivo. The protective effects of riluzole (RLZ) were also investigated for the prevention of soluble oligomers of Abeta1-42-induced alterations in the spontaneous discharge of hippocampal neurons. The results showed that (1) the mean frequency of spontaneous discharge was increased by the local application of 100 muM Abeta1-42 oligomers; (2) Abeta1-42 oligomers also induced alterations of the neuronal firing patterns in the hippocampal CA1 region; and (3) pretreatment with 20 muM RLZ effectively inhibited the Abeta1-42-induced enhancement of spontaneous discharge and alterations of neuronal firing patterns in CA1 neurons. Our study suggested that Abeta1-42 oligomers induced hyperactivity and perturbed the firing patterns in hippocampal neurons. RLZ may provide neuroprotective effects on the Abeta1-42-induced perturbation of neuronal activities in the hippocampal region of rats.

25475538|t|Fibrin deposited in the Alzheimer's disease brain promotes neuronal degeneration.
25475538|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and has no effective treatment. Besides the well-known pathologic characteristics, this disease also has a vascular component, and substantial evidence shows increased thrombosis as well as a critical role for fibrin(ogen) in AD. This molecule has been implicated in neuroinflammation, neurovascular damage, blood-brain barrier permeability, vascular amyloid deposition, and memory deficits that are observed in AD. Here, we present evidence demonstrating that fibrin deposition increases in the AD brain and correlates with the degree of pathology. Moreover, we show that fibrin(ogen) is present in areas of dystrophic neurites and that a modest decrease in fibrinogen levels improves neuronal health and ameliorates amyloid pathology in the subiculum of AD mice. Our results further characterize the important role of fibrin(ogen) in this disease and support the design of therapeutic strategies aimed at blocking the interaction between fibrinogen and amyloid-beta (Abeta) and/or normalizing the increased thrombosis present in AD.

25476539|t|In vivo SPECT imaging of amyloid-beta deposition with radioiodinated imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine derivative DRM106 in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
25476539|a|UNLABELLED: Noninvasive determination of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) deposition has important significance for early diagnosis and medical intervention for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, we investigated the availability of radiolabeled DRM106 ((123/125)I-DRM106 [6-iodo-2-[4-(1H-3-pyrazolyl)phenyl]imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine]), a compound with sufficient affinity for the synthesis of human Abeta fibrils and satisfactory metabolic stability, as a SPECT ligand in living brains. METHOD: The sensitivity of (125)I-DRM106 for detecting Abeta deposition was compared with that of (125)I-IMPY (2-(4'-dimethylaminophenyl)-6-iodo-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine), a well-known amyloid SPECT ligand, by ex vivo autoradiographic analyses in 18-mo-old amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice. To verify the sensitivity and quantitation of radiolabeled DRM106 for in vivo imaging, we compared the detectability of Abeta plaques with (123)I-DRM106 and a well-known amyloid PET agent, (11)C-labeled Pittsburgh compound B ((11)C-PiB), in 29-mo-old transgenic mice and age-matched nontransgenic littermates. Additionally, we compared the binding characteristics of (125)I-DRM106 with those of (11)C-PiB and (11)C-PBB3, which selectively bind to Abeta plaques and preferentially to tau aggregates, respectively, in postmortem AD brain sections. RESULTS: Ex vivo autoradiographic analysis showed that measurement with (125)I-DRM106 has a higher sensitivity for detecting Abeta accumulation than with (125)I-IMPY in transgenic mice. SPECT imaging with (123)I-DRM106 also successfully detected Abeta deposition in living aged transgenic mice and showed strong correlation (R = 0.95, P < 0.01) in quantitative analysis for Abeta plaque detection by PET imaging with (11)C-PiB, implying that sensitivity and quantitation of SPECT imaging with (123)I-DRM106 are almost as good as (11)C-PiB PET for the detectability of Abeta deposition. Further, the addition of nonradiolabeled DRM106 fully blocked the binding of (125)I-DRM106 and (11)C-PiB, but not (11)C-PBB3, to AD brain sections, and (125)I-DRM106 showed a lower binding ratio of the diffuse plaque-rich lateral temporal cortex to the dense-cored/neuritic plaque-rich hippocampal CA1 area, compared with (11)C-PiB. CONCLUSION: All of these data demonstrated the high potential of (123)I-DRM106 for amyloid imaging in preclinical and clinical application, and it might more preferentially detect dense-cored/neuritic amyloid deposition, which is expected to be closely associated with neuropathologic changes of AD.

25482438|t|ApoE-isoform-dependent cellular uptake of amyloid-beta is mediated by lipoprotein receptor LR11/SorLA.
25482438|a|The formation of senile plaques composed of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in the brain is likely the initial event in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Possession of the APOE epsilon4 allele, the strong genetic factor for AD, facilitates the Abeta deposition from the presymptomatic stage of AD in a gene-dosage-dependent manner. However, the precise mechanism by which apoE isoforms differentially induce the AD pathology is largely unknown. LR11/SorLA is a type I membrane protein that functions as the neuronal lipoprotein endocytic receptor of apoE and the sorting receptor of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to regulate amyloidogenesis. Recently, LR11/SorLA has been reported to be involved in the lysosomal targeting of extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) through the binding of Abeta to the vacuolar protein sorting 10 (VPS10) protein domain of LR11/SorLA. Here, we attempted to examine the human-apoE-isoform-dependent effect on the cellular uptake of Abeta through the formation of a complex between an apoE isoform and LR11/SorLA. Cell culture experiments using Neuro2a cells revealed that the cellular uptake of secreted apoE3 and apoE4 was enhanced by the overexpression of LR11/SorLA. In contrast, the cellular uptake of apoE2 was not affected by the expression of LR11/SorLA. Co-immunoprecipitation assay revealed that apoE-isoform-dependent differences were observed in the formation of an apoE-LR11 complex (apoE4>apoE3>apoE2). ApoE-isoform-dependent differences in cellular uptake of FAM-labeled Abeta were further investigated by coculture assay in which donor cells secrete one of the apoE isoforms and recipient cells express FL-LR11. The cellular uptake of extracellular Abeta into the recipient cells was most prominently accentuated when cocultured with the donor cells secreting apoE4 in the medium, followed by apoE3 and apoE2. Taken together, our results provide evidence for the mechanism whereby human-apoE-isoform-dependent differences modulate the cellular uptake of Abeta mediated by LR11/SorLA.

25484285|t|Altered GluN2B NMDA receptor function and synaptic plasticity during early pathology in the PS2APP mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
25484285|a|GluN2B subunit containing NMDARs (GluN2B-NMDARs) mediate pathophysiological effects of acutely applied amyloid beta (Abeta), including impaired long-term potentiation (LTP). However, in transgenic Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse models which feature gradual Abeta accumulation, the function of GluN2B-NMDARs and their contribution to synaptic plasticity are unknown. Therefore, we examined the role of GluN2B-NMDARs in synaptic function and plasticity in the hippocampus of PS2APP transgenic mice. Although LTP induced by theta burst stimulation (TBS) was normal in PS2APP mice, it was significantly reduced by the selective GluN2B-NMDAR antagonist Ro25-6981 (Ro25) in PS2APP mice, but not wild type (wt) mice. While NMDARs activated by single synaptic stimuli were not blocked by Ro25, NMDARs recruited during burst stimulation showed larger blockade by Ro25 in PS2APP mice. Thus, the unusual dependence of LTP on GluN2B-NMDARs in PS2APP mice suggests that non-synaptic GluN2B-NMDARs are activated by glutamate that spills out of synaptic cleft during the burst stimulation used to induce LTP. While long-term depression (LTD) was normal in PS2APP mice, and Ro25 had no impact on LTD in wt mice, Ro25 impaired LTD in PS2APP mice, again demonstrating aberrant GluN2B-NMDAR function during plasticity. Together these results demonstrate altered GluN2B-NMDAR function in a model of early AD pathology that has implications for the therapeutic targeting of NMDARs in AD.

25485684|t|Prostaglandin signaling suppresses beneficial microglial function in Alzheimer's disease models.
25485684|a|Microglia, the innate immune cells of the CNS, perform critical inflammatory and noninflammatory functions that maintain normal neural function. For example, microglia clear misfolded proteins, elaborate trophic factors, and regulate and terminate toxic inflammation. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), however, beneficial microglial functions become impaired, accelerating synaptic and neuronal loss. Better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that contribute to microglial dysfunction is an important objective for identifying potential strategies to delay progression to AD. The inflammatory cyclooxygenase/prostaglandin E2 (COX/PGE2) pathway has been implicated in preclinical AD development, both in human epidemiology studies and in transgenic rodent models of AD. Here, we evaluated murine models that recapitulate microglial responses to Abeta peptides and determined that microglia-specific deletion of the gene encoding the PGE2 receptor EP2 restores microglial chemotaxis and Abeta clearance, suppresses toxic inflammation, increases cytoprotective insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling, and prevents synaptic injury and memory deficits. Our findings indicate that EP2 signaling suppresses beneficial microglia functions that falter during AD development and suggest that inhibition of the COX/PGE2/EP2 immune pathway has potential as a strategy to restore healthy microglial function and prevent progression to AD.

25485987|t|Highly efficient blue electroluminescence based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence.
25485987|a|Organic compounds that exhibit highly efficient, stable blue emission are required to realize inexpensive organic light-emitting diodes for future displays and lighting applications. Here, we define the design rules for increasing the electroluminescence efficiency of blue-emitting organic molecules that exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence. We show that a large delocalization of the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital in these charge-transfer compounds enhances the rate of radiative decay considerably by inducing a large oscillator strength even when there is a small overlap between the two wavefunctions. A compound based on our design principles exhibited a high rate of fluorescence decay and efficient up-conversion of triplet excitons into singlet excited states, leading to both photoluminescence and internal electroluminescence quantum yields of nearly 100%. 

25486177|t|Analysis of motor function in 6-month-old male and female 3xTg-AD mice.
25486177|a|The 3xTg-AD mouse has high validity as a model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) because it develops both amyloid beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Human patients with AD typically develop motor deficits, which worsen as the disease progresses, but 3xTg-AD mice have been reported to show enhanced motor abilities. We investigated the motor behaviour phenotype of male and female 3xTg-AD and B6129SF2 wildtype mice on a battery of motor behaviours at 6 months of age. Compared to wildtype mice, the 3xTg-AD mice had enhanced motor performance on the Rotarod, but worse performance on the grid suspension task. In gait analysis 3xTg-AD mice had a longer stride length and made more foot slips on the balance beam than wildtype mice. There was no overall difference in voluntary wheel-running activity between genotypes, but there was a disruption in circadian activity rhythm in 3xTg-AD mice. In some motor tasks, such as the Rotarod and balance beam, females appeared to perform better than males, but this sex differences was accounted for by differences in body weight. Our results indicate that while the 3xTg-AD mice show enhanced performance on the Rotarod, they have poorer performance on other motor behaviour tasks, indicating that their motor behaviour phenotype is more complex than previously reported. The presence of the P301L transgene may explain the enhancement of Rotarod performance but the poorer performance on other motor behaviour tasks may be due to other transgenes.

25489598|t|Constraints to applying systems thinking concepts in health systems: A regional perspective from surveying stakeholders in Eastern Mediterranean countries.
25489598|a|BACKGROUND: Systems Thinking (ST) has recently been promoted as an important approach to health systems strengthening. However, ST is not common practice, particularly in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). This paper seeks to explore the barriers that may hinder its application in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) and possible strategies to mitigate them. METHODS: A survey consisting of open-ended questions was conducted with a purposive sample of health policy-makers such as senior officials from the Ministry of Health (MoH), researchers, and other stakeholders such as civil society groups and professional associations from ten countries in the region. A total of 62 respondents participated in the study. Thematic analysis was conducted. RESULTS: There was strong recognition of the relevance and usefulness of ST to health systems policy-making and research, although misconceptions about what ST means were also identified. Experience with applying ST was very limited. Approaches to designing health policies in the EMR were perceived as reactive and fragmented (66%). Commonly perceived constraints to application of ST were: a perceived notion of its costliness combined with lack of the necessary funding to operationalize it (53%), competing political interests and lack of government accountability (50%), lack of awareness about relevance and value (47%), limited capacity to apply it (45%), and difficulty in coordinating and managing stakeholders (39%). CONCLUSION: While several strategies have been proposed to mitigate most of these constraints, they emphasized the importance of political endorsement and adoption of ST at the leadership level, together with building the necessary capacity to apply it and apply the learning in research and practice.

25491073|t|Periodontal disease associates with higher brain amyloid load in normal elderly.
25491073|a|The accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques is a central feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). First reported in animal models, it remains uncertain if peripheral inflammatory and/or infectious conditions in humans can promote Abeta brain accumulation. Periodontal disease, a common chronic infection, has been previously reported to be associated with AD. Thirty-eight cognitively normal, healthy, and community-residing elderly (mean age, 61 and 68% female) were examined in an Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and a University-Based Dental School. Linear regression models (adjusted for age, apolipoprotein E, and smoking) were used to test the hypothesis that periodontal disease assessed by clinical attachment loss was associated with brain Abeta load using (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) positron emission tomography imaging. After adjusting for confounders, clinical attachment loss (>=3 mm), representing a history of periodontal inflammatory/infectious burden, was associated with increased PIB uptake in Abeta vulnerable brain regions (p = 0.002). We show for the first time in humans an association between periodontal disease and brain Abeta load. These data are consistent with the previous animal studies showing that peripheral inflammation/infections are sufficient to produce brain Abeta accumulations.

25492702|t|Tau aggregation and its interplay with amyloid-beta.
25492702|a|Neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques constitute the hallmark brain lesions of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Tangles are composed of fibrillar aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein tau, and plaques comprise fibrillar forms of a proteolytic cleavage product, amyloid-beta (Abeta). Although plaques and tangles are the end-stage lesions in AD, small oligomers of Abeta and tau are now receiving increased attention as they are shown to correlate best with neurotoxicity. One key question of debate, however, is which of these pathologies appears first and hence is upstream in the pathocascade. Studies suggest that there is an intense crosstalk between the two molecules and, based on work in animal models, there is increasing evidence that Abeta, at least in part, exerts its toxicity via tau, with the Src kinase Fyn playing a crucial role in this process. In other experimental paradigms, Abeta and tau have been found to exert both separate and synergistic modes of toxicity. The challenge, however, is to integrate these different scenarios into a coherent picture. Furthermore, the ability of therapeutic interventions targeting just one of these molecules, to successfully neutralize the toxicity of the other, needs to be ascertained to improve current therapeutic strategies, such as immunotherapy, for the treatment of AD. Although this article is not intended to provide a comprehensive review of the currently pursued therapeutic strategies, we will discuss what has been achieved by immunotherapy and, in particular, how the inherent limitations of this approach can possibly be overcome by novel strategies that involve single-chain antibodies.

25494036|t|Evidence of rapid coaggregation of globular proteins during amyloid formation.
25494036|a|The question of how an aggregating protein can influence aggregation of other proteins located in its vicinity is particularly significant because many proteins coexist in cells. We demonstrate in vitro coaggregation and cross-seeding of lysozyme, bovine serum albumin, insulin, and cytochrome c during their amyloid formation. The coaggregation process seems to be more dependent on the temperature-induced intermediate species of these proteins and less dependent on their sequence identities. Because amyloid-linked inclusions and plaques are recognized as multicomponent entities originating from aggregation of the associated protein, these findings may add new insights into the mechanistic understanding of amyloid-related pathologies.

25494801|t|Exploring the role of hydration and confinement in the aggregation of amyloidogenic peptides Abeta(16-22) and Sup35(7-13) in AOT reverse micelles.
25494801|a|Knowledge of how intermolecular interactions of amyloid-forming proteins cause protein aggregation and how those interactions are affected by sequence and solution conditions is essential to our understanding of the onset of many degenerative diseases. Of particular interest is the aggregation of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide, linked to Alzheimer's disease, and the aggregation of the Sup35 yeast prion peptide, which resembles the mammalian prion protein linked to spongiform encephalopathies. To facilitate the study of these important peptides, experimentalists have identified small peptide congeners of the full-length proteins that exhibit amyloidogenic behavior, including the KLVFFAE sub-sequence, Abeta16-22, and the GNNQQNY subsequence, Sup357-13. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations were used to examine these peptide fragments encapsulated in reverse micelles (RMs) in order to identify the fundamental principles that govern how sequence and solution environment influence peptide aggregation. Abeta16-22 and Sup357-13 are observed to organize into anti-parallel and parallel beta-sheet arrangements. Confinement in the sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate (AOT) reverse micelles is shown to stabilize extended peptide conformations and enhance peptide aggregation. Substantial fluctuations in the reverse micelle shape are observed, in agreement with earlier studies. Shape fluctuations are found to facilitate peptide solvation through interactions between the peptide and AOT surfactant, including direct interaction between non-polar peptide residues and the aliphatic surfactant tails. Computed amide I IR spectra are compared with experimental spectra and found to reflect changes in the peptide structures induced by confinement in the RM environment. Furthermore, examination of the rotational anisotropy decay of water in the RM demonstrates that the water dynamics are sensitive to the presence of peptide as well as the peptide sequence. Overall, our results demonstrate that the RM is a complex confining environment where substantial direct interaction between the surfactant and peptides plays an important role in determining the resulting ensemble of peptide conformations. By extension the results suggest that similarly complex sequence-dependent interactions may determine conformational ensembles of amyloid-forming peptides in a cellular environment.

25495832|t|Residual decline in cognition after adjustment for common neuropathologic conditions.
25495832|a|OBJECTIVE: Neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular conditions are common in old age and are associated with cognitive decline. However, considerable heterogeneity remains in residual decline (i.e., person-specific trajectories of cognitive decline adjusted for these common neuropathologic conditions). The present study aimed to characterize profiles of residual decline in late life cognition. METHOD: Up to 19 waves of longitudinal cognitive data were collected from 876 autopsied participants from 2 ongoing clinical-pathologic cohort studies of aging. Uniform neuropathologic examinations quantified measures of Alzheimer's disease, cerebral infarcts, Lewy body disease, and hippocampal sclerosis. Random effects mixture models characterized latent profiles of residual decline in global cognition. RESULTS: We identified 4 latent groups, and each group demonstrated distinct residual decline profiles. On average, 44% of the participants had little or no decline, 35% showed moderate decline, 13% showed severe decline and the rest (8%) had substantial within-subject fluctuation of longitudinal cognitive measures. These latent groups differed in psychological, experiential and neurobiologic factors that have been previously shown to be associated with cognitive decline. Specifically, compared with nondecliners, decliners had more depressive symptoms, were more socially isolated; were less engaged in cognitive or physical activities; and had lower density of noradrenergic neurons in locus ceruleus. CONCLUSIONS: After controlling for common dementia related pathologies, considerable residual variability remains in cognitive aging trajectories and this variability is not random but rather is related to markers of cognitive and neural reserve. The mixture modeling approach provides a powerful tool to identify latent groups with distinct cognitive trajectories.

25497018|t|Tumor necrosis factor-alpha reduces beta-amyloid accumulation primarily by lowering cellular prion protein levels in a brain endothelial cell line.
25497018|a|Disruption of beta-amyloid (Abeta) transport across the blood-brain barrier is thought to cause Abeta accumulation in the brain, thus leading to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As AD patients show increased serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) levels, we examined the effect of TNFalpha on the function and expression of Abeta transport-related proteins including cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) in the mouse brain microvascular endothelial cell line MBEC4. TNFalpha decreased PrP(C) levels and intracellular radiolabeled Abeta. Similarly, anti-prion protein antibody also decreased radiolabeled Abeta. These results suggest that TNFalpha lowers PrP(C) levels, which in turn, reduces Abeta in the brain endothelium.

25497604|t|Survival outcome of stage I ovarian clear cell carcinoma with lympho-vascular space invasion.
25497604|a|BACKGROUND: The clinical impact of lympho-vascular space invasion (LVSI) in early-stage ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) is not well understood. Given the distinct tumor biology and survival patterns of OCCC, the significance of LVSI on survival outcome and treatment response was examined in OCCC. METHODS: A multicenter study was conducted to examine stage IA-IC3 OCCC cases that underwent primary surgical staging including lymphadenectomy. LVSI status was determined from archived histopathology slides, correlated with clinico-pathological results, chemotherapy patterns, and survival outcomes. RESULTS: LVSI was observed in 47 (20.3%) among 232 cases. In univariate analysis, LVSI was associated with older age (p=0.042), large tumor size (p=0.048), and stage IC (p=0.035). In survival analysis, LVSI was associated with decreased disease-free survival (DFS, 5-year rate, 70.6% versus 92.1%, p=0.0004) and overall survival (OS, 78.8% versus 93.3%, p=0.008) on univariate analysis. After controlling for age, tumor size, stage, and chemotherapy use, LVSI remained an independent prognostic factor for decreased survival outcomes (DFS, hazard ratio [HR] 4.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.73-10.9, p=0.002; and OS, HR 4.73, 95%CI 1.60-14.0, p=0.015). Among 210 cases who received postoperative chemotherapy, while regimen type did not impact survival outcome regardless of LVSI status (DFS, p=0.63), the number of administered cycles showed a survival benefit towards >=6cycles for patients with LVSI-positive tumors (DFS, p=0.009; and OS, p=0.016). CONCLUSION: LVSI is an important marker to predict survival outcome of stage I OCCC. Regardless of chemotherapy type, patients with stage I OCCC showing LVSI may benefit from receiving postoperative chemotherapy.

25497764|t|Effect of amyloid beta-peptide on the fluidity of phosphatidylcholine membranes: Uses and limitations of diphenylhexatriene fluorescence anisotropy.
25497764|a|There is accumulating evidence that peptide-induced perturbations in the order and dynamics of cellular membranes may play a role in the neurotoxicity of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta). Several studies have reported that Abeta decreases fluidity of membranes based on an Abeta-induced increase in the fluorescence anisotropy of diphenylhexatriene (DPH). However, the effect of Abeta on the membrane fluidity is still a subject of controversy, because other studies that employed pyrene as a fluorescent probe have shown that Abeta has the opposite effect. To reveal the reason for this discrepancy, we have examined the effect of Abeta on the fluidity of phosphatidylcholine membranes using spectroscopic methods. The fluorescence anisotropy of DPH is dramatically increased on addition of Abeta to DPH-containing phosphatidylcholine membranes. However, Abeta does not affect the Raman spectrum of the membrane, which is sensitive to the packing order of the hydrocarbon chains of lipids. We have also found that circular dichroism (CD) bands of DPH appear during incubation of DPH-containing membranes with Abeta, whereas DPH is an achiral molecule. The observed CD bands of DPH are induced by a chiral environment of Abeta but not by that of the lipids, because positive CD bands appear regardless of the d/l-chirality of phosphatidylcholine. The findings obtained from CD measurements provide evidence that DPH molecules translocate from the membrane to Abeta. The peptide-mediated extraction of DPH from the membrane may cause changes in the fluorescence anisotropy of DPH, even though Abeta does not affect the fluidity of membranes.

25497960|t|Analysis of a compartmental model of amyloid beta production, irreversible loss and exchange in humans.
25497960|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides, and in particular Abeta42, are found in senile plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease. A compartmental model of Abeta production, exchange and irreversible loss was recently developed to explain the kinetics of isotope-labeling of Abeta peptides collected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) following infusion of stable isotope-labeled leucine in humans. The compartmental model allowed calculation of the rates of production, irreversible loss (or turnover) and short-term exchange of Abeta peptides. Exchange of Abeta42 was particularly pronounced in amyloid plaque-bearing participants. In the current work, we describe in much greater detail the characteristics of the compartmental model to two distinct audiences: physician-scientists and biokineticists. For physician-scientists, we describe through examples the types of questions the model can and cannot answer, as well as correct some misunderstandings of previous kinetic analyses applied to this type of isotope labeling data. For biokineticists, we perform a system identifiability analysis and a sensitivity analysis of the kinetic model to explore the global and local properties of the model. Combined, these analyses motivate simplifications from a more comprehensive physiological model to the final model that was previously presented. The analyses clearly demonstrate that the current dataset and compartmental model allow determination with confidence a single 'turnover' parameter, a single 'exchange' parameter and a single 'delay' parameter. When combined with CSF concentration data for the Abeta peptides, production rates may also be obtained.

25498198|t|Heparin nanoparticles for beta amyloid binding and mitigation of beta amyloid associated cytotoxicity.
25498198|a|Accumulation of beta amyloid (Abeta) in the brain is believed to play a key role in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Glycosaminoglycans on surface of neuronal cells can serve as nucleation sites to promote plaque formation on cell surface. To mimic this process, magnetic nanoparticles coated with heparin have been synthesized. The heparin nanoparticles were demonstrated to bind with Abeta through a variety of techniques including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, gel electrophoresis, and thioflavin T assay. The nanoparticle exhibited little toxicity to neuronal cells and at the same time can effectively protect them from Abeta induced cytotoxicity. These results suggest that heparin nanoparticles can be a very useful tool for Abeta studies.

25498712|t|A polysaccharide from Polygonatum sibiricum attenuates amyloid-beta-induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells.
25498712|a|One of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the progressive accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in the form of senile plaques, and Abeta induced neurotoxicity has been identified as a major cause of the onset of AD. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of a polysaccharide (PS-WNP) from Polygonatum sibiricum against the Abeta(25-35)-induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells and explored the underlying mechanism. The results showed that pretreatment with PS-WNP significantly attenuated cell death and the elevated Bax/Bcl-2 ratio evoked by Abeta(25-35), and subsequently inhibited mitochondrial dysfunction and cytochrome c release into the cytosol. Moreover, PS-WNP significantly inhibited Abeta(25-35) induced caspase-3 activation and enhanced the protein levels of phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) in PC12 cells. Additionally, pretreatment with the PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) completely abolished the protective effects of PS-WNP against Abeta(25-35)-induced neuronal cell apoptosis. These observations unambiguously suggested that the protective effect of PS-WNP against Abeta(25-35)-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells was associated with the enhancement of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

25499535|t|The transitional association between beta-amyloid pathology and regional brain atrophy.
25499535|a|INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) associated with brain atrophy and cognitive decline. The functional form to model the association between Abeta and regional brain atrophy has not been well defined. To determine the relationship between Abeta and atrophy, we compared the performance of the usual dichotomization of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta to identify subjects as Abeta+ and Abeta- with a trilinear spline model of CSF Abeta. METHODS: One hundred and eighty-three subjects with mild cognitive impairment and 108 cognitively normal controls with baseline CSF Abeta and up to 4 years of longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were analyzed using mixed-effects regression. Piecewise-linear splines were used to evaluate the nonlinear nature of the association between CSF Abeta and regional atrophy and to identify points of acceleration of atrophy with respect to Abeta. Several parameterizations of CSF Abeta were compared using likelihood ratio tests and the Akaike information criterion. Periods of acceleration of atrophy in which subjects transition from CSF Abeta negativity to CSF Abeta positivity were estimated from the spline models and tested for significance. RESULTS: Spline models resulted in better fits for many temporal and parietal regions compared with the dichotomous models. The trilinear model showed that periods of acceleration of atrophy varied greatly by region with early changes seen in the insula, amygdala, precuneus, hippocampus, and other temporal regions, occurring before the clinical threshold for CSF Abeta positivity. DISCUSSION: The use of piecewise-linear splines provides an improved model of the nonlinear association between CSF Abeta and regional atrophy in regions implicated in the progression of AD. The important biological finding of this work is that some brain regions show periods of accelerated volume loss well before the CSF Abeta42 threshold. This implies that signs of brain atrophy develop before the current conventional definition of "preclinical AD".

25499537|t|The triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is associated with enhanced inflammation, neuropathological lesions and increased risk for Alzheimer's dementia.
25499537|a|INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to elucidate the relationship between the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) risk variant, neuropathological lesions, alterations in gene and protein expression, and the severity of neuroinflammation. METHODS: The genetic association study of the R47 H TREM2 variant with Alzheimer's disease (AD), neuropathology, and changes in TREM2 and TYRO protein tyrosine kinase-binding protein (TYROBP) gene and protein expression, and neuroinflammatory markers. RESULTS: The TREM2 variant is associated with: (i) AD (odds ratio: 4.76; P = .014); (ii) increased density of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in multiple brain regions; (iii) increased TREM2 (P = .041) and TYROBP (P = .006) gene expression; (iv) decreased TREM2 protein levels (P = .016); and (v) upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted [RANTES] and interferon [IFN] gamma) (P = .003) and nominal downregulation of protective markers (alpha2-macroglobulin, interleukin 4 or IL-4, and ApoA1) (P = .018). DISCUSSION: These findings link the TREM2 missense mutation with specific molecular abnormalities and increases in neuropathological lesions in the human brain.

25500142|t|Early hyperactivity in lateral entorhinal cortex is associated with elevated levels of AbetaPP metabolites in the Tg2576 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
25500142|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder which is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly today. One of the earliest symptoms of AD is olfactory dysfunction. The present study investigated the effects of amyloid beta precursor protein (AbetaPP) metabolites, including amyloid-beta (Abeta) and AbetaPP C-terminal fragments (CTF), on olfactory processing in the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) using the Tg2576 mouse model of human AbetaPP over-expression. The entorhinal cortex is an early target of AD related neuropathology, and the LEC plays an important role in fine odor discrimination and memory. Cohorts of transgenic and age-matched wild-type (WT) mice at 3, 6, and 16months of age (MO) were anesthetized and acute, single-unit electrophysiology was performed in the LEC. Results showed that Tg2576 exhibited early LEC hyperactivity at 3 and 6MO compared to WT mice in both local field potential and single-unit spontaneous activity. However, LEC single-unit odor responses and odor receptive fields showed no detectable difference compared to WT at any age. Finally, the very early emergence of olfactory system hyper-excitability corresponded not to detectable Abeta deposition in the olfactory system, but rather to high levels of intracellular AbetaPP-CTF and soluble Abeta in the anterior piriform cortex (aPCX), a major afferent input to the LEC, by 3MO. The present results add to the growing evidence of AbetaPP-related hyper-excitability, and further implicate both soluble Abeta and non-Abeta AbetaPP metabolites in its early emergence.

25500888|t|CXCR3 promotes plaque formation and behavioral deficits in an Alzheimer's disease model.
25500888|a|Chemokines are important modulators of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. In the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and in AD animal models, the chemokine CXCL10 is found in high concentrations, suggesting a pathogenic role for this chemokine and its receptor, CXCR3. Recent studies aimed at addressing the role of CXCR3 in neurological diseases indicate potent, but diverse, functions for CXCR3. Here, we examined the impact of CXCR3 in the amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 1 (PS1) transgenic mouse model of AD. We found that, compared with control APP/PSI animals, plaque burden and Abeta levels were strongly reduced in CXCR3-deficient APP/PS1 mice. Analysis of microglial phagocytosis in vitro and in vivo demonstrated that CXCR3 deficiency increased the microglial uptake of Abeta. Application of a CXCR3 antagonist increased microglial Abeta phagocytosis, which was associated with reduced TNF-alpha secretion. Moreover, in CXCR3-deficient APP/PS1 mice, microglia exhibited morphological activation and reduced plaque association, and brain tissue from APP/PS1 animals lacking CXCR3 had reduced concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines compared with controls. Further, loss of CXCR3 attenuated the behavioral deficits observed in APP/PS1 mice. Together, our data indicate that CXCR3 signaling mediates development of AD-like pathology in APP/PS1 mice and suggest that CXCR3 has potential as a therapeutic target for AD.

25501055|t|Predictive accuracy of amyloid imaging for progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer disease with different lengths of follow-up: a meta-analysis. [Corrected].
25501055|a|In the past decade, amyloid deposition has been shown to begin many years before the clinical symptoms of dementia in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer disease (AD). Longitudinal studies with different follow-up durations have suggested that C-Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography (C-PIB-PET) may play a role in stratifying patients with MCI into risk levels for developing AD. However, the predictive accuracy of amyloid imaging for the progression from MCI to AD with different follow-up durations has not yet been systematically evaluated. A formal systematic evaluation of the sensitivity, specificity, and other properties of C-PIB-PET was performed.This study aimed to systematically review and meta-analyze published data on the diagnostic performance of C-PIB-PET for predicting conversion to AD in patients with MCI and to determine whether long-term follow-up has a positive effect on predictive accuracy. Relevant studies were systematically identified through electronic searches, which were performed in MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP), BIOSIS Previews (ISI Web of Knowledge), Science Citation Index (ISI Web of Knowledge), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), and LILACS (Bireme). The methodological quality of each study was assessed by QUADAS-2. Sensitivities and specificities of C-PIB-PET in individual studies were calculated, and the studies underwent meta-analysis with a random-effects model. A summary receiver-operating characteristic curve (SROC) was constructed with the Moses-Shapiro-Littenberg method. Pooled estimates of sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (LR+), negative likelihood ratio (LR-), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and the SROC curve of each subgroup were determined. Heterogeneity was tested, and potential sources for heterogeneity were explored by assessing whether certain covariates significantly influenced the relative DOR.Eleven eligible studies consisting of a total of 352 patients with MCI at baseline were included. Overall, the studies were of moderate-to-high methodological quality. The sensitivity and specificity of C-PIB-PET for predicting conversion to AD ranged from 83.3% to 100% and 41.1% to 100%, respectively, with pooled estimates of 94.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 89.8%-97.7%) and 57.2% (95% CI: 50.1%-64.2%), respectively . Moderate heterogeneity was observed for specificity between the included studies (I = 42.1%). The pooled estimates for the long-term follow-up subgroup were 95.5% sensitivity (95% CI: 84.5%-99.4%) and 72.4% specificity (95% CI: 59.1%-83.3.8%), whereas the pooled estimates for the short-term follow-up subgroup were 94.4% sensitivity (95% CI: 88.2%-97.9%) and 51.0% specificity (95% CI: 42.6%-59.5%). Homogeneity in each subgroup was significantly higher than that of the included studies, and most diagnostic indicators in the long-term follow-up subgroup were far superior to those in the short-term follow-up subgroup or the entire group. Not all of the methodological quality scores of studies included in this systematic review were high. Current evidence suggests that prolongation of the follow-up duration tended to yield greater accuracy of C-PIB-PET for predicting the progression from MCI to AD. In particular, the specificity, which reflects the exploratory nature of the use of amyloid imaging to identify the process of MCI to AD, was improved with a longer follow-up period.

25501500|t|Structural analysis of membrane-bound hECE-1 dimer using molecular modeling techniques: insights into conformational changes and Abeta1-42 peptide binding.
25501500|a|The human endothelin converting enzyme-1 (hECE-1) is a homodimer linked by a single disulfide bridge and has been identified as an important target for Alzheimer's disease. Structural analysis of hECE-1 dimer could lead to design specific and effective therapies against Alzheimer's disease. Hence, in the present study homology model of transmembrane helix has been constructed and patched with available crystal structure of hECE-1 monomer. Then, membrane-bound whole model of hECE-1 dimer has been developed by considering biophysical properties of membrane proteins. The explicit molecular dynamics simulation revealed that the hECE-1 dimer exhibits conformational restrains and controls total central cavity by regulating the degree of fluctuations in some residues (238-226) for substrate/product entrance/exit sites. In turn, conformational rearrangements of interdomain linkers as well as helices close to the inner surface are responsible for increasing total central cavity of hECE-1 dimer. Further, the model of hECE-1 dimer was docked with Abeta1-42 followed by MD simulation to investigate possible orientation and interactions of Abeta1-42 in catalytic groove of hECE-1 dimer. The free energy calculations exposed the stability of complex and helped us to identify key residues of hECE-1 involved in interactions with Abeta1-42 peptide. Hence, the present study might be useful to understand structural significance of membrane-bound dimeric hECE-1 to design therapies against Alzheimer's disease.

25501830|t|Heme oxygenase-1 protects against Alzheimer's amyloid-beta(1-42)-induced toxicity via carbon monoxide production.
25501830|a|Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an inducible enzyme up-regulated in Alzheimer's disease, catabolises heme to biliverdin, Fe2+ and carbon monoxide (CO). CO can protect neurones from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis by inhibiting Kv2.1 channels, which mediates cellular K+ efflux as an early step in the apoptotic cascade. Since apoptosis contributes to the neuronal loss associated with amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) toxicity in AD, we investigated the protective effects of HO-1 and CO against Abeta(1-42) toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells, employing cells stably transfected with empty vector or expressing the cellular prion protein, PrP(c), and rat primary hippocampal neurons. Abeta(1-42) (containing protofibrils) caused a concentration-dependent decrease in cell viability, attributable at least in part to induction of apoptosis, with the PrP(c)-expressing cells showing greater susceptibility to Abeta(1-42) toxicity. Pharmacological induction or genetic over-expression of HO-1 significantly ameliorated the effects of Abeta(1-42). The CO-donor CORM-2 protected cells against Abeta(1-42) toxicity in a concentration-dependent manner. Electrophysiological studies revealed no differences in the outward current pre- and post-Abeta(1-42) treatment suggesting that K+ channel activity is unaffected in these cells. Instead, Abeta toxicity was reduced by the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine, and by the CaMKKII inhibitor, STO-609. Abeta also activated the downstream kinase, AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK). CO prevented this activation of AMPK. Our findings indicate that HO-1 protects against Abeta toxicity via production of CO. Protection does not arise from inhibition of apoptosis-associated K+ efflux, but rather by inhibition of AMPK activation, which has been recently implicated in the toxic effects of Abeta. These data provide a novel, beneficial effect of CO which adds to its growing potential as a therapeutic agent.

25503578|t|Electromyographic pelvic floor activity: Is there impact during the female life cycle?
25503578|a|AIM: To evaluate the pelvic floor muscle (PFM) electromyographic activity in different phases of the female life cycle, correlating electromyographic activity with age, Body Mass Index (BMI), parity as well as the presence and severity of urinary symptoms. METHODS: A clinical, observational, transversal and controlled study was conducted in 384 women: 49 nulliparous, 103 primigravid pregnant, 92 primiparous postpartum (vaginal delivery: n = 43; cesarean section delivery: n = 49), 22 climacteric, 65 postmenopausal, and 53 women identified as being unable to perform voluntary maximum contraction. All subjects were evaluated with digital palpation and PFM surface electromyography (sEMG) and completed the questionnaires: International Consultation on Incontinence Urinary Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ IU-SF) and International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire Overactive Bladder (ICIQ-OAB). Spearman's Correlation Coefficient and ANOVA were used to analyze the variables. RESULTS: The nulliparous women had higher PFM electromyographic activity than the other groups. The primigravid pregnant, cesarean section and vaginal delivery groups had higher electromyographic activity than the postmenopausal group. Studying PFM electromyographic activity with the factors evaluated, a negative correlation between age, parity, and the presence and severity of urinary symptoms was observed. There was no correlation between PFM electromyographic activity and BMI. CONCLUSION: Fourteen percent of women participating were not able to perform active contraction of the PFM. PFM electromyographic activity changed during the female life cycle. PFM electromyographic activity correlated inversely with age, parity, and the presence and severity of urinary symptoms.

25510196|t|Hesperidin ameliorates behavioral impairments and neuropathology of transgenic APP/PS1 mice.
25510196|a|In addition to cognitive impairments, deficits in non-cognitive behaviors are also common neurological sequelae in Alzheimer's disease and its animal models. Hesperidin, a flavanone glycoside found abundantly in citrus fruits, was orally given (100 mg/kg body weight) to 5-month-old transgenic APP/PS1 mice, a mouse model of cerebral amyloidosis for Alzheimer's disease. After a relatively short-term treatment of 10 days, hesperidin significantly restored deficits in non-cognitive nesting ability and social interaction. Further immunohistochemical analysis showed significantly attenuated beta-amyloid deposition, plaque associated APP expression, microglial activation and TGF-beta immunoreactivity in brains of APP/PS1 mice, which suggests that ameliorated behavioral impairments might be attributable to reduced Abeta deposition and attenuated neuro-inflammatory reaction. Additionally, efficient anti-inflammatory effects of hesperidin were confirmed in vitro. Our findings suggest that hesperidin might be a potential candidate for the treatment of AD or even other neurodegenerative diseases.

25511894|t|Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in trials for Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases.
25511894|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) and Parkinson disease (PD) are the most common neurodegenerative disorders. For both diseases, early intervention is thought to be essential to the success of disease-modifying treatments. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can reflect some of the pathophysiological changes that occur in the brain, and the number of CSF biomarkers under investigation in neurodegenerative conditions has grown rapidly in the past 20 years. In AD, CSF biomarkers are increasingly being used in clinical practice, and have been incorporated into the majority of clinical trials to demonstrate target engagement, to enrich or stratify patient groups, and to find evidence of disease modification. In PD, CSF biomarkers have not yet reached the clinic, but are being studied in patients with parkinsonism, and are being used in clinical trials either to monitor progression or to demonstrate target engagement and downstream effects of drugs. CSF biomarkers might also serve as surrogate markers of clinical benefit after a specific therapeutic intervention, although additional data are required. It is anticipated that CSF biomarkers will have an important role in trials aimed at disease modification in the near future. In this Review, we provide an overview of CSF biomarkers in AD and PD, and discuss their role in clinical trials.

25515893|t|Screening and classifying small-molecule inhibitors of amyloid formation using ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry.
25515893|a|The search for therapeutic agents that bind specifically to precursor protein conformations and inhibit amyloid assembly is an important challenge. Identifying such inhibitors is difficult because many protein precursors of aggregation are partially folded or intrinsically disordered, which rules out structure-based design. Furthermore, inhibitors can act by a variety of mechanisms, including specific or nonspecific binding, as well as colloidal inhibition. Here we report a high-throughput method based on ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (IMS-MS) that is capable of rapidly detecting small molecules that bind to amyloid precursors, identifying the interacting protein species and defining the mode of inhibition. Using this method we have classified a variety of small molecules that are potential inhibitors of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) aggregation or amyloid-beta 1-40 aggregation as specific, nonspecific, colloidal or non-interacting. We also demonstrate the ability of IMS-MS to screen for inhibitory small molecules in a 96-well plate format and use this to discover a new inhibitor of hIAPP amyloid assembly.

25516078|t|International committee for monitoring assisted reproductive technologies: world report on assisted reproductive technologies, 2007.
25516078|a|OBJECTIVE: To analyze information on assisted reproductive technology (ART) performed worldwide, and trends in outcomes over successive years. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey on access, efficiency, and safety of ART procedures performed in 55 countries during 2007. SETTING: Not applicable. PATIENT(S): Infertile women and men undergoing ART globally. INTERVENTION(S): Collection and analysis of international ART data. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Number of cycles performed, by country and region, including pregnancies, single and multiple birth rates, and perinatal mortality. RESULT(S): Overall, >1,251,881 procedures with ART were reported, and resulted in 229,442 reported babies born. The availability of ART varied by country, from 12 to 4,140 treatments per million population. Of all aspiration cycles, 65.2% (400,617 of 614,540) were intracytoplasmic sperm injection. The overall delivery rate per fresh aspiration was 20.3%, and for frozen-embryo transfer (FET), 18.4%, with a cumulative delivery rate of 25.8%. With wide regional variations, single-embryo transfer represented 23.4% of fresh transfers, and the proportion of deliveries with twins and triplets from fresh transfers was 22.3% and 1.2%, respectively. The perinatal mortality rate was 19.9 per 1,000 births for fresh in vitro fertilization using intracytoplasmic sperm injection, and 9.6 per 1,000 for FET. The proportion of women aged >=40 years increased to 19.8% from 15.5% in 2006. CONCLUSION(S): The international trend toward <3 transferred embryos continued, as did the wider uptake of FET. This was achieved without compromising delivery rates. The application of ART for women aged >40 years was a major component of ART services in some regions and countries.

25517155|t|The structure of misfolded amyloidogenic dimers: computational analysis of force spectroscopy data.
25517155|a|Progress in understanding the molecular mechanism of self-assembly of amyloidogenic proteins and peptides requires knowledge about their structure in misfolded states. Structural studies of amyloid aggregates formed during the early aggregation stage are very limited. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) spectroscopy is widely used to analyze misfolded proteins and peptides, but the structural characterization of transiently formed misfolded dimers is limited by the lack of computational approaches that allow direct comparison with AFM experiments. Steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulation is capable of modeling force spectroscopy experiments, but the modeling requires pulling rates 10(7) times higher than those used in AFM experiments. In this study, we describe a computational all-atom Monte Carlo pulling (MCP) approach that enables us to model results at pulling rates comparable to those used in AFM pulling experiments. We tested the approach by modeling pulling experimental data for I91 from titin I-band (PDB ID: 1TIT) and ubiquitin (PDB ID: 1UBQ). We then used MCP to analyze AFM spectroscopy experiments that probed the interaction of the peptides [Q6C] Sup35 (6-13) and [H13C] Abeta (13-23). A comparison of experimental results with the computational data for the Sup35 dimer with out-of-register and in-register arrangements of beta-sheets suggests that Sup35 monomers adopt an out-of-register arrangement in the dimer. A similar analysis performed for Abeta peptide demonstrates that the out-of-register antiparallel beta-sheet arrangement of monomers also occurs in this peptide. Although the rupture of hydrogen bonds is the major contributor to dimer dissociation, the aromatic-aromatic interaction also contributes to the dimer rupture process.

25523106|t|Amyloid-beta disrupts ongoing spontaneous activity in sensory cortex.
25523106|a|UNLABELLED: The effect of Alzheimer's disease pathology on activity of individual neocortical neurons in the intact neural network remains obscure. Ongoing spontaneous activity, which constitutes most of neocortical activity, is the background template on which further evoked-activity is superimposed. We compared in vivo intracellular recordings and local field potentials (LFP) of ongoing activity in the barrel cortex of APP/PS1 transgenic mice and age-matched littermate CONTROLS, following significant amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation and aggregation. We found that membrane potential dynamics of neurons in Abeta-burdened cortex significantly differed from those of nontransgenic CONTROLS: durations of the depolarized state were considerably shorter, and transitions to that state frequently failed. The spiking properties of APP/PS1 neurons showed alterations from those of CONTROLS: both firing patterns and spike shape were changed in the APP/PS1 group. At the population level, LFP recordings indicated reduced coherence within neuronal assemblies of APP/PS1 mice. In addition to the physiological effects, we show that morphology of neurites within the barrel cortex of the APP/PS1 model is altered compared to CONTROLS. These results are consistent with a process where the effect of Abeta on spontaneous activity of individual neurons amplifies into a network effect, reducing network integrity and leading to a wide cortical dysfunction.

25525276|t|SorLA complement-type repeat domains protect the amyloid precursor protein against processing.
25525276|a|SorLA is a neuronal sorting receptor that is genetically associated with Alzheimer disease. SorLA interacts directly with the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and affects the processing of the precursor, leading to a decreased generation of the amyloid-beta peptide. The SorLA complement-type repeat (CR) domains associate in vitro with APP, but the precise molecular determinants of SorLA APP complex formation and the mechanisms responsible for the effect of binding on APP processing have not yet been elucidated. Here, we have generated protein expression constructs for SorLA devoid of the 11 CR-domains and for two SorLA mutants harboring substitutions of the fingerprint residues in the central CR-domains. We generated SH-SY5Y cell lines that stably express these SorLA variants to study the binding and processing of APP using co-immunoprecipitation and Western blotting/ELISAs, respectively. We found that the SorLA CR-cluster is essential for interaction with APP and that deletion of the CR-cluster abolishes the protection against APP processing. Mutation of identified fingerprint residues in the SorLA CR-domains leads to changes in the O-linked glycosylation of APP when expressed in SH-SY5Y cells. Our results provide novel information on the mechanisms behind the influence of SorLA activity on APP metabolism by controlling post-translational glycosylation in the Golgi, suggesting new strategies against amyloidogenesis in Alzheimer disease.

25528746|t|Insects associated with Jatropha curcas Linn. (Euphorbiaceae) in west Niger.
25528746|a|Jatropha curcas has been introduced into Niger since 2004 by International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT). This plant is cultivated for its oil, which can be used as a Biofuel. Through direct and indirect insect collection methods, an inventory of the insect associated with J. curcas has been conducted in Western Niger during two rainy seasons (from June to October) in 2010 and 2011. We have identified insects belonging to the following families: Acrididae (Oedaleus senegalensis Krauss, Oedaleus nigeriensis Uvarov, Heteracris leani Uvarov, Catantops stramineus Walker, Parga cyanoptera Uvarov, and Acanthacris ruficornis citrina Audinet-Serville), Pyrgomorphidae (Poekilocerus bufonius hieroglyphicus Klug), Cetoniidae (Pachnoda interrupta Olivier, Pachnoda marginata aurantia Herbst, Pachnoda sinuata Heinrich and McClain, and Rhabdotis sobrina Gory and Percheron), Meloidae (Decapotoma lunata Pallas), Pentatomidae (Agonoscelis versicoloratus Dallas, Nezara viridula Linn, and Antestia sp. Kirkaldy), Coreidae (Leptoglossus membranaceus Fabricius and Cletus trigonus Thunberg), and Scutelleridae (Calidea panaethiopica Kirkaldy). Origin and potential impact on J. curcas of all these insect species are presented and discussed. The lower insect's diversity indexes are observed in 2010 and 2011 for Niamey, Saga, and Gaya because of semi-arid character of the Sahelian area.

25529008|t|Introduction of a fluorescent probe to amyloid-beta to reveal kinetic insights into its interactions with copper(II).
25529008|a|The kinetics of the interactions between amyloid-beta (Abeta) and metal ions are crucial to understanding the physiological and pathological roles of Abeta in the normal brain and in Alzheimer's disease. Using the quenching of a fluorescent probe by Cu(2+), the mechanism of Abeta/Cu(2+) interactions in physiologically relevant conditions has been elucidated. Cu(2+) binds to Abeta at a near diffusion-limited rate, initially forming component I. The switching between component I and II occurs on the second timescale, with a significant energy barrier. Component I is much more reactive towards Cu(2+) ligands and likely responsible for initial Abeta dimer formation. Clioquinol (CQ) is shown to sequester Cu(2+) more effectively than other tested ligands. These findings have implications for the potential roles of Abeta in regulating neurotransmission, and for the screening of small molecules targeting Abeta-metal interactions.

25531084|t|Towards non-invasive diagnostic imaging of early-stage Alzheimer's disease.
25531084|a|One way to image the molecular pathology in Alzheimer's disease is by positron emission tomography using probes that target amyloid fibrils. However, these fibrils are not closely linked to the development of the disease. It is now thought that early-stage biomarkers that instigate memory loss are composed of Abeta oligomers. Here, we report a sensitive molecular magnetic resonance imaging contrast probe that is specific for Abeta oligomers. We attach oligomer-specific antibodies onto magnetic nanostructures and show that the complex is stable and binds to Abeta oligomers on cells and brain tissues to give a magnetic resonance imaging signal. When intranasally administered to an Alzheimer's disease mouse model, the probe readily reached hippocampal Abeta oligomers. In isolated samples of human brain tissue, we observed a magnetic resonance imaging signal that distinguished Alzheimer's disease from controls. Such nanostructures that target neurotoxic Abeta oligomers are potentially useful for evaluating the efficacy of new drugs and ultimately for early-stage Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and disease management.

25533203|t|Cerebrospinal fluid levels of the synaptic protein neurogranin correlates with cognitive decline in prodromal Alzheimer's disease.
25533203|a|INTRODUCTION: Synaptic dysfunction is an early event in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis and directly related to cognitive impairment. Consequently, synaptic biomarkers may be valuable tools for both early diagnosis and disease stage. Neurogranin (Ng) is a postsynaptic protein involved in memory consolidation. METHODS: We developed three monoclonal anti-Ng antibodies. Mass spectrometry and a novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to analyze cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Ng in three independent clinical cohorts including patients with AD dementia (n = 100 in total), mild cognitive impairment patients (MCI), (n = 40) and controls (n = 80 in total). RESULTS: We show in three independent clinical cohorts a marked increase in CSF Ng levels in AD dementia (P < .001 in all studies). In addition, high CSF Ng levels at the MCI stage predicted progression to dementia due to AD with a hazard ratio of 12.8 (95% confidence interval 1.6-103.0, P = .02). In amyloid-positive MCI patients, high CSF Ng correlated with a more rapid change in cognition during clinical follow-up (P = .03). DISCUSSION: These results suggest that CSF Ng is a novel AD biomarker that may be used to monitor synaptic degeneration, and correlates with the rate of cognitive decline in prodromal AD.

A ring-like aggregation of amyloid Abeta(1-40) on N-isobutyryl-L-cysteine (L-NIBC)-modified gold substrate occurs at low Abeta(1-40) concentration, while D-NIBC modification only results in rod-like aggregation. Utilizing atomic force microscope controlled tip-enhanced Raman scattering, we directly observe the secondary structure information for Abeta(1-40) assembly in situ at the nanoscale. D- or L-NIBC on the surface can guide parallel or nonparallel alignment of beta-hairpins through a two-step process based on electrostatic-interaction-enhanced adsorption and subsequent stereoselective recognition. Possible electrostatic interaction sites (R5 and K16) and a chiral recognition site (H14) of Abeta(1-40) are proposed, which may provide insight into the understanding of this effect.

25533879|t|The accuracy of emergency department medication history as determined by mass spectrometry analysis of urine: a pilot study.
25533879|a|BACKGROUND: Emergency Department (ED) medication lists (ML) are considered inaccurate based on previous comparisons of ED ML with patients' self-reporting of medications and reviews of patients' pharmacy and medical records. OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of ED ML using mass spectrometry analysis of urine samples. METHODS: This was a prospective observational study conducted at an urban tertiary care university hospital. Convenience sampling of patients who underwent ED triage was done. Included were patients 18 years or older who were capable of providing informed consent and who reported use of at least one medication. Excluded were patients unable to consent, prisoners, non-English-speaking patients, and patients unwilling or unable to provide a urine sample. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed on enrolled patients' urine, and their ED triage ML were recorded. Urinalysis results were compared to ED triage ML. Concordance between respective ED triage ML and urinalysis results was determined. Medications were grouped by medication class. The top five discrepant medication classes were identified. RESULTS: There were 100 patients enrolled; 21 patients, although eligible, did not provide a urine sample and were excluded, and one patient withdrew. Mean age was 51 years, and 54 patients were male. Twenty-two medication classes were identified. No patient had 100% concordance of ED triage ML and urinalysis results. Opioid analgesic, sedative hypnotics, cardiac, psychiatric, and nonopioid analgesic medications were the top discrepant medication classes. CONCLUSIONS: ED triage ML obtained by patient recall are inaccurate when compared to medications detected in urine using mass spectrometry analysis.

25534024|t|Differential induction and spread of tau pathology in young PS19 tau transgenic mice following intracerebral injections of pathological tau from Alzheimer's disease or corticobasal degeneration brains.
25534024|a|Filamentous tau pathologies are hallmark lesions of several neurodegenerative tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD) which show cell type-specific and topographically distinct tau inclusions. Growing evidence supports templated transmission of tauopathies through functionally interconnected neuroanatomical pathways suggesting that different self-propagating strains of pathological tau could account for the diverse manifestations of neurodegenerative tauopathies. Here, we describe the rapid and distinct cell type-specific spread of pathological tau following intracerebral injections of CBD or AD brain extracts enriched in pathological tau (designated CBD-Tau and AD-Tau, respectively) in young human mutant P301S tau transgenic (Tg) mice (line PS19) ~6-9 months before they show onset of mutant tau transgene-induced tau pathology. At 1 month post-injection of CBD-Tau, tau inclusions developed predominantly in oligodendrocytes of the fimbria and white matter near the injection sites with infrequent intraneuronal tau aggregates. In contrast, injections of AD-Tau in young PS19 mice induced tau pathology predominantly in neuronal perikarya with little or no oligodendrocyte involvement 1 month post-injection. With longer post-injection survival intervals of up to 6 months, CBD-Tau- and AD-Tau-induced tau pathology spread to different brain regions distant from the injection sites while maintaining the cell type-specific pattern noted above. Finally, CA3 neuron loss was detected 3 months post-injection of AD-Tau but not CBD-Tau. Thus, AD-Tau and CBD-Tau represent specific pathological tau strains that spread differentially and may underlie distinct clinical and pathological features of these two tauopathies. Hence, these strains could become targets to develop disease-modifying therapies for CBD and AD.

25534025|t|Neuropathology and biochemistry of Abeta and its aggregates in Alzheimer's disease.
25534025|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by beta-amyloid plaques and intraneuronal tau aggregation usually associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Both beta-amyloid plaques and CAA deposits contain fibrillar aggregates of the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta). Abeta plaques and CAA develop first in neocortical areas of preclinical AD patients and, then, expand in a characteristic sequence into further brain regions with end-stage pathology in symptomatic AD patients. Abeta aggregates are not restricted to amyloid plaques and CAA. Soluble and several types of insoluble non-plaque- and non-CAA-associated Abeta aggregates have been described. Amyloid fibrils are products of a complex self-assembly process that involves different types of transient intermediates. Amongst these intermediate species are protofibrils and oligomers. Different variants of Abeta peptides may result from alternative processing or from mutations that lead to rare forms of familial AD. These variants can exhibit different self-assembly and aggregation properties. In addition, several post-translational modifications of Abeta have been described that result, for example, in the production of N-terminal truncated Abeta with pyroglutamate modification at position 3 (AbetaN3pE) or of Abeta phosphorylated at serine 8 (pSer8Abeta). Both AbetaN3pE and pSer8Abeta show enhanced aggregation into oligomers and fibrils. However, the earliest detectable soluble and insoluble Abeta aggregates in the human brain exhibit non-modified Abeta, whereas AbetaN3pE and pSer8Abeta are detected in later stages. This finding indicates the existence of different biochemical stages of Abeta aggregate maturation with pSer8Abeta being related mainly to cases with symptomatic AD. The conversion from preclinical to symptomatic AD could thereby be related to combined effects of increased Abeta concentration, maturation of aggregates and spread of deposits into additional brain regions. Thus, the inhibition of Abeta aggregation and maturation before entering the symptomatic stage of the disease as indicated by the accumulation of pSer8Abeta may represent an attractive treatment strategy for preventing disease progression.

25534236|t|Cerebellin 4, a synaptic protein, enhances inhibitory activity and resistance of neurons to amyloid-beta toxicity.
25534236|a|Imbalances between excitatory and inhibitory transmissions in the brain anticipate the neuronal damage and death that occur in the neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). We previously showed that amyloid-beta (Ass), a natural peptide involved in the onset and development of AD, counteracts the neurotrophic activity of the nerve growth factor (NGF) by dampening the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic connectivity of cultured hippocampal neurons. Neuronal plasticity is partly controlled by the NGF-promoted expression of the homologue of enhancer-of-split 1 (Hes1), a transcription factor that regulates the formation of GABAergic synapses. We now show that Hes1 controls the expression of cerebellin 4 (Cbln4), a member of a small family of secreted synaptic proteins, and we present the evidence that Cbln4 plays an essential role in the formation and maintenance of inhibitory GABAergic connections. Cbln4 immunoreactivity was found in the hippocampus, mostly in the dendrites and somata of pyramidal neurons. In the CA1, the hippocampal region where the first neurons degenerate in AD, Cbln4 immunoreactivity was associated with GABAergic synapses (detected by vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter [VGAT] immunostaining), which appear to surround and embrace the somata of CA1 pyramidal neurons (basket cells). Moreover, significant decreases of Hes1, Cbln4, and VGAT immunoreactivities and messenger RNA expression were found in the hippocampus of a mouse model of AD. We also found that either the overexpression of Cbln4 in cultured hippocampal neurons or the application of recombinant Cbln4 to the cultures increased the number of GABAergic varicosities, rescuing neurons from Ass-induced death. In contrast, knockdown of Cbln4 gene in cultured neurons was followed by a large reduction of GABAergic connections. Such an effect was reverted by exogenously added Cbln4. These findings suggest a therapeutic potential for Cbln4 in the treatment of AD.

25534595|t|Evaluation of the effects of amyloid beta aggregation from seaweed extracts by a microliter-scale high-throughput screening system with a quantum dot nanoprobe.
25534595|a|Inhibitors of amyloid beta (Abeta) aggregation have the potential to serve as lead compounds for anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD) agents because Abeta aggregation is a key step in AD pathogenesis. Recently, we developed a novel microliter-scale high-throughput screening (MSHTS) system for Abeta aggregation inhibitors that applied fluorescence microscopic analysis with quantum dot nanoprobes, and attempted to comprehensively screen the inhibitors from spices using this system (Ishigaki et al., PLoS One, 8, e72992, 2013). In this study, we tried to evaluate the inhibitory activities of 11 seaweed extracts on Abeta aggregation using the MSHTS system. The half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of the ethanolic extracts from all seaweeds exceeded 4.9 mg/ml, indicating that the extracts inhibit Abeta aggregation although this activity was significantly lower than that displayed by members of the Lamiaceae, a family of herbal spices that showed highest activity among 52 spices tested in our 2013 study. On the other hand, the EC50 of boiling water extracts was 0.013-0.42 mg/ml which was comparable with the EC50 of the extracts from the Lamiaceae family. These results suggest that the extraction efficiency of the inhibitors by boiling water extraction was higher than that by ethanolic extraction. Moreover, analysis of fluorescence micrographs, which were obtained from the MSHTS system, revealed that the morphology of the Abeta aggregates coincubated with boiling water extracts differed from control aggregates, suggesting that the MSHTS system is also useful for screening substances that affect the morphology of aggregates.

25537424|t|Advances in the therapy of Alzheimer's disease: targeting amyloid beta and tau and perspectives for the future.
25537424|a|Worldwide multidisciplinary translational research has led to a growing knowledge of the genetics and molecular pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) indicating that pathophysiological brain alterations occur decades before clinical signs and symptoms of cognitive decline can be diagnosed. Consequently, therapeutic concepts and targets have been increasingly focused on early-stage illness before the onset of dementia; and distinct classes of compounds are now being tested in clinical trials. At present, there is a growing consensus that therapeutic progress in AD delaying disease progression would significantly decrease the expanding global burden. The evolving hypothesis- and evidence-based generation of new diagnostic research criteria for early-stage AD has positively impacted the development of clinical trial designs and the characterization of earlier and more specific target populations for trials in prodromal as well as in pre- and asymptomatic at-risk stages of AD.

25540951|t|Charting a path toward combination therapy for Alzheimer's disease.
25540951|a|It is acknowledged that progress in combined therapeutic approaches for Alzheimer's disease (AD) will require an unprecedented level of collaboration. At a meeting co-hosted by the Accelerate Cure/Treatments for Alzheimer's Disease Coalition and the Critical Path Institute, investigators from industry, academia and regulatory agencies agreed on the need for combinatorial approaches to treating AD. The need for advancing multiple targets includes recognition for novel adaptive trial designs that incorporate existing and new biomarkers to evaluate drug effects independently and in combination. A combination trial now being planned may test drugs targeting different pathogenic pathways or multiple targets along a common pathway. Collaborations and consortia-based strategies are pivotal for success and a regulatory framework is recommended for success.

25541191|t|Independent information from cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta and florbetapir imaging in Alzheimer's disease.
25541191|a|Reduced cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta42 and increased retention of florbetapir positron emission tomography are biomarkers reflecting cortical amyloid load in Alzheimer's disease. However, these measurements do not always agree and may represent partly different aspects of the underlying Alzheimer's disease pathology. The goal of this study was therefore to test if cerebrospinal fluid and positron emission tomography amyloid-beta biomarkers are independently related to other Alzheimer's disease markers, and to examine individuals who are discordantly classified by these two biomarker modalities. Cerebrospinal fluid and positron emission tomography amyloid-beta were measured at baseline in 769 persons [161 healthy controls, 68 subjective memory complaints, 419 mild cognitive impairment and 121 Alzheimer's disease dementia, mean age 72 years (standard deviation 7 years), 47% females] and used to predict diagnosis, APOE epsilon4 carriage status, cerebral blood flow, cerebrospinal fluid total-tau and phosphorylated-tau levels (cross-sectionally); and hippocampal volume, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography results and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale scores (longitudinally). Cerebrospinal fluid and positron emission tomography amyloid-beta were highly correlated, but adjusting one of these predictors for the other revealed that they both provided partially independent information when predicting diagnosis, APOE epsilon4, hippocampal volume, metabolism, cognition, total-tau and phosphorylated-tau (the 95% confidence intervals of the adjusted effects did not include zero). Cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta was more strongly related to APOE epsilon4 whereas positron emission tomography amyloid-beta was more strongly related to tau levels (P < 0.05). Discordance (mainly isolated cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta positivity) differed by diagnostic group (P < 0.001) and was seen in 21% of cognitively healthy people but only 6% in dementia patients. The finding that cerebrospinal fluid and positron emission tomography amyloid-beta provide partially independent information about a wide range of Alzheimer's measures supports the theory that these modalities represent partly different aspects of Alzheimer's pathology. The fact that mismatch, with positive cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta but normal positron emission tomography amyloid-beta, is relatively common in cognitively healthy people may be considered when using these biomarkers to identify early stage Alzheimer's disease. Reduced cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta may be more strongly related to early stage Alzheimer's disease, whereas increased positron emission tomography amyloid-beta may be more strongly related to disease progression.

25541422|t|Intraneuronal Abeta accumulation induces hippocampal neuron hyperexcitability through A-type K(+) current inhibition mediated by activation of caspases and GSK-3.
25541422|a|Amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) pathologies have been linked to dysfunction of excitability in neurons of the hippocampal circuit, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this process are still poorly understood. Here, we applied whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology to primary hippocampal neurons and show that intracellular Abeta42 delivery leads to increased spike discharge and action potential broadening through downregulation of A-type K(+) currents. Pharmacologic studies showed that caspases and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) activation are required for these Abeta42-induced effects. Extracellular perfusion and subsequent internalization of Abeta42 increase spike discharge and promote GSK-3-dependent phosphorylation of the Kv4.2 alpha-subunit, a molecular determinant of A-type K(+) currents, at Ser-616. In acute hippocampal slices derived from an adult triple-transgenic Alzheimer's mouse model, characterized by endogenous intracellular accumulation of Abeta42, CA1 pyramidal neurons exhibit hyperexcitability accompanied by increased phosphorylation of Kv4.2 at Ser-616. Collectively, these data suggest that intraneuronal Abeta42 accumulation leads to an intracellular cascade culminating into caspases activation and GSK-3-dependent phosphorylation of Kv4.2 channels. These findings provide new insights into the toxic mechanisms triggered by intracellular Abeta42 and offer potentially new therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's disease treatment.

25542589|a|A series of coumarin derivatives were designed, synthesized, and evaluated as novel multifunctional agents against Alzheimer's disease (AD). In vitro studies showed that most of these compounds exhibited significant potency to inhibit hMAO-B selectively and self-induced Abeta1-42 aggregation. In particular, compound 13 presented the greatest potential to inhibit hMAO-B (IC50=0.081muM, SI >1234) and good inhibition of Abeta1-42 aggregation (52.9% at 20muM). Moreover, compound 13 could function as a metal-chelator, penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and show low cell toxicity in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) and SH-SY5Y cells. Taken together, these results suggested that compound 13 might be a promising multifunctional agent for AD treatment.

25543023|t|Running exercise delays neurodegeneration in amygdala and hippocampus of Alzheimer's disease (APP/PS1) transgenic mice.
25543023|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease. Post-mortem examination and brain imaging studies indicate that neurodegeneration is evident in the hippocampus and amygdala of very early stage AD patients. Exercise training is known to enhance hippocampus- and amygdala-associated neuronal function. Here, we investigated the effects of exercise (running) on the neuronal structure and function of the hippocampus and amygdala in APP/PS1 transgenic (Tg) mice. At 4-months-old, an age before amyloid deposition, the amygdala-associated, but not the hippocampus-associated, long-term memory was impaired in the Tg mice. The dendritic complexities of the amygdalar basolateral neurons, but not those in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 neurons, were reduced. Furthermore, the levels of BDNF/TrkB signaling molecules (i.e. p-TrkB, p-Akt and p-PKC) were reduced in the amygdala, but not in the hippocampus of the 4-month-old Tg mice. The concentrations of Abeta40 and Abeta42 in the amygdala were higher than those in the hippocampus. Ten weeks of treadmill training (from 1.5- to 4-month-old) increased the hippocampus-associated memory and dendritic arbor of the CA1 and CA3 neurons, and also restored the amygdala-associated memory and the dendritic arbor of amygdalar basolateral neurons in the Tg mice. Similarly, exercise training also increased the levels of p-TrkB, p-AKT and p-PKC in the hippocampus and amygdala. Furthermore, exercise training reduced the levels of soluble Abeta in the amygdala and hippocampus. Exercise training did not change the levels of APP or RAGE, but significantly increased the levels of LRP-1 in both brain regions of the Tg mice. In conclusion, our results suggest that tests of amygdala function should be incorporated into subject selection for early prevention trials. Long-term exercise protects neurons in the amygdala and hippocampus against AD-related degeneration, probably via enhancements of BDNF signaling pathways and Abeta clearance. Physical exercise may serve as a means to delay the onset of AD.

25543257|t|Modeling an in-register, parallel "iowa" abeta fibril structure using solid-state NMR data from labeled samples with rosetta.
25543257|a|Determining the structures of amyloid fibrils is an important first step toward understanding the molecular basis of neurodegenerative diseases. For beta-amyloid (Abeta) fibrils, conventional solid-state NMR structure determination using uniform labeling is limited by extensive peak overlap. We describe the characterization of a distinct structural polymorph of Abeta using solid-state NMR, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Rosetta model building. First, the overall fibril arrangement is established using mass-per-length measurements from TEM. Then, the fibril backbone arrangement, stacking registry, and "steric zipper" core interactions are determined using a number of solid-state NMR techniques on sparsely (13)C-labeled samples. Finally, we perform Rosetta structure calculations with an explicitly symmetric representation of the system. We demonstrate the power of the hybrid Rosetta/NMR approach by modeling the in-register, parallel "Iowa" mutant (D23N) at high resolution (1.2A backbone rmsd). The final models are validated using an independent set of NMR experiments that confirm key features.

25543463|t|Modulation of insulin signaling rescues BDNF transport defects independent of tau in amyloid-beta oligomer-treated hippocampal neurons.
25543463|a|Defective brain insulin signaling contributes to the cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid-beta oligomers (AbetaOs), the primary neurotoxin implicated in AD, downregulate insulin signaling by impairing protein kinase B/AKT, thereby overactivating glycogen synthase kinase-3beta. By this mechanism, AbetaOs may also impair axonal transport before tau-induced cytoskeletal collapse and cell death. Here, we demonstrate that a constitutively active form of protein kinase B/AKT prevents brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) transport defects in AbetaO-treated primary neurons from wild type (tau(+/+)) and tau knockout (tau(-/-)) mice. Remarkably, inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta rescues BDNF transport defects independent of tau. Furthermore, exendin-4, an anti-diabetes agent, restores normal BDNF axonal transport by stimulating the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor to activate the insulin pathway. Collectively, our findings indicate that normalized insulin signaling can both prevent and reverse BDNF transport defects in AbetaO-treated neurons. Ultimately, this work may reveal novel therapeutic targets that regulate BDNF trafficking, promote its secretion and uptake, and prolong neuronal survival during AD progression.

25544425|t|International note: awareness and context of cyber-harassment among secondary school students in Oyo state, Nigeria.
25544425|a|We determined the awareness and context of cyber-harassment among secondary school students (653 survey respondents and 18 in-depth interviewees) in Oyo state, Nigeria. Respondents' mean age was 14.2 +- 2.2 years and 53.9% were aware of cyber-harassment occurring in their school or among their friends. Cyber-harassment was often perpetrated via phone calls (62.5%), text messaging (36.9%), chat rooms (28.7%), through pictures or video clips sent via mobile phones (11.9%), emails (6.8%) or websites (5.9%). Cyber-harassment behaviours mentioned were the use of abusive words (25.4%), saying mean things or making fun of the victim (13.9%), solicitations for relationships (7.9%) or sex (6.8%) and spreading rumours about the victim (6.8%). In-depth interviewees recounted experiences of cyber-harassment suffered by their friends. Many were relationship-related, sexual solicitations and threats and corroborated quantitative findings. Respondents are aware of cyber-harassment occurring among students in the study area. Comprehensive interventions to address the problem need to be instituted.

25545059|t|Synthetic ceramide analogues increase amyloid-beta 42 production by modulating gamma-secretase activity.
25545059|a|gamma-Secretase cleaves amyloid beta-precursor protein (APP) to generate amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), which is a causative molecule of Alzheimer disease (AD). The C-terminal length of Abeta, which is determined by gamma-secretase activity, determines the aggregation and deposition profiles of Abeta, thereby affecting the onset of AD. In this study, we found that the synthetic ceramide analogues dl-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP) and (1S,2R-d-erythro-2-N-myristoylamino)-1-phenyl-1-propanol (DMAPP) modulated gamma-secretase-mediated cleavage to increase Abeta42 production. Unexpectedly, PDMP and DMAPP upregulated Abeta42 production independent of alteration of ceramide metabolism. Our results propose that synthetic ceramide analogues function as novel gamma-secretase modulators that increase Abeta42, and this finding might lead to the understanding of the effect of the lipid environment on gamma-secretase activity.

25546412|t|Golgi defects enhance APP amyloidogenic processing in Alzheimer's disease.
25546412|a|Increased amyloid beta (Abeta) production by sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the beta- and gamma-secretases contributes to the etiological basis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This process requires APP and the secretases to be in the same subcellular compartments, such as the endosomes. Since all membrane organelles in the endomembrane system are kinetically and functionally linked, any defects in the trafficking and sorting machinery would be expected to change the functional properties of the whole system. The Golgi is a primary organelle for protein trafficking, sorting and modifications, and Golgi defects have been reported in AD. Here we hypothesize that Golgi fragmentation in AD accelerates APP trafficking and Abeta production. Furthermore, Golgi defects may perturb the proper trafficking and processing of many essential neuronal proteins, resulting in compromised neuronal function. Therefore, molecular tools that can restore Golgi structure and function could prove useful as potential drugs for AD treatment.

25548284|t|Overexpression of heparanase lowers the amyloid burden in amyloid-beta precursor protein transgenic mice.
25548284|a|Heparan sulfate (HS) and HS proteoglycans (HSPGs) colocalize with amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposits in Alzheimer disease brain and in Abeta precursor protein (AbetaPP) transgenic mouse models. Heparanase is an endoglycosidase that specifically degrades the unbranched glycosaminoglycan side chains of HSPGs. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that HS and HSPGs are active participators of Abeta pathogenesis in vivo. We therefore generated a double-transgenic mouse model overexpressing both human heparanase and human AbetaPP harboring the Swedish mutation (tgHpa*Swe). Overexpression of heparanase did not affect AbetaPP processing because the steady-state levels of Abeta1-40, Abeta1-42, and soluble AbetaPP beta were the same in 2- to 3-month-old double-transgenic tgHpa*Swe and single-transgenic tgSwe mice. In contrast, the Congo red-positive amyloid burden was significantly lower in 15-month-old tgHpa*Swe brain than in tgSwe brain. Likewise, the Abeta burden, measured by Abetax-40 and Abetax-42 immunohistochemistry, was reduced significantly in tgHpa*Swe brain. The intensity of HS-stained plaques correlated with the Abetax-42 burden and was reduced in tgHpa*Swe mice. Moreover, the HS-like molecule heparin facilitated Abeta1-42-aggregation in an in vitro Thioflavin T assay. The findings suggest that HSPGs contribute to amyloid deposition in tgSwe mice by increasing Abeta fibril formation because heparanase-induced fragmentation of HS led to a reduced amyloid burden. Therefore, drugs interfering with Abeta-HSPG interactions might be a potential strategy for Alzheimer disease treatment.

25552579|t|Clinicians' ability to diagnose dementia with Lewy bodies is not affected by beta-amyloid load.
25552579|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether an increasing load of beta-amyloid and/or neuritic plaques influences the phenotype, and thus the clinical diagnostic accuracy, of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). METHODS: A series of 64 subjects with autopsy-proven DLB was studied. Last diagnosis before death was used to determine the clinical diagnostic accuracy of DLB in relation to Lewy body distribution and extent of Alzheimer beta-amyloid and/or neuritic pathology. DLB pathologic diagnosis was made according to consensus criteria, using alpha-synuclein immunostaining for Lewy body identification. beta-Amyloid immunostaining was used for quantifying beta-amyloid deposits. The Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease criteria and Braak stage were applied for semiquantitative grading of neuritic plaque and neurofibrillary tangle pathology. RESULTS: Overall clinical diagnostic accuracy for the entire DLB cohort was high (80%), reflecting the high prevalence of core clinical features (fluctuations [81%], parkinsonism [77%], visual hallucinations [70%]). Lower frequencies of core clinical features of DLB, resulting in lower accuracy of its clinical diagnosis, were associated with decreasing Lewy body distribution (p < 0.0001) and with increasing neuritic plaque pathology (p = 0.035), but not with the number of beta-amyloid plaque deposits. CONCLUSIONS: The likelihood of occurrence of the DLB clinical syndrome is positively related to the extent of Lewy body pathology and negatively related to the severity of Alzheimer neuritic pathology, while beta-amyloid load has no effect.

25554494|t|BDNF prevents amyloid-dependent impairment of LTP in the entorhinal cortex by attenuating p38 MAPK phosphorylation.
25554494|a|The oligomeric form of the amyloid peptide Abeta(1-42) is capable of perturbing synaptic plasticity in different brain areas. Here, we evaluated the protective role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in beta amyloid (Abeta)-dependent impairment of long-term potentiation in entorhinal cortex (EC) slices. We found that BDNF (1 ng/mL) supplied by perfusion was able to rescue long-term potentiation in Abeta(1-42)-treated slices; BDNF protection was mediated by TrkB receptor as assessed by using the tyrosine kinase inhibitor K252a (200 nM). We also investigated the function of endogenous BDNF using a soluble form of TrkB receptor (TrkB IgG). Incubation of slices with TrkB IgG (1 mug/mL) increased the EC vulnerability to Abeta. Finally, we investigated the effect of BDNF on the cell stress-kinase p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in primary cortical cell cultures exposed to Abeta(1-42). We found that Abeta induces p38 MAPK phosphorylation, although pretreatment with BDNF prevented Abeta-dependent p38 MAPK phosphorylation. This result was confirmed by an immunoassay in tissue extracts from EC slices collected after electrophysiology.

25556124|t|ER stress signaling and neurodegeneration: At the intersection between Alzheimer's disease and Prion-related disorders.
25556124|a|Alzheimer's and Prion diseases are two neurodegenerative conditions sharing different pathophysiological characteristics. Disease symptoms are associated with the abnormal accumulation of protein aggregates, which are generated by the misfolding and oligomerization of specific proteins. Recent functional studies uncovered a key role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) in the occurrence of synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration in Prion-related disorders and Alzheimer's disease. Here we review common pathological features of both diseases, emphasizing the link between amyloid formation, its pathogenesis and alterations in ER proteostasis. The potential benefits of targeting the UPR as a therapeutic strategy is also discussed.

25556162|t|Reduction of beta-amyloid and gamma-secretase by calorie restriction in female Tg2576 mice.
25556162|a|Research indicates that female risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) is greater than that of males. Moderate reduction of calorie intake, known as calorie restriction (CR), reduces pathology in AD mouse models and is a potentially translatable prevention measure for individuals at-risk for AD, as well as an important tool for understanding how the brain endogenously attenuates age-related pathology. Whether sex influences the response to CR remains unknown. In this study, we assessed the effect of CR on beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) pathology and hippocampal CA1 neuron specific gene expression in the Tg2576 mouse model of cerebral amyloidosis. Relative to ad libitum (AL) feeding, CR feeding significantly reduced hippocampal Abeta burden in 15-month-old female, but not age-matched male, Tg2576 mice. Sustained CR also significantly reduced expression of presenilin enhancer 2 (Psenen) and presenilin 1, components of the gamma-secretase complex, in Tg2576 females. These results indicate that long-term CR significantly reduces age-dependent female Tg2576 Abeta pathology, which is likely to involve CR-mediated reductions in gamma-secretase-dependent amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism.

25557164|t|A beta-hairpin-binding protein for three different disease-related amyloidogenic proteins.
25557164|a|Amyloidogenic proteins share a propensity to convert to the beta-structure-rich amyloid state that is associated with the progression of several protein-misfolding disorders. Here we show that a single engineered beta-hairpin-binding protein, the beta-wrapin AS10, binds monomers of three different amyloidogenic proteins, that is, amyloid-beta peptide, alpha-synuclein, and islet amyloid polypeptide, with sub-micromolar affinity. AS10 binding inhibits the aggregation and toxicity of all three proteins. The results demonstrate common conformational preferences and related binding sites in a subset of the amyloidogenic proteins. These commonalities enable the generation of multispecific monomer-binding agents.

25559168|t|Prognostic value of tumor necrosis at CT in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
25559168|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the prognostic value of tumor necrosis at computed tomography (CT) in newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 51 patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL who had undergone both unenhanced and intravenous contrast-enhanced CT before R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, oncovin and prednisolone) chemo-immunotherapy. Presence of tumor necrosis was visually and quantitatively assessed at CT. Associations between tumor necrosis status at CT and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) International Prognostic Index (IPI) factors were assessed. Cox regression analysis was used to determine the prognostic impact of NCCN-IPI scores and tumor necrosis status at CT. RESULTS: There were no correlations between tumor necrosis status at CT and the NCCN-IPI factors categorized age (rho=-0.042, P=0.765), categorized lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) ratio (rho=0.201, P=0.156), extranodal disease in major organs (phi=-0.245, P=0.083), Ann Arbor stage III/IV disease (phi=-0.208, P=0.141), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (phi=0.015, P=0.914). In the multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, only tumor necrosis status at CT was an independent predictive factor of progression-free survival (P=0.003) and overall survival (P=0.004). CONCLUSION: The findings of this study indicate the prognostic potential of tumor necrosis at CT in newly diagnosed DLBCL.

25569721|t|Health rights in the balance: the case against perinatal shackling of women behind bars.
25569721|a|Rationalized for decades on security grounds, perinatal shackling entails the application of handcuffs, leg irons, and/or waist shackles to the incarcerated woman prior to, during, and after labor and delivery. During labor and delivery proper, perinatal shackling may entail chaining women to the hospital bed by the ankle, wrist, or both. Medically untenable, legally challenged, and ever controversial, perinatal shackling remains the standard of practice in most US states despite sustained two-decades-long efforts by health rights legal advocates, human rights organizations, and medical professionals. Herein we review the current statutory, regulatory, legal, and medical framework undergirding the use of restraints on pregnant inmates and explore potential avenues of redress and relief to this challenge. We also recognize the courage of the women whose stories are being told. If history is any guide, the collective thrust of domestic and international law, attendant litigation, dedicated advocacy, and strength of argument bode well for continued progress toward restraint-free pregnancies in correctional settings.

25585532|t|Trajectories of memory decline in preclinical Alzheimer's disease: results from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Flagship Study of ageing.
25585532|a|Memory changes in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) are often characterized by heterogenous trajectories. However, data regarding the nature and determinants of predominant trajectories of memory changes in preclinical AD are lacking. We analyzed data from 333 cognitively healthy older adults who participated in a multicenter prospective cohort study with baseline and 18-, 36-, and 54-month follow-up assessments. Latent growth mixture modeling revealed 3 predominant trajectories of memory change: a below average, subtly declining memory trajectory (30.9%); a below average, rapidly declining memory trajectory (3.6%); and an above average, stable memory trajectory (65.5%). Compared with the stable memory trajectory, high Alphabeta (relative risk ratio [RRR] = 2.1), and lower Mini-Mental State Examination (RRR = 0.6) and full-scale IQ (RRR = 0.9) scores were independently associated with the subtly declining memory trajectory; and high Alphabeta (RRR = 8.3), APOE epsilon4 carriage (RRR = 6.1), and greater subjective memory impairment (RRR = 1.2) were independently associated with the rapidly declining memory trajectory. Compared with the subtly declining memory trajectory group, APOE epsilon4 carriage (RRR = 8.4), and subjective memory complaints (RRR = 1.2) were associated with a rapidly declining memory trajectory. These results suggest that the preclinical phase of AD may be characterized by 2 predominant trajectories of memory decline that have common (e.g., high Alphabeta) and unique (e.g., APOE epsilon4 genotype) determinants.

25590729|t|Abeta(1-42) induces abnormal alternative splicing of tau exons 2/3 in NGF-induced PC12 cells.
25590729|a|Protein tau plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, where its hyperphos-phorylation promotes aggregation and microtubule destabilization. Tau undergoes alternative splicing which generates six isoforms in the human brain, due to inclusion/exclusion of exons 2, 3 and 10. Dysregulation of the splicing process of tau exon 10 is sufficient to cause tauopathy and has shown to be influenced by beta-amyloid peptides, but splicing of other exons is less studied. We studied the effects of beta-amyloid(42) in the alternative splicing of tau exons 2/3 and 6, using untreated and Nerve Growth Factor-induced PC12 cells. Beta-amyloid exposure caused formed cell processes to retract in differentiated cells and altered the expression of exons 2/3 in both undifferentiated and differentiated cells. Expression of exon 6 was repressed in undifferentiated cells only. Our results suggest that beta-amyloid interferes with the splicing process of exons 2/3, favoring their exclusion and thus the expression of immature tau isoforms that are less efficient in stabilizing microtubules and may also be more prone to hyperphosphorylation. The molecular mechanism for this amyloid-tau interaction remains to be determined, but may have potential implications for the understanding of the underlying neuropathological processes in Alzheimer's disease.

25597800|t|Development of gold nanoparticle based colorimetric method for quantitatively studying the inhibitors of Cu(2+)/Zn(2+) induced beta-amyloid peptide assembly.
25597800|a|In this paper, a kind of gold nanoparticle (GNP)-based colorimetric assay has been developed for studying the reversible interaction of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) with Cu(2+) and Zn(2+), and quantitatively analyzing four inhibitors (i.e., EDTA, EGTA, histidine and clioquinol) of Cu(2+)/Zn(2+) induced Abeta assembly. The inhibition efficiencies (e.g., half maximal inhibitory concentration, IC50 value) of these inhibitors could be measured in this work. As far as we know, these IC50 values were reported at the first time. In this assay, the streptavidin conjugated GNPs (SA-GNPs) were employed as indicators to monitor the Cu(2+)/Zn(2+) induced aggregating/disaggregating behaviors of biotin modified beta-amyloid 1-16 peptides (Abeta1-16(biotin)). Because of high affinity of streptavidin (SA) with biotin, the aggregating/disaggregating of Abeta1-16(biotin) results in the significant color change of SA-GNPs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the assay can be used as an effective tool for designing anti-dementia drugs through quantitative analysis of the interactions of four representative inhibitors with Cu(2+)/Zn(2+) induced Abeta assembly.

25599875|t|Alzheimer's Abeta interacts with cellular prion protein inducing neuronal membrane damage and synaptotoxicity.
25599875|a|A major feature of Alzheimer's disease is the accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide in the brain. Recent studies have indicated that Abeta oligomers (Abetao) can interact with the cellular prion protein (PrPc). Therefore, this interaction might be driving some of Abeta toxic effects in the synaptic region. In the present study, we report that Abetao binds to PrPc in the neuronal membrane playing a role on toxic effects induced by Abeta. Phospholipase C-enzymatic cleavage of PrPc from the plasma membrane attenuated the association of Abetao to the neurons. Furthermore, an anti-PrP antibody (6D11) decreased the association of Abetao to hippocampal neurons with a concomitant reduction in Abetao and PrPc co-localization. Interestingly, this antibody blocked the increase in membrane conductance and intracellular calcium induced by Abetao. Thus, the data indicate that PrPc plays a role on the membrane perforations produced by Abetao, the increase in calcium ions and the release of synaptic vesicles that subsequently leads to synaptic failure. Future studies blocking Abetao interaction with PrPc could be important for the discovery of new therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease.

25599931|t|Pharmacological inhibition of BACE1 impairs synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions.
25599931|a|BACKGROUND: BACE1 (beta site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1) is the rate limiting protease in amyloid beta production, hence a promising drug target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Inhibition of BACE1, as the major beta-secretase in vivo with multiple substrates, however is likely to have mechanism-based adverse effects. We explored the impact of long-term pharmacological inhibition of BACE1 on dendritic spine dynamics, synaptic functions, and cognitive performance of adult mice. METHODS: Sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to assess Abeta40 levels in brain and plasma after oral administration of BACE1 inhibitors SCH1682496 or LY2811376. In vivo two-photon microscopy of the somatosensory cortex was performed to monitor structural dynamics of dendritic spines while synaptic functions and plasticity were measured via electrophysiological recordings of excitatory postsynaptic currents and hippocampal long-term potentiation in brain slices. Finally, behavioral tests were performed to analyze the impact of pharmacological inhibition of BACE1 on cognitive performance. RESULTS: Dose-dependent decrease of Abeta40 levels in vivo confirmed suppression of BACE1 activity by both inhibitors. Prolonged treatment caused a reduction in spine formation of layer V pyramidal neurons, which recovered after withdrawal of inhibitors. Congruently, the rate of spontaneous and miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents in pyramidal neurons and hippocampal long-term potentiation were reduced in animals treated with BACE1 inhibitors. These effects were not detected in Bace1(-/-) mice treated with SCH1682496, confirming BACE1 as the pharmacological target. Described structural and functional changes were associated with cognitive deficits as revealed in behavioral tests. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate important functions to BACE1 in structural and functional synaptic plasticity in the mature brain, with implications for cognition.

25610772|t|Basal forebrain atrophy correlates with amyloid beta burden in Alzheimer's disease.
25610772|a|The brains of patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) have three classical pathological hallmarks: amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques, tau tangles, and neurodegeneration, including that of cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain. However the relationship between Abeta burden and basal forebrain degeneration has not been extensively studied. To investigate this association, basal forebrain volumes were determined from magnetic resonance images of controls, subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and AD patients enrolled in the longitudinal Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) studies. In the AIBL cohort, these volumes were correlated within groups to neocortical gray matter retention of Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) from positron emission tomography images as a measure of Abeta load. The basal forebrain volumes of AD and aMCI subjects were significantly reduced compared to those of control subjects. Anterior basal forebrain volume was significantly correlated to neocortical PiB retention in AD subjects and aMCI subjects with high Abeta burden, whereas posterior basal forebrain volume was significantly correlated to neocortical PiB retention in control subjects with high Abeta burden. Therefore this study provides new evidence for a correlation between neocortical Abeta accumulation and basal forebrain degeneration. In addition, cluster analysis showed that subjects with a whole basal forebrain volume below a determined cut-off value had a 7 times higher risk of having a worse diagnosis within ~18 months.

25618678|t|Sensing and inhibition of amyloid-beta based on the simple luminescent aptamer-ruthenium complex system.
25618678|a|Aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide has been known to be pathologically associated with Alzheimer and dementia diseases. Amyloid-beta fibrils serve as an important target for the drugs development and diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. Herein, we report a new [Ru(dmbpy)(dcbpy)dppz)] complex (dmbpy; 4,4'-dimethyl-2,2'-bipyridine, dcbpy; 4,4'-dicorboxy-2,2'-bipyridine, dppz; dipyridophenazine) intercalated aptamer based recognition of amyloid-beta. Interestingly, aforementioned Ru(II) complex shows weak luminescence intensity in the aqueous medium but it shows strong luminescence intensity in the presence of RNA aptamer. Upon addition of amyloid-beta monomers, the luminescence intensity of Ru(II) complex is reduced due to the strong interaction of aptamer with amyloid-beta monomer/small oligomers. Furthermore, present study implies that our system has ability to inhibit the formation of amyloid-beta fibrils, which is confirmed from the AFM morphological structures in the absence and presence of aptamer. This work may contribute the rapid diagnosis and inhibition of amyloid-beta aggregation in the clinical applications.

25638532|t|Evolving brain structural changes in PSEN1 mutation carriers.
25638532|a|Familial Alzheimer's disease provides the opportunity to investigate brain changes even before the symptoms onset. We performed a structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study in 38 participants from families with presenilin 1 gene mutations: 11 symptomatic mutation carriers, 13 asymptomatic mutation carriers (AMC), with a mean of 16.22 years before the estimated appearance of symptoms, and 14 noncarriers. A subset of subjects was studied longitudinally 2 and 4 years after the first scan. We found decreased cortical thickness (CTh) and volume in cortical and subcortical structures in symptomatic mutation carriers, with progressive loss over time. In AMC, we found increased CTh and volume in temporoparietal regions and in precuneus-posterior cingulate compared with controls at baseline. Longitudinal studies in AMC, by contrast, showed accelerated rates of CTh loss in precuneus-posterior cingulate and superior parietal, right lateral temporal and left orbitofrontal, and middle frontal regions. These findings suggest that brain structure in presenilin 1 mutation carriers follows nonlinear trajectories, with regional increases during the very early presymptomatic period. Initial neuroinflammation and/or accumulation of amyloid species followed by neurodegeneration, or congenital morphometric differences, may explain the observed features.

25659857|t|Influence of genetic variants in SORL1 gene on the manifestation of Alzheimer's disease.
25659857|a|We studied the association of SORL1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms genotypes with measures of pathology in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) using an endophenotype approach. We included (1) 133 patients from the German Dementia Competence Network (71 +- 8 years; 50% females; Mini Mental State Examination [MMSE], 24 +- 3); (2) 83 patients from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (75 +- 8 years; 45% females; MMSE, 24 +- 2); and (3) 452 patients from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort 66 +- 8 years; 47% females; MMSE, 20 +- 5). As endophenotype markers we used cognitive tests, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers amyloid-beta, total tau (tau), tau phosphorylated at threonine 181, and hippocampal atrophy. We measured 19 SORL1 SNP alleles. Genotype-endophenotype associations were determined by linear regression analyses. There was an association between rs2070045-G allele and increased CSF-tau and more hippocampal atrophy. Additionally, haplotype-based analyses revealed an association between haplotype rs11218340-A/rs3824966-G/rs3824968-A and higher CSF-tau and CSF-tau phosphorylated at threonine 181. In conclusion, we found that SORL1 SNP rs2070045-G allele was related to CSF-tau and hippocampal atrophy, 2 endophenotype markers of AD, suggesting that SORL1 may be implicated in the downstream pathology in AD.

25699151|t|An Orally Available BACE1 Inhibitor That Affords Robust CNS Abeta Reduction without Cardiovascular Liabilities.
25699151|a|BACE1 inhibition to prevent Abeta peptide formation is considered to be a potential route to a disease-modifying treatment for Alzheimer's disease. Previous efforts in our laboratory using a combined structure- and property-based approach have resulted in the identification of aminooxazoline xanthenes as potent BACE1 inhibitors. Herein, we report further optimization leading to the discovery of inhibitor 15 as an orally available and highly efficacious BACE1 inhibitor that robustly reduces CSF and brain Abeta levels in both rats and nonhuman primates. In addition, compound 15 exhibited low activity on the hERG ion channel and was well tolerated in an integrated cardiovascular safety model.

25728719|t|Improving cardiovascular clinical trials conduct in the United States: recommendation from clinicians, researchers, sponsors, and regulators.
25728719|a|Advances in medical therapies leading to improved patient outcomes are in large part related to successful conduct of clinical trials that offer critical information regarding the efficacy and safety of novel interventions. The conduct of clinical trials in the United States, however, continues to face increasing challenges with recruitment and retention. These trends are paralleled by an increasing shift toward more multinational trials where most participants are enrolled in countries outside the United States, bringing into question the generalizability of the results to the American population. This manuscript presents the perspectives and recommendations from clinicians, researchers, sponsors, and regulators who attended a meeting facilitated by the Food and Drug Administration to improve upon the current clinical trial trends in the United States.

25770318|t|Antineoplastic effects of Chlorella pyrenoidosa in the breast cancer model.
25770318|a|OBJECTIVES: There has been considerable interest in both clinical and preclinical research about the role of phytochemicals in the reduction of risk for cancer in humans. The aim of this study was to determine the antineoplastic effects of Chlorella pyrenoidosa in experimental breast cancer in vivo and in vitro. METHODS: In this experiment, the antineoplastic effects of C. pyrenoidosa in the chemoprevention of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea-induced mammary carcinogenesis in female rats were evaluated. Chlorella powder was administered through diet at concentrations of 0.3% and 3%. The experiment was terminated 14 wk after carcinogen administration. At autopsy, mammary tumors were removed and prepared for histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis. In vitro cytotoxicity assay, parameters of apoptosis, and proliferation after chlorella treatment in human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) cells were carried out. RESULTS: Basic parameters of experimental carcinogenesis, mechanism of action (biomarkers of apoptosis, proliferation, and angiogenesis), chosen metabolic variables, and side effects after long-term chlorella treatment in animals were assessed. Chlorella at higher concentration suppressed tumor frequency by 61% (P < 0.02) and lengthened tumor latency by 12.5 d (P < 0.02) in comparison with the controls. Immunohistochemical analysis of rat tumor cells showed caspase-7 expression increase by 73.5% (P < 0.001) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 expression decrease by 19% (P = 0.07) after chlorella treatment. In a parallel in vitro study, chlorella significantly decreased survival of MCF-7 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In chlorella-treated MCF-7 cells, a significant increase in cells having sub-G0/G1 DNA content and significant increase of early apoptotic and late apoptotic/necrotic cells after annexin V/PI staining assay were found. Decreases in mitochondrial membrane potential and increasing reactive oxygen species generation were observed in the chlorella-treated MCF-7 cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first report on the antineoplastic effects of C. pyrenoidosa in experimental breast cancer in vivo and in vitro.

25861567|t|The Necessity of Having a Tetradentate Ligand to Extract Copper(II) Ions from Amyloids.
25861567|a|The accumulation of redox-active metal ions, in particular copper, in amyloid plaques is considered to the cause of the intensive oxidation damage to the brain of patients with Alzheimers disease (AD). Drug candidates based on a bis(8-aminoquinoline) tetradentate ligand are able to efficiently extract Cu(2+) from copper-loaded amyloids (Cu-Abeta). Contrarily, in the presence of a bidentate hydroxyquinoline, such as clioquinol, the copper is not released from Abeta, but remains sequestrated within a Abeta-Cu-clioquinol ternary complex that has been characterized by mass spectrometry. Facile extraction of copper(II) at a low amyloid/ligand ratio is essential for the re-introduction of copper in regular metal circulation in the brain. As, upon reduction, the Cu(+) is easily released from the bis(8-aminoquinoline) ligand unable to accommodate Cu(I), it should be taken by proteins with an affinity for copper. So, the tetradentate bis(8-aminoquinoline) described here might act as a regulator of copper homeostasis.

26276603|t|Amyloid Aggregation: Role of Biological Membranes and the Aggregate-Membrane System.
26276603|a|Several human degenerative diseases involve amyloidogenic peptides/proteins with high conformational plasticity and propensity to self-aggregate into polymeric fibrillar assemblies sharing the cross-beta structure and endowed with cytotoxic potential. Although the mechanisms of amyloid growth and toxicity are not fully understood, a common property of amyloids is their ability to interact with lipid bilayers disturbing membrane integrity. Lipid bilayers can also act as conformational catalysts, favoring protein misfolding and inducing the growth of aggregation nuclei, early oligomers, and mature fibrils with specific biophysical, structural, and toxicity features. This Perspective will highlight these effects in the context of a membrane-oligomer system where the conformational/biophysical features of either component affect those of the other. In this context, we will highlight the modulation of the protein-cell surface interaction by the content of membrane cholesterol and gangliosides, notably GM1. In particular, we will discuss data that indicate how these interactions affect the structural and stability properties of both protein and bilayers as well as the final cytotoxic effect. Our goal is to propose shared membrane-based mechanisms that could apply to any amyloidogenic peptide/protein, providing a biochemical background for amyloid growth and toxicity.
