27999123|t|Early Alterations of Hippocampal Neuronal Firing Induced by Abeta42.
27999123|a|We studied the effect of Amyloid beta 1-42 oligomers (Abeta42) on Ca2+ dependent excitability profile of hippocampal neurons. Abeta42 is one of the Amyloid beta peptides produced by the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein and participates in the initiating event triggering the progressive dismantling of synapses and neuronal circuits. Our experiments on cultured hippocampal network reveal that Abeta42 increases intracellular Ca2+ concentration by 46% and inhibits firing discharge by 19%. More precisely, Abeta42 differently regulates ryanodine (RyRs), NMDA receptors (NMDARs), and voltage gated calcium channels (VGCCs) by increasing Ca2+ release through RyRs and inhibiting Ca2+ influx through NMDARs and VGCCs. The overall increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration causes stimulation of K+ current carried by big conductance Ca2+ activated potassium (BK) channels and hippocampal network firing inhibition. We conclude that Abeta42 alters neuronal function by means of at least 4 main targets: RyRs, NMDARs, VGCCs, and BK channels. The development of selective modulators of these channels may in turn be useful for developing effective therapies that could enhance the quality of life of AD patients during the early onset of the pathology.

28054501|t|Modulation in the conformational and stability attributes of the Alzheimer's disease associated amyloid-beta mutants and their favorable stabilization by curcumin: molecular dynamics simulation analysis.
28054501|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides in brain. In the present study, two familial Abeta42 mutations, namely A2V (harmful) and A2T (protective) have been analyzed and compared with the wild-type (WT) by performing all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in the absence and presence of curcumin, a well-known inhibitor of Abeta plaque formation. Mutant A2V was found to exhibit highest stability followed by WT and mutant A2T in the absence of curcumin. This stability trend was found to be reversed in the presence of curcumin, suggesting a significant change in the conformational landscape of Abeta42 folding. Due to significant differences in the folding and interaction patterns of the mutants A2V and A2T, curcumin exhibited higher binding affinity for mutant A2T as compared to that of A2V. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the effect of curcumin binding on structural landscapes of the two contrasting point mutants providing an understanding of the basis of Abeta plaque formation and its prevention by curcumin.

28129943|t|Beta-Site Amyloid Precursor Protein Cleaving Enzyme 1 Inhibition Impairs Synaptic Plasticity via Seizure Protein 6.
28129943|a|BACKGROUND: Beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is a promising drug target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Prolonged BACE1 inhibition interferes with structural and functional synaptic plasticity in mice, most likely by altering the metabolism of BACE1 substrates. Seizure protein 6 (SEZ6) is predominantly cleaved by BACE1, and Sez6 knockout mice share some phenotypes with BACE1 inhibitor-treated mice. We investigated whether SEZ6 is involved in BACE1 inhibition-induced structural and functional synaptic alterations. METHODS: The function of NB-360, a novel blood-brain barrier penetrant and orally available BACE1 inhibitor, was verified by immunoblotting. In vivo microscopy was applied to monitor the impact of long-term pharmacological BACE1 inhibition on dendritic spines in the cerebral cortex of constitutive and conditional Sez6 knockout mice. Finally, synaptic functions were characterized using electrophysiological field recordings in hippocampal slices. RESULTS: BACE1 enzymatic activity was strongly suppressed by NB-360. Prolonged NB-360 treatment caused a reversible spine density reduction in wild-type mice, but it did not affect Sez6-/- mice. Knocking out Sez6 in a small subset of mature neurons also prevented the structural postsynaptic changes induced by BACE1 inhibition. Hippocampal long-term potentiation was decreased in both chronic BACE1 inhibitor-treated wild-type mice and vehicle-treated Sez6-/- mice. However, chronic NB-360 treatment did not alter long-term potentiation in CA1 neurons of Sez6-/- mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that SEZ6 plays an important role in maintaining normal dendritic spine dynamics. Furthermore, SEZ6 is involved in BACE1 inhibition-induced structural and functional synaptic alterations.

28162045|t|Scrutiny of the mechanism of small molecule inhibitor preventing conformational transition of amyloid-beta42 monomer: insights from molecular dynamics simulations.
28162045|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by loss of intellectual functioning of brain and memory loss. According to amyloid cascade hypothesis, aggregation of amyloid-beta42 (Abeta42) peptide can generate toxic oligomers and their accumulation in the brain is responsible for the onset of AD. In spite of carrying out a large number of experimental studies on inhibition of Abeta42 aggregation by small molecules, the detailed inhibitory mechanism remains elusive. In the present study, comparable molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to elucidate the inhibitory mechanism of a sulfonamide inhibitor C1 (2,5-dichloro-N-(4-piperidinophenyl)-3-thiophenesulfonamide), reported for its in vitro and in vivo anti-aggregation activity against Abeta42. MD simulations reveal that C1 stabilizes native alpha-helix conformation of Abeta42 by interacting with key residues in the central helix region (13-26) with hydrogen bonds and pi-pi interactions. C1 lowers the solvent-accessible surface area of the central hydrophobic core (CHC), KLVFF (16-20), that confirms burial of hydrophobic residues leading to the dominance of helical conformation in the CHC region. The binding free energy analysis with MM-PBSA demonstrates that Ala2, Phe4, Tyr10, Gln15, Lys16, Leu17, Val18, Phe19, Phe20, Glu22, and Met35 contribute maximum to binding free energy (-43.1 kcal/mol) between C1 and Abeta42 monomer. Overall, MD simulations reveal that C1 inhibits Abeta42 aggregation by stabilizing native helical conformation and inhibiting the formation of aggregation-prone beta-sheet conformation. The present results will shed light on the underlying inhibitory mechanism of small molecules that show potential in vitro anti-aggregation activity against Abeta42.

28168961|t|The Amyloid Precursor Protein Intracellular Domain Is an Effector Molecule of Metaplasticity.
28168961|a|BACKGROUND: Human studies and mouse models of Alzheimer's disease suggest that the amyloid precursor protein (APP) can cause changes in synaptic plasticity and is contributing to the memory deficits seen in Alzheimer's disease. While most of these studies attribute these changes to the APP cleavage product Abeta, in recent years it became apparent that the APP intracellular domain (APP-ICD) might play a role in regulating synaptic plasticity. METHODS: To separate the effects of APP-ICD on synaptic plasticity from Abeta-dependent effects, we created a chimeric APP in which the Abeta domain is exchanged for its homologous domain from the amyloid precursor-like protein 2. RESULTS: We show that the expression of this chimeric APP has no effect on basal synaptic transmission or synaptic plasticity. However, a synaptic priming protocol, which in control cells has no effect on synaptic plasticity, leads to a complete block of subsequent long-term potentiation induction and a facilitation of long-term depression induction in neurons expressing chimeric APP. We show that the underlying mechanism for this effect on metaplasticity is caused by caspase cleavage of the APP-ICD and involves activation of ryanodine receptors. Our results shed light on the controversially discussed role of APP-ICD in regulating transcription. Because of the short timespan between synaptic priming and the effect on synaptic plasticity, it is unlikely that APP-ICD-dependent transcription is an underlying mechanism for the regulation of metaplasticity during this time period. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding that the APP-ICD affects metaplasticity provides new insights into the altered regulation of synaptic plasticity during Alzheimer's disease.

28278027|t|In silico investigation on the inhibition of Abeta42 aggregation by Abeta40 peptide by potential of mean force study.
28278027|a|Recent experimental data revealed that small, soluble Amyloid beta (Abeta42) oligomers, especially dimers impair synaptic plasticity and memory leading to Alzheimer's disease. Here, we have studied dimerization of Abeta42/Abeta42 homo-dimer and Abeta40/Abeta42 hetero-dimer in terms of free energy profile by all-atom simulations using the ff99SB force field. We have found that in the presence of Abeta40 peptide, there exists a strong tendency to form a hetero-dimer with Abeta42 peptide, suggesting that a possible co-oligomerization. Furthermore, we have investigated the effects of Abeta40 on the Abeta42 peptide. Our study also shows that in presence of Abeta40, the beta-content of Abeta42 monomer is reduced. Additionally, certain residues important for bending in Abeta42 peptide attained an increased flexibility in the presence of Abeta40. The salt-bridge destabilization also manifested the impact of Abeta40 on Abeta42 peptide as a whole. Based on this, one may expect that Abeta40 inhibits the aggregation propensity of Abeta42. Moreover, the binding free energy obtained by the molecular mechanics-Poisson-Boltzmann surface area method also revealed a strong affinity between the two isoforms thereby suggests that Abeta40 binding induces conformational change in Abeta42. Our results suggest that co-oligomerization of Abeta isoforms may play a substantial role in Alzheimer's disease.

28281308|t|Overlapping but distinct TDP-43 and tau pathologic patterns in aged hippocampi.
28281308|a|Intracellular proteinaceous aggregates (inclusion bodies) are almost always detectable at autopsy in brains of elderly individuals. Inclusion bodies composed of TDP-43 and tau proteins often coexist in the same brain, and each of these pathologic biomarkers is associated independently with cognitive impairment. However, uncertainties remain about how the presence and neuroanatomical distribution of inclusion bodies correlate with underlying diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed data from the University of Kentucky AD Center autopsy series (n = 247); none of the brains had frontotemporal lobar degeneration. A specific question for this study was whether neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology outside of the Braak NFT staging scheme is characteristic of brains with TDP-43 pathology but lacking AD, that is those with cerebral age-related TDP-43 with sclerosis (CARTS). We also tested whether TDP-43 pathology is associated with comorbid AD pathology, and whether argyrophilic grains are relatively likely to be present in cases with, vs. without, TDP-43 pathology. Consistent with prior studies, hippocampal TDP-43 pathology was associated with advanced AD - Braak NFT stages V/VI. However, argyrophilic grain pathology was not more common in cases with TDP-43 pathology in this data set. In brains with CARTS (TDP-43[+]/AD[-] cases), there were more NFTs in dentate granule neurons than were seen in TDP-43[-]/AD[-] cases. These dentate granule cell NFTs could provide a proxy indicator of CARTS pathology in cases lacking substantial AD pathology. Immunofluorescent experiments in a subsample of cases found that, in both advanced AD and CARTS, approximately 1% of dentate granule neurons were PHF-1 immunopositive, whereas ~25% of TDP-43 positive cells showed colocalized PHF-1 immunoreactivity. We conclude that NFTs in hippocampal dentate granule neurons are often present in CARTS, and TDP-43 pathology may be secondary to or occurring in parallel with tauopathy.

28359566|t|Increased Plasma Beta-Secretase 1 May Predict Conversion to Alzheimer's Disease Dementia in Individuals With Mild Cognitive Impairment.
28359566|a|BACKGROUND: Increased beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) activity has consistently been detected in brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid of subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared with control subjects. The collection of cerebrospinal fluid by lumbar puncture is invasive. We sought to identify the presence of plasma BACE1 activity and determine potential alterations in subjects with MCI with clinical follow-up examinations for 3 years using patients with diagnosed probable AD dementia compared with healthy control subjects. METHODS: Seventy-five patients with probable AD, 96 individuals with MCI, and 53 age-matched and sex-matched healthy control subjects were recruited from three independent international academic memory clinics and AD research expert centers. Plasma BACE1 activity was measured by a synthetic fluorescence substrate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. BACE1 protein expression was assessed by Western blotting using three different antibodies that recognize the epitopes of the N-terminus, C-terminus, and full-length BACE1. RESULTS: Compared with healthy control subjects, plasma BACE1 activity (Vmax) significantly increased by 53.2% in subjects with MCI and by 68.9% in patients with probable AD. Subjects with MCI who converted to probable AD dementia at follow-up examinations exhibited significantly higher BACE1 activity compared with cognitively stable MCI nonconverters and showed higher levels of BACE1 activity than patients with AD. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma BACE1 activity is significantly increased in MCI converters and patients with probable AD. The sensitivities and specificities of BACE1 activity for the patients were 84% and 88%, respectively. Our results indicate that plasma BACE1 activity may be a biomarker for AD risk and could predict progression from prodromal to probable AD dementia.

28359847|t|Abeta propagation and strains: Implications for the phenotypic diversity in Alzheimer's disease.
28359847|a|The progressive nature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is thought to occur, at least in part, by the self-replication and spreading of Abeta and Tau aggregates through a prion mechanism. Evidence now exists that structural variants of Abeta prions can propagate their distinct conformations through template-directed folding of naive Abeta peptides. This notion implicates that the first self-propagating Abeta assembly to emerge in the brain dictates the conformation, anatomical spread and pace of subsequently formed deposits. It is hypothesized that a prion mechanism defines the molecular basis underlying the diverse clinicopathologic phenotypes observed across the spectrum of AD patients. Thus, distinct AD strains might require further sub-classification based on biochemical and structural characterization of aggregated Abeta. Here, we review the evidence for distinct, self-propagating Abeta strains, and discuss potential cellular mechanisms that might contribute to their manifestation. From this perspective, we also explore the implications of Abeta strains for current FDA-approved medical imaging probes and therapies for amyloid. Ultimately, the discovery of new molecular tools to differentiate Abeta strains and dissect the heterogeneity of AD may lead to the development of more informative diagnostics and strain-specific therapeutics.

28466190|t|Microglia Endocytose Amyloid beta Through the Binding of Transglutaminase 2 and Milk Fat Globule EGF Factor 8 Protein.
28466190|a|Activation of glial cells has been observed in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aggregation of amyloid beta (Abeta) is profusely observed as characteristic pathology in AD brain. In our previous study using microglial cell line BV-2, tissue-type transglutaminase (TG2) was found to be involved in phagocytosis (Kawabe et al., in Neuroimmunomodulation 22(4):243-249, 2015; Kawabe et al., Neurochem Res 2017). In the present study, we examined whether TG2 and milk fat globule EGF factor 8 protein (MFG-E8), an adaptor protein promotes macrophage to engulf apoptotic cells, were involved in Abeta endocytosis. When the neuronal/glial mixed culture was stimulated freshly prepared Abeta1-42 for 3 days, the incorporation of Abeta was observed by immunofluorescence staining technique in Iba-1-positive microglia. Cystamine, a broad competitive inhibitor of TGs, suppressed it. When aggregated Abeta was added to the mixed culture, the immunoreactivity of MFG-E8 surrounding Abeta was observed, and then followed by microglial endocytosis. Using western blotting technique, MFG-E8 was detected in cell lysate of astrocyte culture, and was also detected in the medium. When microglia culture was incubated with astrocyte conditioned medium, MFG-E8 levels in microglia tended to increase. It is likely that microglia might utilize MFG-E8 released from astrocytes as well as that expressed in themselves in order to endocytose Abeta aggregation. Furthermore, we confirmed that MFG-E8 could bind with TG2 in microglia culture by immunoprecipitate technique. These results suggest that microglia might uptake Abeta as a complex of aggregated Abeta/MFG-E8/TG2.

28509380|t|Amyloid is essential but insufficient for Alzheimer causation: addition of subcellular cofactors is required for dementia.
28509380|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine the hypotheses stating the importance of amyloid or of its oligomers in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Published studies were examined. RESULTS: The importance of amyloid in the pathogenesis of AD is well established, yet accepting it as the main cause for AD is problematic, because amyloid-centric treatments have provided no clinical benefit and about one-third of cognitively normal, older persons have cerebral amyloid plaques. Also problematic is the alternative hypothesis that, instead of amyloid plaques, it is oligomers of amyloid precursor protein that cause AD.Evidence is presented suggesting amyloid/oligomers as necessary but insufficient causes of the dementia and that, for dementia to develop, requires the addition of cofactors known to be associated with AD. Those cofactors include several subcellular processes: mitochondrial impairments; the Wnt signaling system; the unfolded protein response; the ubiquitin proteasome system; the Notch signaling system; and tau, calcium, and oxidative damage. CONCLUSIONS: A modified amyloid/oligomer hypothesis for the pathogenesis of AD is that activation of one or more of the aforementioned cofactors creates a burden of functional impairments that, in conjunction with amyloid/oligomers, now crosses a threshold of dysfunction that results in clinical dementia. Of considerable importance, several treatments that might reverse the activation of some of the subcellular processes are available, for example, lithium, pioglitazone, erythropoietin, and prazosin; they should be given in combination in a clinical trial to test their safety and efficacy.   2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

28569090|t|Insulin differentially affects the distribution kinetics of amyloid beta 40 and 42 in plasma and brain.
28569090|a|Impaired brain clearance of amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) 40 and 42 across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is believed to be one of the pathways responsible for Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Hyperinsulinemia prevalent in type II diabetes was shown to damage cerebral vasculature and increase Abeta accumulation in AD brain. However, there is no clarity on how aberrations in peripheral insulin levels affect Abeta accumulation in the brain. This study describes, for the first time, an intricate relation between plasma insulin and Abeta transport at the BBB. Upon peripheral insulin administration in wild-type mice: the plasma clearance of Abeta40 increased, but Abeta42 clearance reduced; the plasma-to-brain influx of Abeta40 increased, and that of Abeta42 reduced; and the clearance of intracerebrally injected Abeta40 decreased, whereas Abeta42 clearance increased. In hCMEC/D3 monolayers (in vitro BBB model) exposed to insulin, the luminal uptake and luminal-to-abluminal permeability of Abeta40 increased and that of Abeta42 reduced; the abluminal-to-luminal permeability of Abeta40 decreased, whereas Abeta42 permeability increased. Moreover, Abeta cellular trafficking machinery was altered. In summary, Abeta40 and Abeta42 demonstrated distinct distribution kinetics in plasma and brain compartments, and insulin differentially modulated their distribution. Cerebrovascular disease and metabolic disorders may disrupt this intricate homeostasis and aggravate AD pathology.

28571516|t|NSAIDs as potential treatment option for preventing amyloid beta toxicity in Alzheimer's disease: an investigation by docking, molecular dynamics, and DFT studies.
28571516|a|Aggregation of amyloid beta (Abeta) protein considered as one of contributors in development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Several investigations have identified the importance of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as Abeta aggregation inhibitors. Here, we have examined the binding interactions of 24 NSAIDs belonging to eight different classes, with Abeta fibrils by exploiting docking and molecular dynamics studies. Minimum energy conformation of the docked NSAIDs were further optimized by density functional theory (DFT) employing Becke's three-parameter hybrid model, Lee-Yang-Parr (B3LYP) correlation functional method. DFT-based global reactivity descriptors, such as electron affinity, hardness, softness, chemical potential, electronegativity, and electrophilicity index were calculated to inspect the expediency of these descriptors for understanding the reactive nature and sites of the molecules. Few selected NSAID-Abeta fibrils complexes were subjected to molecular dynamics simulation to illustrate the stability of these complexes and the most prominent interactions during the simulated trajectory. All of the NSAIDs exhibited potential activity against Abeta fibrils in terms of predicted binding affinity. Sulindac was found to be the most active compound underscoring the contribution of indene methylene substitution, whereas acetaminophen was observed as least active NSAID. General structural requirements for interaction of NSAIDs with Abeta fibril include: aryl/heteroaryl aromatic moiety connected through a linker of 1-2 atoms to a distal aromatic group. Considering these structural requirements and electronic features, new potent agents can be designed and developed as potential Abeta fibril inhibitors for the treatment of AD.

28587718|t|beta-Amyloid Precursor Protein Intracellular Domain Controls Mitochondrial Function by Modulating Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog-Induced Kinase 1 Transcription in Cells and in Alzheimer Mice Models.
28587718|a|BACKGROUND: Mitophagy and mitochondrial dynamics alterations are two major hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases. Dysfunctional mitochondria accumulate in Alzheimer's disease-affected brains by yet unexplained mechanisms. METHODS: We combined cell biology, molecular biology, and pharmacological approaches to unravel a novel molecular pathway by which presenilins control phosphatase and tensin homolog-induced kinase 1 (Pink-1) expression and transcription. In vivo approaches were carried out on various transgenic and knockout animals as well as in adeno-associated virus-infected mice. Functional readout and mitochondrial physiology (mitochondrial potential) were assessed by combined procedures including flow cytometry, live imaging analysis, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: We show that presenilins 1 and 2 trigger opposite effects on promoter transactivation, messenger RNA, and protein expression of Pink-1. This control is linked to gamma-secretase activity and beta-amyloid precursor protein but is independent of phosphatase and tensin homolog. We show that amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain (AICD) accounts for presenilin-dependent phenotype and upregulates Pink-1 transactivation in cells as well as in vivo in a Forkhead box O3a-dependent manner. Interestingly, the modulation of gamma-secretase activity or AICD expression affects Pink-1-related control of mitophagy and mitochondrial dynamics. Finally, we show that parkin acts upstream of presenilins to control Pink-1 promoter transactivation and protein expression. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we delineate a molecular cascade presenilins-AICD-Forkhead box O3a linking parkin to Pink-1. Our study demonstrates AICD-mediated Pink-1-dependent control of mitochondrial physiology by presenilins. Furthermore, it unravels a parkin-Pink-1 feedback loop controlling mitochondrial physiology that could be disrupted in neurodegenerative conditions.

28633568|t|The potential inhibitory effect of beta-casein on the aggregation and deposition of Abeta1-42 fibrils in Alzheimer's disease: insight from in-vitro and in-silico studies.
28633568|a|Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 have been shown to be the main components of the amyloid plaques found in the extracellular environment of neurons in Alzheimer's disease. beta-Casein, a milk protein, has been shown to display a remarkable chaperone ability in preventing the aggregation of proteins. In this study, the ability of beta-casein to suppress the amyloid fibril formation of Abeta1-42 has been examined through in vitro studies and molecular docking simulation. The results demonstrate the inhibitory effect of beta-casein on fibril formation in Abeta1-42, in a concentration dependent manner, suggesting that the chaperone binds to the Abeta1-42 and prevents amyloid fibril formation. Molecular docking results show that the inhibitory effect of the beta-casein may be due to binding of the chaperone with the aggregation-prone region of the Abeta1-42 mainly via hydrophobic interactions. beta-Casein probably binds to the CHC and C-terminal domain of the Abeta1-42, and stabilizes proteins by inhibiting the conversion of monomeric Abeta1-42 into fibrils. Thus our data suggests that the hydrophobic interactions between beta-casein and Abeta1-42 play an important role in the burial of the hydrophobic part of the Abeta1-42. This means that beta-casein maybe considered for use in preventing amyloid fibril formation in degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer.

28655157|t|Neuroinflammation and Tau Interact with Amyloid in Predicting Sleep Problems in Aging Independently of Atrophy.
28655157|a|Sleep problems relate to brain changes in aging and disease, but the mechanisms are unknown. Studies suggest a relationship between beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation and sleep, which is likely augmented by interactions with multiple variables. Here, we tested how different cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for brain pathophysiology, brain atrophy, memory function, and depressive symptoms predicted self-reported sleep patterns in 91 cognitively healthy older adults over a 3-year period. The results showed that CSF levels of total- and phosphorylated (P) tau, and YKL-40-a marker of neuroinflammation/astroglial activation-predicted poor sleep in Abeta positive older adults. Interestingly, although brain atrophy was strongly predictive of poor sleep, the relationships between CSF biomarkers and sleep were completely independent of atrophy. A joint analysis showed that unique variance in sleep was explained by P-tau and the P-tau x Abeta interaction, memory function, depressive symptoms, and brain atrophy. The results demonstrate that sleep relates to a range of different pathophysiological processes, underscoring the importance of understanding its impact on neurocognitive changes in aging and people with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease.

28696433|t|Elevated plasma ferritin in elderly individuals with high neocortical amyloid-beta load.
28696433|a|Ferritin, an iron storage and regulation protein, has been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, it has not been investigated in preclinical AD, detected by neocortical amyloid-beta load (NAL), before cognitive impairment. Cross-sectional analyses were carried out for plasma and serum ferritin in participants in the Kerr Anglican Retirement Village Initiative in Aging Health cohort. Subjects were aged 65-90 years and were categorized into high and low NAL groups via positron emission tomography using a standard uptake value ratio cutoff=1.35. Ferritin was significantly elevated in participants with high NAL compared with those with low NAL, adjusted for covariates age, sex, apolipoprotein E e4 carriage and levels of C-reactive protein (an inflammation marker). Ferritin was also observed to correlate positively with NAL. A receiver operating characteristic curve based on a logistic regression of the same covariates, the base model, distinguished high from low NAL (area under the curve (AUC)=0.766), but was outperformed when plasma ferritin was added to the base model (AUC=0.810), such that at 75% sensitivity, the specificity increased from 62 to 71% on adding ferritin to the base model, indicating that ferritin is a statistically significant additional predictor of NAL over and above the base model. However, ferritin's contribution alone is relatively minor compared with the base model. The current findings suggest that impaired iron mobilization is an early event in AD pathogenesis. Observations from the present study highlight ferritin's potential to contribute to a blood biomarker panel for preclinical AD.

28699113|t|Protective Role Of Naringenin Against Abeta25-35-Caused Damage via ER and PI3K/Akt-Mediated Pathways.
28699113|a|Senile plaque accumulation and neurofibrillary tangles are primary characteristics of Alzheimer's disease. We aimed to assess the protective functions of naringenin against beta-amyloid protein fragment 25-35 (Abeta25-35)-caused nerve damage in differentiated PC12 cells, and study the potential mechanisms. We evaluated cell viability and apoptosis using the 3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) test and flow cytometry, respectively. Moreover, we measured protein kinase B (Akt), glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), and caspase-3 activity via western blotting and RT-PCR. We found that naringenin protected cell against Abeta25-35-caused nerve damage by increasing cell viability, promoting Akt and GSK3beta activation, and inhibiting cell apoptosis and caspase-3 activity. However, treatment with the estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist ICI182, 780 or phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 suppressed the effects of naringenin. Our results suggested that naringenin could effectively suppress Abeta25-35-caused nerve damage in PC12 cells by regulating the ER and PI3K/Akt pathways.

28703923|t|Autophagy in neurodegenerative diseases: pathogenesis and therapy.
28703923|a|The most prevalent pathological features of many neurodegenerative diseases are the aggregation of misfolded proteins and the loss of certain neuronal populations. Autophagy, as major intracellular machinery for degrading aggregated proteins and damaged organelles, has been reported to be involved in the occurrence of pathological changes in many neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In this review, we summarize most recent research progress in this topic and provide a new perspective regarding autophagy regulation on the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, we discuss the signaling molecules in autophagy-related pathways as therapeutic targets for the treatment of these diseases.

28710906|t|Upward drift in cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta 42 assay values for more than 10 years.
28710906|a|INTRODUCTION: The best-established cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease are levels of amyloid beta 42 (Abeta42), total tau (tau), and phosphorylated tau 181 (ptau). We examined whether a widely used commercial immunoassay for CSF Abeta42, tau, and ptau provided stable measurements for more than ~10 years. METHODS: INNOTEST assay values for CSF Abeta42, tau, and ptau from Washington University in St. Louis and VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, were evaluated. RESULTS: Abeta42 values as measured by the INNOTEST assay drifted upward by approximately 3% per year over the past decade. Tau values remained relatively stable, whereas results for ptau were mixed. DISCUSSION: Assay drift may reduce statistical power or even confound analyses. The drift in INNOTEST Abeta42 values may reduce diagnostic accuracy for Alzheimer's disease in the clinic. We recommend methods to account for assay drift in existing data sets and to reduce assay drift in future studies.

28711595|t|Abeta truncated species: Implications for brain clearance mechanisms and amyloid plaque deposition.
28711595|a|Extensive parenchymal and vascular Abeta deposits are pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Besides classic full-length peptides, biochemical analyses of brain deposits have revealed high degree of Abeta heterogeneity likely resulting from the action of multiple proteolytic enzymes. In spite of the numerous studies focusing in Abeta, the relevance of N- and C-terminal truncated species for AD pathogenesis remains largely understudied. In the present work, using novel antibodies specifically recognizing Abeta species N-terminally truncated at position 4 or C-terminally truncated at position 34, we provide a clear assessment of the differential topographic localization of these species in AD brains and transgenic models. Based on their distinct solubility, brain N- and C-terminal truncated species were extracted by differential fractionation and identified via immunoprecipitation coupled to mass spectrometry analysis. Biochemical/biophysical studies with synthetic homologues further confirmed the different solubility properties and contrasting fibrillogenic characteristics of the truncated species composing the brain Abeta peptidome. Abeta C-terminal degradation leads to the production of more soluble fragments likely to be more easily eliminated from the brain. On the contrary, N-terminal truncation at position 4 favors the formation of poorly soluble, aggregation prone peptides with high amyloidogenic propensity and the potential to exacerbate the fibrillar deposits, self-perpetuating the amyloidogenic loop. Detailed assessment of the molecular diversity of Abeta species composing interstitial fluid and amyloid deposits at different disease stages, as well as the evaluation of the truncation profile during various pharmacologic approaches will provide a comprehensive understanding of the still undefined contribution of Abeta truncations to the disease pathogenesis and their potential as novel therapeutic targets.

28755839|t|Peripheral complement interactions with amyloid beta peptide in Alzheimer's disease: 2. Relationship to amyloid beta immunotherapy.
28755839|a|INTRODUCTION: Our previous studies have shown that amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) is subject to complement-mediated clearance from the peripheral circulation, and that this mechanism is deficient in Alzheimer's disease. The mechanism should be enhanced by Abeta antibodies that form immune complexes (ICs) with Abeta, and therefore may be relevant to current Abeta immunotherapy approaches. METHODS: Multidisciplinary methods were employed to demonstrate enhanced complement-mediated capture of Abeta antibody immune complexes compared with Abeta alone in both erythrocytes and THP1-derived macrophages. RESULTS: Abeta antibodies dramatically increased complement activation and opsonization of Abeta, followed by commensurately enhanced Abeta capture by human erythrocytes and macrophages. These in vitro findings were consistent with enhanced peripheral clearance of intravenously administered Abeta antibody immune complexes in nonhuman primates. DISCUSSION: Together with our previous results, showing significant Alzheimer's disease deficits in peripheral Abeta clearance, the present findings strongly suggest that peripheral mechanisms should not be ignored as contributors to the effects of Abeta immunotherapy.

28774656|t|Plasma apolipoprotein E levels and risk of dementia: A Mendelian randomization study of 106,562 individuals.
28774656|a|INTRODUCTION: In recent prospective studies, low plasma levels of apolipoprotein E (apoE) are associated with high risk of dementia. Whether this reflects a causal association remains to be established. METHODS: Using a Mendelian randomization approach, we studied 106,562 and 75,260 individuals from the general population in observational and genetic analyses, respectively. RESULTS: In observational analyses risk of Alzheimer's disease and all dementia increased stepwise as a function of stepwise lower apoE levels (P for trend, 2 x 10-17 and 9 x 10-21). APOE-weighted allele scores were associated with stepwise decreases in apoE (P for trend, <1 x 10-300). In instrumental variable analysis, the causal risk ratios for a 1 mg/dL genetically determined lower apoE were 1.41 (1.27-1.57) for Alzheimer's disease and 1.33 (1.25-1.43) for all dementia (F-statistics = 3821). DISCUSSION: Genetic and hence lifelong low apoE is associated with high risk of dementia in the general population. The concordance between observational and genetic estimates suggests a potential causal relationship.

28799085|t|Dimerization leads to changes in APP (amyloid precursor protein) trafficking mediated by LRP1 and SorLA.
28799085|a|Proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by alpha-, beta- and gamma-secretases is a determining factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Imbalances in the activity of all three enzymes can result in alterations towards pathogenic Abeta production. Proteolysis of APP is strongly linked to its subcellular localization as the secretases involved are distributed in different cellular compartments. APP has been shown to dimerize in cis-orientation, affecting Abeta production. This might be explained by different substrate properties defined by the APP oligomerization state or alternatively by altered APP monomer/dimer localization. We investigated the latter hypothesis using two different APP dimerization systems in HeLa cells. Dimerization caused a decreased localization of APP to the Golgi and at the plasma membrane, whereas the levels in the ER and in endosomes were increased. Furthermore, we observed via live cell imaging and biochemical analyses that APP dimerization affects its interaction with LRP1 and SorLA, suggesting that APP dimerization modulates its interplay with sorting molecules and in turn its localization and processing. Thus, pharmacological approaches targeting APP oligomerization properties might open novel strategies for treatment of AD.

28801921|t|Autophagy impairment by caspase-1-dependent inflammation mediates memory loss in response to beta-Amyloid peptide accumulation.
28801921|a|beta-Amyloid peptide accumulation in the cortex and in the hippocampus results in neurodegeneration and memory loss. Recently, it became evident that the inflammatory response triggered by beta-Amyloid peptides promotes neuronal cell death and degeneration. In addition to inflammation, beta-Amyloid peptides also induce alterations in neuronal autophagy, eventually leading to neuronal cell death. Thus, here we evaluated whether the inflammatory response induced by the beta-Amyloid peptides impairs memory via disrupting the autophagic flux. We show that male mice overexpressing beta-Amyloid peptides (5XFAD) but lacking caspase-1, presented reduced beta-Amyloid plaques in the cortex and in the hippocampus; restored brain autophagic flux and improved learning and memory capacity. At the molecular level, inhibition of the inflammatory response in the 5XFAD mice restored LC3-II levels and prevented the accumulation of oligomeric p62 and ubiquitylated proteins. Furthermore, caspase-1 deficiency reinstates activation of the AMPK/Raptor pathway while down-regulating AKT/mTOR pathway. Consistent with this, we found an inverse correlation between the increase of autophagolysosomes in the cortex of 5XFAD mice lacking caspase-1 and the presence of mitochondria with altered morphology. Together our results indicate that beta-Amyloid peptide-induced caspase-1 activation, disrupts autophagy in the cortex and in the hippocampus resulting in neurodegeneration and memory loss.

28816110|t|Reduced beta-amyloid sensitivity for platelet-monocyte aggregates in EDTA blood of alzheimer patients.
28816110|a|Alzheimer s disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative brain disorder characterized by beta-amyloid plaques, Tau pathology, inflammation, neurodegeneration, and cerebrovascular dysfunction. Besides that, alterations in monocytes and platelets have been reported in the blood of Alzheimer patients. In the present study, we measured circulating levels of platelet-monocyte aggregates in EDTA blood of cognitively healthy participants and 40 AD patients, and examined their changes induced by stimulation with beta-amyloid peptides. We measured CD14, CD62P, and CD42a using fluorescence-activated cell scanning (FACS) analysis. Our data show that the levels of circulating monocyte-platelet aggregates were not different between healthy controls and AD patients. However, incubation with beta-amyloid-40, -42, and pyroglutamate-beta-amyloid increased the platelet-monocyte aggregation in healthy subjects, but not AD patients. Our data conclude that the interaction between monocytes and platelets is not altered in whole blood of AD patients, but their sensitivity toward beta-amyloid peptides is decreased. There might be a critical link between the interaction of platelets and monocytes in AD, which has to be explored in further studies.

28833898|t|Hippocampal sclerosis, hippocampal neuron loss patterns and TDP-43 in the aged population.
28833898|a|Hippocampal neuron loss is a common neuropathological feature in old age with various underlying etiologies. Hippocampal sclerosis of aging (HS-Aging) is neuropathologically characterized by severe CA1 neuronal loss and frequent presence of transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) aggregations. Its etiology is unclear and currently no standardized approaches to measure HS-Aging exist. We developed a semi-quantitative protocol, which captures various hippocampal neuron loss patterns, and compared their occurrence in the context of HS-Aging, TDP-43, vascular and tau pathology in 672 brains (TDP-43 staining n = 642/672, 96%) donated for the population-based Cambridge City over-75s Cohort and the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study. HS-Aging was first evaluated independently from the protocol using the most common criteria defined in literature, and then described in detail through examination of neuron loss patterns and associated pathologies. 34 (5%) cases were identified, with a maximum of five pyramidal neurons in each of over half CA1 fields-of-view (x200 magnification), no vascular damage, no neuron loss in CA2-CA4, but consistent TDP-43 neuronal solid inclusions and neurites. We also report focal CA1 neuron loss with vascular pathology to affect predominantly CA1 bordering CA2 (Fisher's exact, P = 0.009), whereas neuron loss in the subicular end of CA1 was associated with TDP-43 inclusions (Fisher's exact, P < 0.001) and high Braak stage (Fisher's exact, P = 0.001). Hippocampal neuron loss in CA4-CA2 was not associated with TDP-43. We conclude that hippocampal neuron loss patterns are associated with different etiologies within CA1, and propose that these patterns can be used to form objective criteria for HS-Aging diagnosis. Finally, based on our results we hypothesize that neuron loss leading to HS-Aging starts from the subicular end of CA1 when it is associated with TDP-43 pathology, and that this neurodegenerative process is likely to be significantly more common than "end-stage" HS-Aging only.

28855140|t|Prenatal stress induced gender-specific alterations of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunit expression and response to Abeta in offspring hippocampal cells.
28855140|a|Prenatal stress (PS) is one of adverse life events during pregnancy, which may increase vulnerability to cognitive impairment in adult offspring. Abeta synaptotoxicity is one important pathological factor for cognitive impairment, and PS-induced cognitive disorder is closely associated with N-Methyl-d-Aspartate receptor (NMDAR), which acts as a key mediator of Abeta synaptotoxicity. In the present study, we tried to explore whether PS affects offspring's Abeta levels and NMDAR subunit expression in a gender-specific manner in hippocampal CA and DG subregions, and whether PS affects synaptic proteins and NMDAR subunit expression in cultured offspring hippocampal cells exposed to Abeta. Pregnant SD rats with restraint stress from gestation day 8-20 were used as PS model. Morris water maze, ELISA, immunofluorescence and western blot were tested on postnatal day 90 in male and female PS offspring. Our results showed that female offspring is more vulnerable to PS-induced cognitive impairment. Surprisingly, PS enhanced Abeta1-40 levels in the hippocampal DG subregion of male offspring. Furthermore, WB results implied that the decreased GluN2A in CA of female may contribute to the PS-induced cognitive impairment, while in DG, the increased GluN2A and decreased GluN2B contributed to protective effects against Abeta. Interestingly, we found PS could alleviate Abeta synaptotoxicity in male offspring's hippocampal cells. Overall, our results provided a fundamental understanding of PS-induced gender-specific alterations of NMDAR subunit expression and the susceptibility to Abeta, and paved the road for the development of timely preventive interventions on cognitive disorders of PS offspring.

28863894|t|Characterization of a pectin from Lonicera japonica Thunb. and its inhibition effect on Abeta42 aggregation and promotion of neuritogenesis.
28863894|a|Pectin is a class of complex polysaccharides and recognized for its potential bioactivities. In this study, we showed that a pectic polysaccharide, LFA03-a, was extracted from Lonicera japonica Thunb. flowers and purified with DEAE-cellulose and Sephacryl S-100HR. LFA03-a was composed of rhamnose, arabinose, galactose and galacturonic acid in the molar ratio of 18.1:25.3:36.8:19.5. Its structure was determined to possess a rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I) backbone consisting of alpha-l-1,2-Rhap and alpha-d-1,4-GalAp disaccharide repeating unit, substituted at O-4 of l-rhamnose. The side chain was involved with beta-d-1,4-Galp, beta-d-1,3-Galp, beta-d-1,3,6-Galp and branched alpha-l-1,5-Araf. Fluorescence spectroscopic analysis with thioflavine T (ThT) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) results showed that LFA03-a inhibited Abeta42 aggregation in a dose dependent manner and impeded Abeta42 oligomerization and fibril formation. In addition, LFA03-a mildly induced the differentiation of PC12 cells and promoted neuritogenesis.The results suggested that pectin LFA03-a might be a potential targeted therapeutic drug for Alzheimer's disease.

28918941|t|Modulation of gamma- and beta-Secretases as Early Prevention Against Alzheimer's Disease.
28918941|a|The genetic evidence implicating amyloid-beta in the initial stage of Alzheimer's disease is unequivocal. However, the long biochemical and cellular prodromal phases of the disease suggest that dementia is the result of a series of molecular and cellular cascades whose nature and connections remain unknown. Therefore, it is unlikely that treatments directed at amyloid-beta will have major clinical effects in the later stages of the disease. We discuss the two major candidate therapeutic targets to lower amyloid-beta in a preventive mode, i.e., gamma- and beta-secretase; the rationale behind these two targets; and the current state of the field.

28938337|t|Pulse pressure is associated with plasma amyloid-beta transport dysfunction.
28938337|a|OBJECTIVE: Increased pulse pressure (PP) has been implicated in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease in middle-aged and elderly adults. Considering the close relationship between peripheral amyloid-beta clearance and brain amyloid-beta deposition, we investigated the potential association between PP and plasma amyloid-beta transport function. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a total of 1118 participants underwent a health assessment and quantification of plasma amyloid-beta and amyloid-beta transporter expression. Relationships between plasma levels of amyloid-beta1-40, amyloid-beta1-42, soluble low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (sLRP1), soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE), and PP were determined using multiple linear regressions. RESULTS: PP was a significant determinant of amyloid-beta1-40 level (beta = 0.059, P = 0.036) and log-transformed sRAGE (beta = -0.002, P = 0.029) independent of age, sex, body mass index, pulse rate, mean arterial pressure, blood glucose, blood lipids, lifestyle, and medical history. Additionally, log-transformed soluble low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 and log-transformed sRAGE were positively associated with plasma amyloid-beta1-40 level (beta = 3.610, P < 0.001; beta = 2.573, P = 0.001). Similar associations were observed between log-transformed sRAGE and plasma amyloid-beta1-42 level (beta = 1.350, P = 0.022). CONCLUSION: An elevation in PP is associated with increased plasma amyloid-beta1-40 and decreased log-transformed sRAGE among individuals not taking antihypertensive medication. The underlying mechanism of this effect may be relevant to peripheral amyloid-beta clearance.

28939187|t|The ameliorative effects and underlying mechanisms of dopamine D1-like receptor agonist SKF38393 on Abeta1-42-induced cognitive impairment.
28939187|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized by extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. It is the most common form of human cognitive decline and dementia. In this study, we aim to systematically investigate the ameliorative effects of dopamine D1-like receptor agonist SKF38393 on cognitive dysfunction and explore its underlying mechanisms. The Abeta1-42 was injected intracerebroventricularly to establish cognitive disorder model. Then, a series of behavior tests were used. In order to further study the mechanisms, some relevant protein was assessed by ELISA method and Western blot. The results in behavior tests revealed that SKF38393 significantly ameliorated all the test indexes compared with the model mice. Then SKF38393 increased phosphorylation of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and expression of Bcl-2 in Western blot analyses. Furthermore, in ELISA assay, SKF38393 significantly increased the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels and reduced the beta-site APP cleaving enzyme1 (BACE1) and Abeta1-42 levels in hippocampus and cortex of mice. However, compared with SKF38393-H, all these results were significantly reversed by the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390. These results indicated that SKF38393 could ameliorate Abeta1-42-induced cognitive dysfunction in mice, which may be related to D1 receptor activation. It leads to the phosphorylation of CREB, which promote the expression of BDNF, Bcl-2 and decrease the expression of Abeta1-42 of mice. Our findings suggest that dopamine D1-like receptor may be a potential target for the treatment of AD and its agonists may become a novel drug in the future.

28939683|t|Evidence that iron accelerates Alzheimer's pathology: a CSF biomarker study.
28939683|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ferritin (reporting brain iron) is associated with longitudinal changes in CSF beta-amyloid (Abeta) and tau. METHODS: Mixed-effects models of CSF Abeta1-42 and tau were constructed using data from 296 participants who had baseline measurement of CSF ferritin and annual measurement of CSF tau and Abeta1-42 for up to 5 years. RESULTS: In subjects with biomarker-confirmed Alzheimer's pathology, high CSF ferritin (>6.2 ng/mL) was associated with accelerated depreciation of CSF Abeta1-42 (reporting increased plaque formation; p=0.0001). CSF ferritin was neither associated with changes in CSF tau in the same subjects, nor longitudinal changes in CSF tau or Abeta1-42 in subjects with low baseline pathology. In simulation modelling of the natural history of Abeta deposition, which we estimated to occur over 31.4 years, we predicted that it would take 12.6 years to reach the pathology threshold value of CSF Abeta from healthy normal levels, and this interval is not affected by CSF ferritin. CSF ferritin influences the fall in CSF Abeta over the next phase, where high CSF ferritin accelerated the transition from threshold preclinical Abeta levels to the average level of Alzheimer's subjects from 18.8 to 10.8 years. CONCLUSIONS: Iron might facilitate Abeta deposition in Alzheimer's and accelerate the disease process.

28943286|t|Polygenic risk score of sporadic late-onset Alzheimer's disease reveals a shared architecture with the familial and early-onset forms.
28943286|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the extent of overlap of the genetic architecture among the sporadic late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (sLOAD), familial late-onset AD (fLOAD), sporadic early-onset AD (sEOAD), and autosomal dominant early-onset AD (eADAD). METHODS: Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) were constructed using previously identified 21 genome-wide significant loci for LOAD risk. RESULTS: We found that there is an overlap in the genetic architecture among sEOAD, fLOAD, and sLOAD. The highest association of the PRS and risk (odds ratio [OR] = 2.27; P = 1.29 x 10-7) was observed in sEOAD, followed by fLOAD (OR = 1.75; P = 1.12 x 10-7) and sLOAD (OR = 1.40; P = 1.21 x 10-3). The PRS was associated with cerebrospinal fluid ptau181-Abeta42 on eADAD (P = 4.36 x 10-2). CONCLUSION: Our analysis confirms that the genetic factors identified for LOAD modulate risk in sLOAD and fLOAD and also sEOAD cohorts. Specifically, our results suggest that the burden of these risk variants is associated with familial clustering and earlier onset of AD. Although these variants are not associated with risk in the eADAD, they may be modulating age at onset.

28947378|t|Valproic acid and its congener propylisopropylacetic acid reduced the amount of soluble amyloid-beta oligomers released from 7PA2 cells.
28947378|a|The amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease suggests that synaptic degeneration and pathology is caused by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Subsequently, soluble Abeta oligomers cause the loss of synaptic proteins from neurons, a histopathological feature of Alzheimer's disease that correlates with the degree of dementia. In this study, the production of toxic forms of Abeta was examined in vitro using 7PA2 cells stably transfected with human APP. We show that conditioned media from 7PA2 cells containing Abeta oligomers caused synapse degeneration as measured by the loss of synaptic proteins, including synaptophysin and cysteine-string protein, from cultured neurons. Critically, conditioned media from 7PA2 cells treated with valproic acid (2-propylpentanoic acid (VPA)) or propylisopropylacetic acid (PIA) did not cause synapse damage. Treatment with VPA or PIA did not significantly affect total Abeta42 concentrations; rather these drugs selectively reduced the concentrations of Abeta42 oligomers in conditioned media. In contrast, treatment significantly increased the concentrations of Abeta42 monomers in conditioned media. VPA or PIA treatment reduced the concentrations of APP within lipid rafts, membrane compartments associated with Abeta production. These effects of VPA and PIA were reversed by the addition of platelet-activating factor, a bioactive phospholipid produced following activation of phospholipase A2, an enzyme sensitive to VPA and PIA. Collectively these data suggest that VPA and PIA reduce Abeta oligomers through inhibition of phospholipase A2 and suggest a novel therapeutic approach to Alzheimer's treatment.

28956268|t|Modulation of Alzheimer's amyloid beta peptide oligomerization and toxicity by extracellular Hsp70.
28956268|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder leading to dementia caused by advanced neuronal dysfunction and death. The most significant symptoms of AD are observed at late stages of the disease when interventions are most likely too late to ameliorate the condition. Currently, the predominant theory for AD is the "amyloid hypothesis," which states that abnormally increased levels of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides result in the production of a variety of aggregates that are neurotoxic. The specific mechanisms for Abeta peptide-induced cytotoxicity have not yet been completely elucidated. However, since the majority of Abeta is released into the extracellular milieu, it is reasonable to assume that toxicity begins outside the cells and makes its way inside where it disrupts the basic cellular process resulting in cell death. There is increasing evidence that hsp, particularly Hsp70, are exported into the extracellular milieu by an active export mechanism independent of cell death. Therefore, both Abeta peptides and Hsp70 may coexist in a common environment during pathological conditions. We observed that Hsp70 affected the Abeta assembling process in vitro preventing oligomer formation. Moreover, the presence of Hsp70 reduced the Abeta peptide-induced toxicity of cultured neurons (N2A cells). These results suggest a potential mechanism for the reduction of the detrimental effects of Abeta peptides in AD.

28959912|t|Endothelium-specific amyloid precursor protein deficiency causes endothelial dysfunction in cerebral arteries.
28959912|a|The exact physiological function of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) in endothelial cells is unknown. Endothelium-specific APP-deficient (eAPP-/-) mice were created to gain new insights into the role of APP in the control of vascular endothelial function. Endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine were significantly impaired in basilar arteries of global APP knockout (APP-/-) and eAPP-/- mice ( P < 0.05). In contrast, endothelium-independent relaxations to nitric oxide (NO)-donor diethylamine-NONOate were unchanged. Western blot analysis revealed that protein expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) was significantly downregulated in large cerebral arteries of APP-/- mice and eAPP-/- mice as compared to respective wild-type littermates ( P < 0.05). Furthermore, basal levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) were also significantly reduced in large cerebral arteries of APP-deficient mice ( P < 0.05). In contrast, protein expression of prostacyclin synthase as well as levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) was not affected by genetic inactivation of APP in endothelial cells. By using siRNA to knockdown APP in cultured human brain microvascular endothelial cells we also found a significant downregulation of eNOS mRNA and protein expressions in APP-deficient endothelium ( P < 0.05). These findings indicate that under physiological conditions, expression of APP in cerebral vascular endothelium plays an important protective function by maintaining constitutive expression of eNOS .

28967385|t|Anti-Amyloid-beta Monoclonal Antibodies for Alzheimer's Disease: Pitfalls and Promise.
28967385|a|The majority of putative disease-modifying treatments in development for Alzheimer's disease are directed against the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide. Among the anti-Abeta therapeutic approaches, the most extensively developed is immunotherapy-specifically, passive immunization through administration of exogenous monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Although testing of mAbs has been fraught with failure and confusing results, the experience gained from these trials has provided important clues for better treatments. This review summarizes the experience to date with anti-Abeta mAbs to enter clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease and examines the evidence for clinical efficacy and the major problems with safety-i.e., amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. As mAbs differ considerably with regard to their epitopes and the conformations of Abeta that they recognize (monomers, oligomers, protofibrils, fibrils), the consequences of targeting different species are also considered. An often-cited explanation for the failure of anti-Abeta mAb trials is that they are set too late in the disease process. New trials are indeed evaluating treatments at prodromal and preclinical stages. We should expect to see additional studies of presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease to join the ongoing prevention trials, for which mAbs continue to serve as the mainstay.

28982592|t|Human amyloid beta peptide and tau co-expression impairs behavior and causes specific gene expression changes in Caenorhabditis elegans.
28982592|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the presence of extracellular amyloid plaques consisting of Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) aggregates and neurofibrillary tangles formed by aggregation of hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau. We generated a novel invertebrate model of AD by crossing Abeta1-42 (strain CL2355) with either pro-aggregating tau (strain BR5270) or anti-aggregating tau (strain BR5271) pan-neuronal expressing transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans. The lifespan and progeny viability of the double transgenic strains were significantly decreased compared with wild type N2 (P<0.0001). In addition, co-expression of these transgenes interfered with neurotransmitter signaling pathways, caused deficits in chemotaxis associative learning, increased protein aggregation visualized by Congo red staining, and increased neuronal loss. Global transcriptomic RNA-seq analysis revealed 248 up- and 805 down-regulated genes in N2 wild type versus Abeta1-42+pro-aggregating tau animals, compared to 293 up- and 295 down-regulated genes in N2 wild type versus Abeta1-42+anti-aggregating tau animals. Gene set enrichment analysis of Abeta1-42+pro-aggregating tau animals uncovered up-regulated annotation clusters UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (5 genes, P<4.2E-4), protein phosphorylation (5 genes, P<2.60E-02), and aging (5 genes, P<8.1E-2) while the down-regulated clusters included nematode cuticle collagen (36 genes, P<1.5E-21). RNA interference of 13 available top up-regulated genes in Abeta1-42+pro-aggregating tau animals revealed that F-box family genes and nep-4 could enhance life span deficits and chemotaxis deficits while Y39G8C.2 (TTBK2) could suppress these behaviors. Comparing the list of regulated genes from C. elegans to the top 60 genes related to human AD confirmed an overlap of 8 genes: patched homolog 1, PTCH1 (ptc-3), the Rab GTPase activating protein, TBC1D16 (tbc-16), the WD repeat and FYVE domain-containing protein 3, WDFY3 (wdfy-3), ADP-ribosylation factor guanine nucleotide exchange factor 2, ARFGEF2 (agef-1), Early B-cell Factor, EBF1 (unc-3), d-amino-acid oxidase, DAO (daao-1), glutamate receptor, metabotropic 1, GRM1 (mgl-2), prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit alpha 2, P4HA2 (dpy-18 and phy-2). Taken together, our C. elegans double transgenic model provides insight on the fundamental neurobiologic processes underlying human AD and recapitulates selected transcriptomic changes observed in human AD brains.

28987033|t|TREM2 expression in the human brain: a marker of monocyte recruitment?
28987033|a|Mutation in the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM) 2 gene has been identified as a risk factor for several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Experimental studies using animal models of AD have highlighted a number of functions associated with TREM2 and its expression by microglial cells. It has therefore been assumed that this is also the case in humans. However, there is very limited information concerning the cellular expression of TREM2 in the human brain. As part of investigations of microglia using post-mortem resources provided by the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Studies (MRC-CFAS), we immunostained the cerebral cortex of 299 participants for TREM2 using the Sigma antibody HPA010917 and compared with the macrophage/microglial markers Iba1 and CD68. As expected, Iba1 and CD68 labeled microglia and perivascular macrophages. However, in most cases (284/299), the TREM2 antibody labelled monocytes within vascular lumens, but not microglia or perivascular macrophages. In contrast, in 5 out of 6 cases with acute infarcts, TREM2 immunoreaction identified cells within the brain parenchyma interpreted as recruited monocytes. Six cases with old infarcts contained phagocytic foamy macrophages which were CD68-positive but TREM2 negative. Our observations, using the HPA010917 anti-TREM2 antibody, suggest that TREM2 is not expressed by microglia but instead seems to be a marker of recruited monocytes in the human brain. This finding has implications with regards to the role of TREM2 as a risk factor, emphasizing the importance of systemic immune responses in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease.

28987536|t|Binding affinity toward human prion protein of some anti-prion compounds - Assessment based on QSAR modeling, molecular docking and non-parametric ranking.
28987536|a|The present study is based on the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis of binding affinity toward human prion protein (huPrPC) of quinacrine, pyridine dicarbonitrile, diphenylthiazole and diphenyloxazole analogs applying different linear and non-linear chemometric regression techniques, including univariate linear regression, multiple linear regression, partial least squares regression and artificial neural networks. The QSAR analysis distinguished molecular lipophilicity as an important factor that contributes to the binding affinity. Principal component analysis was used in order to reveal similarities or dissimilarities among the studied compounds. The analysis of in silico absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) parameters was conducted. The ranking of the studied analogs on the basis of their ADMET parameters was done applying the sum of ranking differences, as a relatively new chemometric method. The main aim of the study was to reveal the most important molecular features whose changes lead to the changes in the binding affinities of the studied compounds. Another point of view on the binding affinity of the most promising analogs was established by application of molecular docking analysis. The results of the molecular docking were proven to be in agreement with the experimental outcome.

28989083|t|Resveratrol activation of AMPK-dependent pathways is neuroprotective in human neural stem cells against amyloid-beta-induced inflammation and oxidative stress.
28989083|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with progressive memory loss resulting in dementia. Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides play a critical role in the pathogenesis of this disease, and are thought to promote inflammation and oxidative stress leading to neurodegeneration in the neocortex and hippocampus of the AD brains. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a master regulator of cellular energy homeostasis, and cell survival in response to inflammation and oxidative stress. However, the neuroprotective mechanisms by which AMPK achieves these beneficial effects in human neural stem cells (hNSCs) exposed to Abeta is still not well understood. Resveratrol is a potent activator of AMPK suggesting it may have therapeutic potential against AD. Therefore, we will test the hypothesis that the AMPK activator resveratrol protects against Abeta mediated neuronal impairment (inflammation and oxidative stress) in hNSCs. Here, Abeta-treated hNSCs had significantly decreased cell viability that correlated with increased TNF-alpha and IL-1beta inflammatory cytokine expression. Co-treatment with resveratrol significantly abrogated the Abeta-mediated effects in hNSCs, and was effectively blocked by the addition of the AMPK-specific antagonist (Compound C). These results suggest the neuroprotective effects of resveratrol are mediated by an AMPK-dependent pathway. In addition, resveratrol rescued the transcript expression levels of inhibitory kappa B kinase (IKK) in Abeta-treated hNSCs. NF-kappaB is a transcription factor with a key role in the expression of a variety of genes involved in inflammatory responses. Resveratrol prevented the Abeta-mediated increases in NF-kappaB mRNA and protein levels, and its nuclear translocation in hNSCs. Co-treatment with resveratrol also significantly restored iNOS and COX-2 levels in Abeta-treated hNSCs. Furthermore, hNSCs co-treated with resveratrol were significantly rescued from Abeta-induced oxidative stress, which correlated with reversal of the Abeta-induced mRNA decrease in oxidative defense genes (SOD-1, NRF2, Gpx1, Catalase, GSH and HO-1). Taken together, these novel findings show that activation of AMPK-dependent signaling by resveratrol rescues Abeta-mediated neurotoxicity in hNSCs, and provides evidence supporting a neuroprotective role for AMPK activating drugs in Abeta-related diseases such as AD.

28990425|t|Mendelian forms of disease and age at onset affect survival in frontotemporal dementia.
28990425|a|OBJECTIVE: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a common cause of young onset dementia. Very few reports on disease duration are currently available and predictors of survival are still undefined. The aim of the present study was to assess the natural history of FTD and to define predictors of survival. METHODS: Four hundred amd eleven FTD patients, including 294 with behavioural variant FTD, 77 with agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and 40 with semantic variant PPA, were consecutively enrolled and demographic and clinical variables carefully recorded. Each patient underwent genetic screening for monogenic disease. RESULTS: The mean survival time from onset of the symptoms was 7.8 +- 4.0 years. The presence of a pathogenic mutation (GRN, C9orf72 or MAPT) (Hazard ratio [HR] = 1.85, 95% CI 1.04-3.31, p = 0.037) and older age at disease onset (HR = 1.04, 95% CI 1.02-1.07, p = 0.002) were associated with shorter life expectancy. However, a significant negative interaction between age at onset and genetic mutation was found, suggesting that the effect of age is different in patients with and without a genetic mutation (p = 0.028). Gender, clinical phenotype or education and occupation were not associated with survival risk. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that monogenic disease and age at onset are independent predictors of survival and should be considered in future clinical intervention trials and in patients' and caregivers' counselling.

28993924|t|Effects of Acetylcholine on beta-Amyloid-Induced cPLA2 Activation in the TB Neuroectodermal Cell Line: Implications for the Pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease.
28993924|a|The role of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still considered crucial. The state of Abeta aggregation is critical in promoting neuronal loss and neuronal function impairment. Recently, we demonstrated that Acetylcholine (ACh) is neuroprotective against the toxic effects of Abeta in the cholinergic LAN-2 cells. In biophysical experiments, ACh promotes the soluble Abeta peptide conformation rather than the aggregation-prone beta-sheet conformation. In order to better understand the biological role of ACh in AD, we studied the effect of Abeta on the phosphorylation of the cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) in the TB neuroectodermal cell line, which differentiates toward a neuronal phenotype when cultured in the presence of retinoic acid (RA). We chose the phosphorylated form of cPLA2 (Ser505, Phospho-cPLA2) as a biomarker to test the influence of ACh on the effects of Abeta in both undifferentiated and RA-differentiated TB cells. Our results show that TB cells are responsive to Abeta. Moreover, in undifferentiated cells 1 h treatment with Abeta induces a 2.5-fold increase of the Phospho-cPLA2 level compared to the control after 24 h in vitro, while no significant difference is observed between Abeta-treated and non-treated cells after 4 and 7 days in vitro. The RA-differentiated cells are not sensitive to Abeta. In TB cell line ACh is able to blunt the effects of Abeta. The ability of ACh to protect non-cholinergic cells against Abeta reinforces the hypothesis that, in addition to its role in cholinergic transmission, ACh could also act as a neuroprotective agent.

29018162|t|Clinical utility of amyloid PET imaging with (18)F-florbetapir: a retrospective study of 100 patients.
29018162|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Amyloid-positron emission tomography (PET) imaging (API) detects amyloid-beta pathology early in the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with high sensitivity and specificity. (18)F-florbetapir (Amyvid) is an amyloid-binding PET ligand with a half-life suitable for clinical use outside of the research setting. How API affects patient investigation and management in the 'real-world' arena is unknown. To address this, we retrospectively documented the effect of API in patients in the memory clinic. METHODS: We reviewed the presenting clinical features, the pre-API and post-API investigations, diagnosis and outcomes for the first 100 patients who had API as part of their routine work-up at the Imperial Memory Centre, a tertiary referral clinic in the UK National Health Service. RESULTS: API was primarily used to investigate patients with atypical clinical features (56 cases) or those that were young at onset (42 cases). MRI features of AD did not always predict positive API (67%), and 6 of 23 patients with MRIs reported as normal were amyloid-PET positive. There were significantly more cases categorised as non-AD dementia post-API (from 11 to 23). Patients investigated when API was initially available had fewer overall investigations and all patients had significantly fewer investigations in total post-API. CONCLUSIONS: API has a clear impact on the investigation of young-onset or complex dementia while reducing the overall burden of investigations. It was most useful in younger patients, atypical presentations or individuals with multiple possible causes of cognitive impairment.

29020652|t|Negatively charged food additive dye "Allura Red" rapidly induces SDS-soluble amyloid fibril in beta-lactoglobulin protein.
29020652|a|Recent studies have led to an increased interest to categorize small molecular inhibitors of protein fibrillation. In this study, we used spectroscopy, microscopy and gel electrophoresis techniques that provides an elaborated description of the Allura Red-induced amyloid fibrillation in the beta-LG protein at two pHs (7.4 and 3.5). The spectroscopy results show that beta-LG protein form aggregates in the presence of Allura Red (0.04-15.0mM) at pH 3.5 due to electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. However, at pH 7.4, the beta-LG does not interact electrostatically with Allura Red and therefore no aggregation occurred. The Allura Red-induced aggregates have an amyloid-like structure that was confirmed by far-UV CD, Congo Red and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The CD spectrum of beta-LG contains single minima at ~218nm, which shifts towards higher wavelength minima at ~225nm in the presence of Allura Red, characteristics of the cross beta-sheet structure. The TEM results suggest that beta-LG form long straight fibril when exposed to Allura Red at pH 3.5. The Allura Red-induced amyloid fibril is SDS-soluble confirmed by SDS-PAGE techniques. A far UV CD result shows the conversion of Allura Red induced cross beta-sheet structure into alpha-helical structure in the presence of increasing concentration of SDS. The results of this study suggest that the electrostatic, as well as hydrophobic interactions play an important role during Allura Red-induced beta-LG fibrillation.

29030419|t|Accuracy of clinical diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
29030419|a|BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is based on diagnostic clinical criteria, which were updated over the years. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate, through a systematic review, accuracy of the diagnostic criteria, testing a possible improvement over time. METHODS: We searched on MEDLINE and SCOPUS databases for studies reporting diagnostic parameters regarding the clinical diagnosis of DLB until October 2016. We performed meta-analysis, using a Bayesian approach, on those using pathological examination as gold standard, subclassified based on the different diagnostic criteria used. RESULTS: We selected 22 studies on 1585 patients. Pooled sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 60.2%, 93.8%, 79.7%, respectively, for criteria antecedents to McKeith 1996. For McKeith 1996-possible, pooled sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 65.6%, 80.6%, 77.9% in early stages and 72.3%, 64.3%, 66% in late stages, respectively. For McKeith 1996-probable, pooled sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 19.4%, 95.1%, 77.7% in early stages and 48.6%, 88%, 79.2% in late stages, respectively. McKeith criteria 2005 were evaluated only in late stages: pooled sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 91.3%, 66.7% and 81.6%, respectively, for possible diagnosis (only one study) and 88.3%, 80.8%, 90.7% for probable diagnosis, decreasing to 85.6%, 77.1% and 81.7% if only considering clinical settings focused on dementia diagnosis and care. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Diagnostic criteria have become more sensitive and less specific over time, without substantial change in the accuracy. Based on current data, about 20% of DLB diagnosis are incorrect. Future studies are needed to evaluate if the recently released revised consensus criteria will improve the diagnostic accuracy of DLB.

29036829|t|microRNA 221 Targets ADAM10 mRNA and is Downregulated in Alzheimer's Disease.
29036829|a|ADAM10 is the alpha-secretase that cleaves amyloid-beta protein precursor in the non-amyloidogenic pathway in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is known to be regulated by different microRNAs (miRNAs), which are post-transcriptional regulators related to several biological and pathological processes, including AD. Here we proposed to explore and validate miRNAs that have direct or indirect relations to the AD pathophysiology and ADAM10 gene. Approximately 700 miRNAs were analyzed and 21 differentially expressed miRNAs were validated in a sample of 21 AD subjects and 17 cognitively healthy matched controls. SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with miR-144-5p, miR-221, and miR-374 mimics and inhibitors, and ADAM10 protein levels were evaluated. miR-144-5p, miR-221, and miR-374 were downregulated in AD. The overexpression of miR-221 in SH-SY5Y cells resulted in ADAM10 reduction and its inhibition in ADAM10 increased. These findings show that miR-221 can be a new potential therapeutic target for increasing ADAM10 levels in AD. In addition, these results can contribute to the better understanding of ADAM10 post-transcriptional regulation.

29037101|t|The potential of solanezumab and gantenerumab to prevent Alzheimer's disease in people with inherited mutations that cause its early onset.
29037101|a|INTRODUCTION: The recent failure of several clinical trials on anti-beta-amyloid (Abeta) drugs in Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggested earlier intervention in the disease course. Secondary prevention trials have been started in autosomal-dominant AD (ADAD) individuals without cognitive dysfunction and in cognitively healthy subjects at risk of developing sporadic AD (SAD). AREAS COVERED: Herein, the authors discuss prevention trials in ADAD and SAD, with a focus on the anti-Abeta monoclonal antibodies solanezumab and gantenerumab presently in Phase III clinical development. These therapies are also being tested in the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network Trials Unit (DIAN-TU). EXPERT OPINION: Anti-Abeta monoclonal antibodies are being tested in subjects at the preclinical stage of ADAD and even in symptom-free subjects at risk of developing SAD. The subsequent DIAN-TU Adaptive Prevention Trial is a 4-year study that will assess whether such biomarker effects may stop the progress of the AD process, preventing cognitive symptoms. The hope is to interfere in the disease course when it is not too late. A clinical success of these prevention trials would represent the proof of the Abeta hypothesis of AD.

29038004|t|Flavonoid-rich ethanol extract from the leaves of Diospyros kaki attenuates cognitive deficits, amyloid-beta production, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation in APP/PS1 transgenic mice.
29038004|a|Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) initiates a cascade of pathological events, including activation of microglial cells, oxidative stress, and inflammation, leading to neuronal death and the typical pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Flavonoids have been reported to exert neuroprotective activities, not only through their generally accepted antioxidant effects, but also through their ability to protect against neurotoxin-induced injury. Flavonoids reduce Abeta production, inhibit neuroinflammation, increase cerebrovascular function, and improve cognitive performance. Here, we analyzed the effects of a flavonoid-rich ethanol extract from the leaves of Diospyros kaki (FLDK) in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. We found that oral treatment with FLDK reversed learning and memory impairment, reduced Abeta burden and expression of beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE1), and decreased microglial activation in senile plaques. FLDK restored antioxidant enzyme activities, as well as reduced the lipid peroxidation product, malondialdehyde, and inflammatory mediators. These results demonstrate that FLDK alleviates cognitive decline and reduces Abeta burden, microglial activation, oxidative stress, and inflammation responses. Thus, FLDK treatment may be a potential therapeutic strategy for preventing and treating AD, at least in part via its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory biological activities and its effect on the Abeta producing enzyme BACE1.

29040655|t|Effects of 1950 MHz radiofrequency electromagnetic fields on Abeta processing in human neuroblastoma and mouse hippocampal neuronal cells.
29040655|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease leading to progressive loss of memory and other cognitive functions. One of the well-known pathological markers of AD is the accumulation of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta), and its plaques, in the brain. Recent studies using Tg-5XFAD mice as a model of AD have reported that exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) from cellular phones reduced Abeta plaques in the brain and showed beneficial effects on AD. In this study, we examined whether exposure to 1950 MHz RF-EMF affects Abeta processing in neural cells. We exposed HT22 mouse hippocampal neuronal cells and SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells to RF-EMF (SAR 6 W/kg) for 2 h per day for 3 days, and analyzed the mRNA and protein expression of the key genes related to Abeta processing. When exposed to RF-EMF, mRNA levels of APP, BACE1, ADAM10 and PSEN1 were decreased in HT22, but the mRNA level of APP was not changed in SH-SY5Y cells. The protein expression of APP and BACE1, as well as the secreted Abeta peptide, was not significantly different between RF-EMF-exposed 7w-PSML, HT22 and SH-SY5Y cells and the unexposed controls. These observations suggest that RF-EMF exposure may not have a significant physiological effect on Abeta processing of neural cells in the short term. However, considering that we only exposed HT22 and SH-SY5Y cells to RF-EMF for 2 h per day for 3 days, we cannot exclude the possibility that 1950 MHz RF-EMF induces physiological change in Abeta processing with long-term and continuous exposure.

29048250|t|Inhibition of Abeta Proteotoxicity by Paeoniflorin in Caenorhabditis elegans Through Regulation of Oxidative and Heat Shock Stress Responses.
29048250|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common form of dementia and amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) aggregation is considered to be one of its main causes. Paeoniflorin has been previously shown to attenuate cognitive damage inflicted by exogenous Abeta protein. Using transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans models expressing human Abeta1-42, we demonstrate here that paeoniflorin can delay progressive paralysis caused by endogenous Abeta expression and reduce the amount of toxic Abeta oligomers in vivo, although it has no effect on Abeta aggregation in vitro. Paeoniflorin does not, however, affect the lifespan of either wild-type or AD-like nematodes, implying a mechanism independent of a general antiaging effect. We then demonstrate that paeoniflorin can reduce reactive oxygen species levels in C. elegans AD models, which may contribute to its in vivo suppression of Abeta toxicity. Moreover, paeoniflorin is shown to upregulate the expression of the small heat shock protein HSP-16.2 as it is capable of increasing the hsp-16.2 transcript level in wild-type as well as AD-like nematodes and enhancing the fluorescence intensity in hsp-16.2::GFP nematodes. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the underlying mechanisms of the protective effect of paeoniflorin against age-onset Abeta proteotoxicity, which are, in part, connected with oxidative and heat shock stress responses.

29050859|t|Neuroprotective effects of a triple GLP-1/GIP/glucagon receptor agonist in the APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
29050859|a|Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD). Previous studies have shown that the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) that have anti-diabetic properties show very promising effects in animal models of AD. Glucagon (Gcg) is a hormone and growth-factor, and the Gcg receptor is expressed in the brain. Here we test the effects of a triple receptor agonist (TA), which activates GIP-1, GIP and glucagon receptors at the same time. In the present study, the effects of the TA were evaluated in the APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model of AD. The TA was injected once-daily (10 nmol/kg i.p.) for two months. The results showed that treatment with TA significantly reversed the memory deficit in the APP/PS1 mice in a spatial water maze test. Moreover, the drug reduced levels of the mitochondrial pro-apoptotic signaling molecule BAX, increased the anti-apoptotic signaling molecule Bcl-2 and enhanced the levels of BDNF, a key growth factor that protects synaptic function. Levels of synaptophysin were enhanced, demonstrating protection from synaptic loss that is observed in AD. Neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus was furthermore enhanced as shown in the increase of doublecortin positive cells. Furthermore, TA treatment reduced the total amount of beta-amyloid, reduced neuroinflammation (activated microglia and astrocytes), and oxidative stress in the cortex and hippocampus. Thus, these findings show that novel TAs are a promising lead for the design of future treatment strategies in AD.

29053771|t|The cerebellum in Alzheimer's disease: evaluating its role in cognitive decline.
29053771|a|The cerebellum has long been regarded as essential only for the coordination of voluntary motor activity and motor learning. Anatomical, clinical and neuroimaging studies have led to a paradigm shift in the understanding of the cerebellar role in nervous system function, demonstrating that the cerebellum appears integral also to the modulation of cognition and emotion. The search to understand the cerebellar contribution to cognitive processing has increased interest in exploring the role of the cerebellum in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Principal among these is Alzheimer's disease. Here we review an already sizeable existing literature on the neuropathological, structural and functional neuroimaging studies of the cerebellum in Alzheimer's disease. We consider these observations in the light of the cognitive deficits that characterize Alzheimer's disease and in so doing we introduce a new perspective on its pathophysiology and manifestations. We propose an integrative hypothesis that there is a cerebellar contribution to the cognitive and neuropsychiatric deficits in Alzheimer's disease. We draw on the dysmetria of thought theory to suggest that this cerebellar component manifests as deficits in modulation of the neurobehavioural deficits. We provide suggestions for future studies to investigate this hypothesis and, ultimately, to establish a comprehensive, causal clinicopathological disease model.

29054920|t|CSF beta-amyloid and white matter damage: a new perspective on Alzheimer's disease.
29054920|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the connection between amyloid pathology and white matter (WM) macrostructural and microstructural damage in demented patients compared with controls. METHODS: Eighty-five participants were recruited: 65 with newly diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (AD), non-AD dementia or mild cognitive impairment and 20 age-matched and sex-matched healthy controls. beta-amyloid1-42 (Abeta) levels were determined in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from all patients and five controls. Among patients, 42 had pathological CSF Abeta levels (Abeta(+)), while 23 had normal CSF Abeta levels (Abeta(-)). All participants underwent neurological examination, neuropsychological testing and brain MRI. We used T2-weighted scans to quantify WM lesion loads (LLs) and diffusion-weighted images to assess their microstructural substrate. Non-parametric statistical tests were used for between-group comparisons and multiple regression analyses. RESULTS: We found an increased WM-LL in Abeta(+) compared with both, healthy controls (p=0.003) and Abeta(-) patients (p=0.02). Interestingly, CSF Abeta concentration was the best predictor of patients' WM-LL (r=-0.30, p<0.05) when using age as a covariate. Lesion apparent diffusion coefficient value was higher in all patients than in controls (p=0.0001) and correlated with WM-LL (r=0.41, p=0.001). In Abeta(+), WM-LL correlated with WM microstructural damage in the left peritrigonal WM (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: WM damage is crucial in AD pathogenesis. The correlation between CSF Abeta levels and WM-LL suggests a direct link between amyloid pathology and WM macrostructural and microstructural damage.

29055813|t|Amyloid beta synaptotoxicity is Wnt-PCP dependent and blocked by fasudil.
29055813|a|INTRODUCTION: Synapse loss is the structural correlate of the cognitive decline indicative of dementia. In the brains of Alzheimer's disease sufferers, amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides aggregate to form senile plaques but as soluble peptides are toxic to synapses. We previously demonstrated that Abeta induces Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1), which in turn activates the Wnt-planar cell polarity (Wnt-PCP) pathway to drive tau pathology and neuronal death. METHODS: We compared the effects of Abeta and of Dkk1 on synapse morphology and memory impairment while inhibiting or silencing key elements of the Wnt-PCP pathway. RESULTS: We demonstrate that Abeta synaptotoxicity is also Dkk1 and Wnt-PCP dependent, mediated by the arm of Wnt-PCP regulating actin cytoskeletal dynamics via Daam1, RhoA and ROCK, and can be blocked by the drug fasudil. DISCUSSION: Our data add to the importance of aberrant Wnt signaling in Alzheimer's disease neuropathology and indicate that fasudil could be repurposed as a treatment for the disease.

29056359|t|Sortilin inhibits amyloid pathology by regulating non-specific degradation of APP.
29056359|a|Amyloid plaque is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The key component beta-amyloid (Abeta) is generated via proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Sortilin (encoded by the gene Sort1) is a vacuolar protein sorting 10 protein domain-containing receptor, which is up-regulated in the brain of AD, colocalizes with amyloid plaques and interacts with APP. However, its role in amyloidogenesis remains unclear. In this study, we first found that the protein level of sortilin was up-regulated in the neocortex of aged (7 and 9months old) but not young (2 and 5months old) AD mice (APP/PS1). 9months old APP/PS1 transgenic mice with Sort1 gene knockout showed increased amyloid pathology in the brain; and this phenotype was rescued by intrahippocampal injection of AAV-hSORT1. Moreover, the 9months old APP/PS1 mice without Sort1 also displayed a decreased number of neurons and increased astrocyte activation in the hippocampus. In addition, the present study showed that the intracellular domain of sortilin was involved in the regulation of the non-specific degradation of APP. Together, our findings indicate that sortilin is a beneficial protein for the reduction of amyloid pathology in APP/PS1 mice by promoting APP degradation.

29059270|t|Comprehension of an Elevated Amyloid Positron Emission Tomography Biomarker Result by Cognitively Normal Older Adults.
29059270|a|Importance: The goal of Alzheimer disease (AD) prevention together with advances in understanding the pathophysiology of AD have led to clinical trials testing drugs in cognitively unimpaired persons who show evidence of AD biomarkers. Data are needed to inform the processes of describing AD biomarkers to cognitively normal adults and assessing their understanding of this knowledge. Objective: To determine the comprehension of an elevated amyloid positron emission tomographic (PET) biomarker result by cognitively unimpaired adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Study of Knowledge and Reactions to Amyloid Testing, a substudy of an AD prevention trial, involved 2 semistructured telephone interviews with 80 participants recruited from 9 study sites: 50 received elevated and 30 received not elevated amyloid PET scan results. Interviews were conducted 4 to 12 weeks after result disclosure and again 1 year later. Data presented here were collected from November 5, 2014, through December 10, 2015. The 50 participants included in this study were cognitively normal, aged 65 to 85 years, evenly distributed by gender, and had elevated amyloid PET results. Subsequent reports will examine persons with "not elevated" results and compare the influence of the different results. Main Outcomes and Measures: Participant comprehension of an elevated amyloid result was assessed by analyzing their responses to the following questions: "What was the result of your amyloid PET scan?" (followed by "Can you tell me in your own words what that means?" or "How would you explain it to a friend?"), "Was it the result you expected?" and "Did the result teach you anything or clarify anything for you?" Results: Of the 50 participants aged 65 to 85 years, 49 (98%) were white, 40 (80%) reported a family history of AD, and 30 (60%) had a postgraduate educational level. Most participants (31 [62%]) understood that elevated amyloid conferred an increased but uncertain risk of developing AD. Some desired understanding of the term elevated other than its being a categorical result enabling trial entry eligibility; they wanted information regarding how elevated their amyloid was, how close to the study threshold they were, or percentages, numbers, or a scale to help them make sense of the result. Conclusions and Relevance: Including an explanation of how and why a dimensional biomarker is converted to a categorical classification would enhance future AD biomarker clinical trials and educational materials.

29063518|t|Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Safety of ALZ-801, a Novel Prodrug of Tramiprosate in Development for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.
29063518|a|BACKGROUND: ALZ-801 is an orally available, valine-conjugated prodrug of tramiprosate. Tramiprosate, the active agent, is a small-molecule beta-amyloid (Abeta) anti-oligomer and aggregation inhibitor that was evaluated extensively in preclinical and clinical investigations for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tramiprosate has been found to inhibit beta-amyloid oligomer formation by a multi-ligand enveloping mechanism of action that stabilizes Abeta42 monomers, resulting in the inhibition of formation of oligomers and subsequent aggregation. Although promising as an AD treatment, tramiprosate exhibited two limiting deficiencies: high intersubject pharmacokinetic (PK) variability likely due to extensive gastrointestinal metabolism, and mild-to-moderate incidence of nausea and vomiting. To address these, we developed an optimized prodrug, ALZ-801, which retains the favorable efficacy attributes of tramiprosate while improving oral PK variability and gastrointestinal tolerability. In this study, we summarize the phase I bridging program to evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK for ALZ-801 after single and multiple rising dose administration in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Randomized, placebo-controlled, phase I studies in 127 healthy male and female adult and elderly volunteers included [1] a single ascending dose (SAD) study; [2] a 14-day multiple ascending dose (MAD) study; and [3] a single-dose tablet food-effect study. This program was conducted with both a loose-filled capsule and an immediate-release tablet formulation, under both fasted and fed conditions. Safety and tolerability were assessed, and plasma and urine were collected for liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) determination and non-compartmental PK analysis. In addition, we defined the target dose of ALZ-801 that delivers a steady-state plasma area under the curve (AUC) exposure of tramiprosate equivalent to that studied in the tramiprosate phase III study. RESULTS: ALZ-801 was well tolerated and there were no severe or serious adverse events (AEs) or laboratory findings. The most common AEs were transient mild nausea and some instances of vomiting, which were not dose-related and showed development of tolerance after continued use. ALZ-801 produced dose-dependent maximum plasma concentration (C max) and AUC exposures of tramiprosate, which were equivalent to that after oral tramiprosate, but with a substantially reduced intersubject variability and a longer elimination half-life. Administration of ALZ-801 with food markedly reduced the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms compared with the fasted state, without affecting plasma tramiprosate exposure. An immediate-release tablet formulation of ALZ-801 displayed plasma exposure and low variability similar to the loose-filled capsule. ALZ-801 also showed excellent dose-proportionality without accumulation or decrease in plasma exposure of tramiprosate over 14 days. Based on these data, 265 mg of ALZ-801 twice daily was found to achieve a steady-state AUC exposure of tramiprosate equivalent to 150 mg twice daily of oral tramiprosate in the previous phase III trials. CONCLUSIONS: ALZ-801, when administered in capsule and tablet forms, showed excellent oral safety and tolerability in healthy adults and elderly volunteers, with significantly improved PK characteristics over oral tramiprosate. A clinical dose of ALZ-801 (265 mg twice daily) was established that achieves the AUC exposure of 150 mg of tramiprosate twice daily, which showed positive cognitive and functional improvements in apolipoprotein E4/4 homozygous AD patients. These bridging data support the phase III development of ALZ-801in patients with AD.

29070646|t|Amyloid-PET burden and regional distribution in cerebral amyloid angiopathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis of biomarker performance.
29070646|a|INTRODUCTION: We performed a meta-analysis to synthesise current evidence on amyloid-positron emission tomography (PET) burden and presumed preferential occipital distribution in sporadic cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). METHODS: In a PubMed systematic search, we identified case-control studies with extractable data on global and occipital-to-global amyloid-PET uptake in symptomatic patients with CAA (per Boston criteria) versus control groups (healthy participants or patients with non-CAA deep intracerebral haemorrhage) and patients with Alzheimer's disease. To circumvent PET studies' methodological variation, we generated and used 'fold change', that is, ratio of mean amyloid uptake (global and occipital-to-global) of CAA relative to comparison groups. Amyloid-PET uptake biomarker performance was then quantified by random-effects meta-analysis on the ratios of the means. A ratio >1 indicates that amyloid-PET uptake (global or occipital/global) is higher in CAA than comparison groups, and a ratio <1 indicates the reverse. RESULTS: Seven studies, including 106 patients with CAA (>90% with probable CAA) and 138 controls (96 healthy elderly, 42 deep intracerebral haemorrhage controls) and 72 patients with Alzheimer's disease, were included. Global amyloid-PET ratio between patients with CAA and controls was above 1, with an average effect size of 1.18 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.28; p<0.0001). Occipital-to-global amyloid-PET uptake ratio did not differ between patients with CAA versus patients with deep intracerebral haemorrhage or healthy controls. By contrast, occipital-to-global amyloid-PET uptake ratio was above 1 in patients with CAA versus those with Alzheimer's disease, with an average ratio of 1.10 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.19; p=0.009) and high statistical heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis provides exploratory actionable data on the overall effect sizes and strength of amyloid-PET burden and distribution in patients with CAA, useful for future larger studies.

29071500|t|Temporal association patterns and dynamics of amyloid-beta and tau in Alzheimer's disease.
29071500|a|The elusive relationship between underlying pathology and clinical disease hampers diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and preventative intervention development. We seek to understand the relationship between two classical AD biomarkers, amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta1-42) and total-tau (t-tau), and define their trajectories across disease development, as defined by disease onset at diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Using longitudinal data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we performed a correlation analysis of biomarkers CSF Abeta1-42 and t-tau, and longitudinal quantile analysis. Using a mixed effects model, with MCI onset as an anchor, we develop linear trajectories to describe the rate of change across disease development. These trajectories were extended through the incorporation of data from cognitively normal, healthy adults (aged 20-62 years) from the literature, to fit sigmoid curves by means of non-linear least squares estimators, to create curves encompassing the 50 years prior to MCI onset. A strong right-angled relationship between the biomarkers Abeta1-42 and t-tau is detected, implying a highly non-linear relationship. The rate of change of Abeta1-42 is correlated with the baseline concentration per quantile, reflecting a reduction in the rate of loss across disease within subjects. Regression models reveal significant amyloid loss relative to MCI onset (- 2.35 pg/mL/year), compared to minimal loss relative to AD onset (- 0.97 pg/mL/year). Tau accumulates consistently relative to MCI and AD onset, (2.05 pg/mL/year) and (2.46 pg/mL/year), respectively. The fitted amyloid curve shows peak loss of amyloid 8.06 years prior to MCI diagnosis, while t-tau exhibits peak accumulation 14.17 years following MCI diagnosis, with the upper limit not yet reached 30 years post diagnosis. Biomarker trajectories aid unbiased, objective assessment of disease progression. Quantitative trajectories are likely to be of use in clinical trial design, as they allow for a more detailed insight into the effectiveness of treatments designed to delay development of biological disease.

29073556|t|Glucocorticoid may influence amyloid beta metabolism in patients with depression.
29073556|a|Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that depression may be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the biological mechanisms of the transition from depression to AD are still not clear. Changes of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) metabolism and increased glucocorticoid (GC) levels have been found in both depression and AD. Moreover, several studies in animal models have demonstrated that GC administration changes Abeta metabolism. To reveal whether GC affects amyloid metabolism in patients with depression, we evaluated serum levels of Abeta40, Abeta42 and cortisol at admission in 187 inpatients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 224 healthy comparisons. Additionally, we re-evaluated the serum levels of Abetas in 27 patients with MDD 1 year later. The results of multiple regression analyses revealed that serum cortisol and Abeta levels are not correlated at the time of admission. However, serum cortisol levels at admission correlated with serum Abeta42 levels and Abeta40/Abeta42 ratio 1 year later. These findings suggest that increased cortisol in patients with MDD may influence the metabolism of Abeta over prolonged periods of time.

29079292|t|P2X receptor overexpression induced by soluble oligomers of amyloid beta peptide potentiates synaptic failure and neuronal dyshomeostasis in cellular models of Alzheimer's disease.
29079292|a|The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease. The etiology of the disease is unknown, although considerable evidence suggests a critical role for the soluble oligomers of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta). Because Abeta increases the expression of purinergic receptors (P2XRs) in vitro and in vivo, we studied the functional correlation between long-term exposure to Abeta and the ability of P2XRs to modulate network synaptic tone. We used electrophysiological recordings and Ca2+ microfluorimetry to assess the effects of chronic exposure (24 h) to Abeta oligomers (0.5 muM) together with known inhibitors of P2XRs, such as PPADS and apyrase on synaptic function. Changes in the expression of P2XR were quantified using RT-qPCR. We observed changes in the expression of P2X1R, P2X7R and an increase in P2X2R; and also in protein levels in PC12 cells (143%) and hippocampal neurons (120%) with Abeta. In parallel, the reduction on the frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs (72% and 35%, respectively) were prevented by P2XR inhibition using a low PPADS concentration. Additionally, the current amplitude and intracellular Ca2+ signals evoked by extracellular ATP were increased (70% and 75%, respectively), suggesting an over activation of purinergic neurotransmission in cells pre-treated with Abeta. Taken together, our findings suggest that Abeta disrupts the main components of synaptic transmission at both pre- and post-synaptic sites, and induces changes in the expression of key P2XRs, especially P2X2R; changing the neuromodulator function of the purinergic tone that could involve the P2X2R as a key factor for cytotoxic mechanisms. These results identify novel targets for the treatment of dementia and other diseases characterized by increased purinergic transmission.

29080748|t|Overexpression of SNX7 reduces Abeta production by enhancing lysosomal degradation of APP.
29080748|a|Abnormal production of amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) by proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) is thought to be central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although many efforts have been made to investigate mechanisms that regulate APP processing, many details remain incompletely understood. Sorting nexins (SNXs) are a family of proteins which are involved in many intracellular trafficking events. Several SNXs have been implicated in APP processing and Abeta production. In this study, we extended the investigation to SNX7. We found that overexpression of SNX7 in HEK293T cells reduces the levels of secreted Abeta and beta-cleaved N-terminal APP fragments (sAPPbeta). Moreover, SNX7 overexpression caused a significant reduction of the steady-state levels of APP as well as of the cell surface APP levels. By using NH4Cl and Bafilomycin A1 to inhibit the lysosomal degradative pathway, we found that the reduction of APP induced by SNX7 overexpression was prevented by such inhibition. No change in the cell surface distribution or steady-state levels of BACE1 was detected after overexpression of SNX7. Taken together, these results suggest that SNX7 regulates Abeta production by directing APP for degradation.

29081063|t|Selenium and Zinc against Abeta25-35-Induced Cytotoxicity and Tau Phosphorylation in PC12 Cells and Inhibits gamma-cleavage of APP.
29081063|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) is the main component of the amyloid plaques that accumulate in the brains of Alzheimer patients. The present study was conducted to investigate whether the combined treatment with selenium (Se) and zinc (Zn) offers more beneficial effects than that provided by either of them alone in reversing Abeta25-35-induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells. Cells were pretreated with 0.1 mumol/L of Se and Zn for 4 h, after treated with 10 mmol/L Abeta25-35 for 24 h. Cells were divided into control and five treated groups, and received either 10 mmol/L Abeta25-35,10 mmol/L Abeta25-35 + 0.1 mumol/L Se, 10 mmol/L Abeta25-35 + 0.1 mumol/L Zn, 10 mmol/LAbeta25-35 + 0.1 mumol/L Se + 0.1 mumol/L Zn, or 0.1 mumol/L Se + 0.1 mumol/L Zn. The result showed that cell viability was decreased in MTT metabolic rate; LDH release and MDA, H2O2, and NO levels were increased and the GSK-3beta and phosphorylated tau protein level were increased in Abeta25-35-treated group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), which whole changes were attenuated by Se and Zn and Se combined Zn. In order to evaluate whether the Se and Zn have an effect on processing pathway of amyloid precursor protein (APP), we examined the activity of gamma-secretase in primary cultured cortical neuron cells. ELISA analysis showed that Se and Zn could inhibit the activity of gamma-secretase. Then we also investigated the effect of Se and Zn on the Abeta1-40 concentration and APP-N-terminal fragment expression from APP695 stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. APP695 stably transfected CHO cells were treated with 0.1 mumol/L Se and Zn; cells were divided into control and four treated groups, which received either 0.5 M DAPT, 0.1 mumol/L Se, 0.1 mumol/L Zn, or 0.1 mumol/L Se + 0.1 mumol/L Zn. Se and Zn could decrease Abeta1-40 production and increase the APP-N-terminal fragment protein expression. These experiments indicate that Se and Zn have a protective effect on AD pathology that a possible mechanism is inhibiting the activity of gamma-secretase to decreasing Abeta1-40 production further influencing the APP processing. Altogether, our findings may provide a novel therapeutic target to treat AD sufferers.

29092095|t|Abeta exacerbates alpha-synuclein-induced neurotoxicity through impaired insulin signaling in alpha-synuclein-overexpressed human SK-N-MC neuronal cells.
29092095|a|AIM: alpha-Synuclein (alphaSyn) is known as a small soluble protein abundantly expressed in neuronal cells. Although its physiological role is still unclear, the aggregation of alphaSyn has been recognized as responsible for some neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). In most cases, intracellular abnormal aggregates are caused by protein-coding mutations that alter primary structure and therefore increase propensity toward aggregation. However, no pathogenic alterations or polymorphisms in alphaSyn are found in DLB patients so far, suggesting genetic mutations may not play a major role in DLB pathogenesis. In contrast, emerging evidence reveals that amyloid beta (Abeta) may contribute to aggregate formation and exacerbate neurotoxicity of alphaSyn. However, the underlying mechanism of action has remained unclear. METHODS: To investigate molecular pathways involved in Abeta-mediated alphaSyn pathology, we established an in vitro model for inducible alphaSyn overexpression in SK-N-MC human neuronal cells. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that Abeta treatment in alphaSyn-overexpressed neuronal cells significantly increases alphaSyn intracellular aggregation and cytotoxicity. Moreover, Abeta also caused AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibition and impaired insulin sensitivity, which leads to significant downregulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2)/heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) antioxidant signaling to elicit alphaSyn aggregation. CONCLUSIONS: This raised the possibility that insulin resistance could be one of the causative factors of alphaSyn toxicity, and the strategies for insulin sensitization may have therapeutic potential for synucleinopathies including DLB.

29097202|t|Distinct amyloid precursor protein processing machineries of the olfactory system.
29097202|a|Processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) occurs through sequential cleavages first by beta-secretase and then by the gamma-secretase complex. However, abnormal processing of APP leads to excessive production of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in the central nervous system (CNS), an event which is regarded as a primary cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In particular, gene mutations of the gamma-secretase complex-which contains presenilin 1 or 2 as the catalytic core-could trigger marked Abeta accumulation. Olfactory dysfunction usually occurs before the onset of typical AD-related symptoms (eg, memory loss or muscle retardation), suggesting that the olfactory system may be one of the most vulnerable regions to AD. To date however, little is known about why the olfactory system is affected so early by AD prior to other regions. Thus, we examined the distribution of secretases and levels of APP processing in the olfactory system under either healthy or pathological conditions. Here, we show that the olfactory system has distinct APP processing machineries. In particular, we identified higher expressions levels and activity of gamma-secretase in the olfactory epithelium (OE) than other regions of the brain. Moreover, APP c-terminal fragments (CTF) are markedly detected. During AD progression, we note increased expression of presenilin2 of gamma-secretases in the OE, not in the OB, and show that neurotoxic Abeta*56 accumulates more quickly in the OE. Taken together, these results suggest that the olfactory system has distinct APP processing machineries under healthy and pathological conditions. This finding may provide a crucial understanding of the unique APP-processing mechanisms in the olfactory system, and further highlights the correlation between olfactory deficits and AD symptoms.

29100755|t|Total flavonoid extract from Dracoephalum moldavica L. attenuates beta-amyloid-induced toxicity through anti-amyloidogenesic and neurotrophic pathways.
29100755|a|AIMS: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder characterized by global cognitive impairment that involves accumulation of amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) in the brain. Herbal approaches can be used as alternative medicines to slow the progression of AD. This study aimed to determine the beneficial effects and potential underlying mechanisms of total flavonoid extract from Dracoephalum moldavica L. (TFDM) for attenuating Alzheimer-related deficits induced by Abeta. MAIN METHODS: We used amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS1) double transgenic mice and copper-injured APP Swedish mutation overexpressing SH-SY5Y cells to evaluate the beneficial effects of TFDM. Further, identifying the mechanisms of action was conducted on anti-amyloidogenic and neurotrophic transductions. KEY FINDINGS: Our results indicated that TFDM treatment ameliorated cognitive impairments and neurodegeneration and improved the antioxidant defense system in APP/PS1 mice. TFDM also reduced Abeta burden by relieving Abeta deposition, decreasing insoluble Abeta levels, and inhibiting beta-amyloidogenic processing pathway involving downregulation of beta-secretase and beta-C-terminal fragment in the brain. In the in vitro model of AD, TFDM treatment protected injured cells, and combined with the beneficial effects of decreasing APP levels, lowered Abeta1-42 and regulated the redox imbalance. Moreover, TFDM preserved the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/cAMP response element-binding protein/brain-derived neurotrophic factor pathway both in vitro and in vivo. SIGNIFICANCE: In conclusion, TFDM clearly demonstrated neuroprotective effects by restoring the anti-amyloidogenic and neurotrophic transductions in the context of AD-associated deficits. These findings indicate the potential use of herb-based substances as supplements or potential alternative supplements for attenuating the progression of AD.

29103036|t|The Unexpected Role of Abeta1-42 Monomers in the Pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease.
29103036|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) has been proposed as a biomarker and a drug target for the therapy of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The neurotoxic entity and relevance of each conformational form of Abeta to AD pathology is still under debate; Abeta oligomers are considered the major killer form of the peptide whereas monomers have been proposed to be involved in physiological process. Here we reviewed some different effects mediated by monomers and oligomers on mechanisms involved in AD pathogenesis such as autophagy and tau aggregation. Data reported in this review demonstrate that Abeta monomers could have a major role in sustaining the pathogenesis of AD and that AD therapy should be focused not only in the removal of oligomers but also of monomers.

29106038|t|The physical approximation of APP and BACE-1: A key event in alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.
29106038|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of insoluble deposits of Amyloid beta (Abeta) in brains. Abeta is derived by sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-site secretase enzyme (BACE-1) and gamma-secretase. Proteolytic processing of APP by BACE-1 is the rate-limiting step in Abeta production, and this pathway is a prime target for AD drug development. Both APP and BACE-1 are membrane-spanning proteins, transported via secretory and endocytic pathways; and the physical interaction of APP and BACE-1 during trafficking is a key cell biological event initiating the amyloidogenic pathway. Here, we highlight recent research on intracellular trafficking/sorting of APP and BACE-1, and discuss how dysregulation of these pathways might lead to enhanced convergence of APP and BACE-1, and subsequent beta-cleavage of APP.   2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

29107146|t|NABi, a novel beta-sheet breaker, inhibits Abeta aggregation and neuronal toxicity: Therapeutic implications for Alzheimer's disease.
29107146|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) aggregates are an important therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease (AD), a fatal neurodegenerative disease. To date, AD still remains a big challenge due to no effective treatments. Based on the property that Abeta aggregates have the cross-beta-structure, a common structural feature in amyloids, we systemically designed the Abeta-aggregation inhibitor that maintains Abeta-interacting ability but removes toxic part from SOD1 (superoxide dismutase 1)-G93A. We identified NABi (Natural Abeta Binder and Abeta-aggregation inhibitor) composed of beta2-3 strands, a novel breaker of Abeta aggregation, which does not self-aggregate and has no cytotoxicity at all. The NABi blocks Abeta-fibril formation in vitro and in vivo and prevents neuronal cell death, a hallmark of AD pathogenesis. Such anti-amyloidogenic properties can provide novel strategies for treating AD. Furthermore, our study provides molecular insights into the design of amyloidogenic inhibitors to cure various neurodegenerative and amyloid-associated diseases, as NABi would regulate aggregation of other toxic beta-sheet proteins other than Abeta.

29107864|t|TRPM2 dependence of ROS-induced NLRP3 activation in Alzheimer's disease.
29107864|a|Recent studies have shown that neuroinflammation plays an important role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Microglial cells are responsible for the phagocytosis of Amyloid-beta (Abeta). However, it has been demonstrated that in AD patients the efficiency of phagocytosis decreases due to proinflammatory cytokines, such as Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), which is produced through the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. In this study, we aimed at deciphering the mechanism underlying the NLRP3 activation. The results showed that Abeta induces an increase in the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). According to this study, ROS produced from both mitochondria and NADPH oxidase was responsible for NLRP3 activation. In addition, it was observed that this high level of ROS activated the transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) channel, which causes an increase in the level of intracellular calcium. The results demonstrated that in the absence of intracellular calcium, caspase-1 cannot be activated and therefore the level of IL-1beta decreases. Altogether, our findings supported the role of TRPM2 channel in ROS-induced NLRP3 activation in microglial cells through the exposure to Abeta.

29108941|t|Both hyper- and hypo-activation to cognitive challenge are associated with increased beta-amyloid deposition in healthy aging: A nonlinear effect.
29108941|a|Beta-amyloid (Abeta) positive individuals hyper-activate brain regions compared to those not at-risk; however, hyperactivation is then thought to diminish as Alzheimer's disease symptomatology begins, evidencing eventual hypoactivation. It remains unclear when in the disease staging this transition occurs. We hypothesized that differential levels of amyloid burden would be associated with both increased and decreased activation (i.e., a quadratic trajectory) in cognitively-normal adults. Participants (N = 62; aged 51-94) underwent an fMRI spatial distance-judgment task and Amyvid-PET scanning. Voxelwise regression modeled age, linear-Abeta, and quadratic-Abeta as predictors of BOLD activation to difficult spatial distance-judgments. A significant quadratic-Abeta effect on BOLD response explained differential activation in bilateral angular/temporal and medial prefrontal cortices, such that individuals with slightly elevated Abeta burden exhibited hyperactivation whereas even higher Abeta burden was then associated with hypoactivation. Importantly, in high-Abeta individuals, Abeta load moderated the effect of BOLD activation on behavioral task performance, where in lower-elevation, greater deactivation was associated with better accuracy, but in higher-elevation, greater deactivation was associated with poorer accuracy during the task. This study reveals a dose-response, quadratic relationship between increasing Abeta burden and alterations in BOLD activation to cognitive challenge in cognitively-normal individuals that suggests 1) the shift from hyper-to hypo-activation may begin early in disease staging, 2) depends, in part, on degree of Abeta burden, and 3) tracks cognitive performance.

29111133|t|In Vivo Brain Plaque and Tangle Burden Mediates the Association Between Diastolic Blood Pressure and Cognitive Functioning in Nondemented Adults.
29111133|a|OBJECTIVE: Growing evidence supports an association between increased blood pressure and: (a) poor cognitive performance in older adults, and (b) various biomarkers of increased Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology. The objective of this study was to determine whether systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were significantly associated with cognitive functioning in non-demented adults, and to examine in vivo AD pathology as a possible mediator of this association. METHODS: Positron emission tomography (PET) scans with 2-(1-{6-[(2-[F-18]fluoroethyl)(methyl)amino]-2-naphthyl}ethylidene)malononitrile (FDDNP) provide in vivo measurements of plaque and tangle burden. A total of 101 non-demented older subjects with blood pressure data and FDDNP-PET scans were drawn from a larger study of predictors of cognitive decline. A neuropsychological test battery was used to compute "global cognitive scores" (averaged across five key domains), which served as an index of general cognitive functioning. RESULTS: Higher DBP (but not SBP) was significantly associated with lower cognitive scores, controlling for age, sex, antihypertensive medication use, and ApoE genotype (eta2 = 0.06). However, this relationship was no longer significant after introducing FDDNP-PET binding as an additional covariate in the statistical models. In vivo plaque and tangle burden accounted for over 30% of the observed association between higher DBP and poorer cognitive performance. CONCLUSIONS: By suggesting a mediation of the relationship between DBP and cognitive functioning by FDDNP-PET binding, this study advances our understanding of some potential predictors of cognitive decline in non-demented adults, and underscores the importance of devising early multimodal interventions to more effectively combat degenerative brain disorders.

29111606|t|Incubation with Cu(II) and Zn(II) salts enhances MALDI-TOF mass spectra of amyloid-beta and alpha-synuclein toward in vivo analysis.
29111606|a|Insoluble senile plaque aggregates are indicative of Alzheimer's disease pathology. A similar phenomenon occurs in Parkinson's disease with the build-up of Lewy bodies. The analysis of senile plaques, and other brain samples, from Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease patients by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry has advantages but also presents obstacles because of the nature of the processes utilized in isolation procedures and storage. Salts, buffers, and detergents necessary in the isolation of biological species may cause adducts and ion suppression that convolute the spectra obtained. We previously determined that amyloid-beta from isolated senile plaque deposits fragment similarly to the synthetic 40 and 42 amino acid peptide when analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. In addition, alpha-synuclein also fragments predictably by in-source decay. This provides information that may be applied to the identification and localization of amyloid-beta and alpha-synuclein in senile plaques and intact tissue sections. Ion suppression must still be accounted for when analyzing biological samples, which makes identifying fragments at lower abundance difficult. The addition of certain transition-metal salts (Cu(II), Zn(II)) to the sample prior to analysis serves to "clean" the spectra and allow the peptide fragments produced to be observed with a much higher signal to noise and occasionally, improved resolution. We present a systematic study of incubation with different metal salts and their impact on the quality of the spectra, as well as the role of the binding of the metals to the model biological compounds, obtained for synthetic amyloid-beta, synthetic alpha-synuclein, and isolated senile plaques. The optimized sample preparation methods presented will provide for simpler and more thorough identification of these biologically relevant species in human-derived samples.

29114732|t|Amyloid beta Deposition and Suspected Non-Alzheimer Pathophysiology and Cognitive Decline Patterns for 12 Years in Oldest Old Participants Without Dementia.
29114732|a|Importance: The prevalence of pathologic conditions of the brain associated with Alzheimer disease increases strongly with age. Little is known about the distribution and clinical significance of preclinical biomarker staging in the oldest old, when most individuals without dementia are likely to have positive biomarkers. Objective: To compare the patterns of long-term cognitive decline in multiple domains by preclinical biomarker status in the oldest old without dementia. Design, Setting, and Participants: A longitudinal observational study with a mean (SD) of 12.2 (2.2) years (range 7.2-15.1 years) of follow-up was conducted in an academic medical center from August 24, 2000, to January 14, 2016, including and extending observations from the Ginkgo Evaluation of Memory study. A total of 197 adults who had completed the Ginkgo Evaluation of Memory study, were free of dementia, and were able to undergo magnetic resonance imaging were eligible for a neuroimaging study in 2009. Of these patients, 175 were included in the present analyses; 140 (80%) were cognitively normal and 35 (20%) had mild cognitive impairment. Main Outcomes and Measures: Biomarker groups included amyloid beta negative (Abeta-)/neurodegeneration negative (ND-), amyloid beta positive (Abeta+)/ND-, Abeta-/neurodegeneration positive (ND+), and Abeta+/ND+ based on Pittsburgh Compound B retention and hippocampal volume in 2009. Participants completed baseline neuropsychological testing from 2000 to 2002 and annual testing from 2004 to 2016. Domains included memory, executive function, language, visual-spatial reasoning, and attention and psychomotor speed. Slopes of decline were evaluated with linear mixed models adjusted for age, sex, and years of education. Results: Of the 175 participants (71 women and 104 men), at imaging, mean (SD) age was 86.0 (2.9) years (range, 82-95 years). A total of 42 participants (24.0%) were Abeta-/ND-, 32 (18.3%) were Abeta+/ND-, 35 (20.0%) were Abeta-/ND+, and 66 (37.7%) were Abeta+/ND+. On all cognitive measures, the Abeta+/ND+ group showed the steepest decline. Compared with the Abeta-/ND- group, the amyloid deposition alone (Abeta+/ND-) group showed faster decline on tests of verbal and visual memory (-0.3513; 95% CI, -0.5269 to -0.1756), executive function (0.0158; 95% CI, 0.0013-0.0303), and language (-0.1934; 95% CI, -0.3520 to -0.0348). The Abeta-/ND+ group showed faster visual memory decline than the Abeta-/ND- reference group (-0.3007; 95% CI, -0.4736 to -0.1279). Conclusions and Relevance: In the oldest old without dementia, presence of either or both Abeta and hippocampal atrophy is typical (>75%). Isolated hippocampal volume atrophy is associated only with greater decline in memory. However, isolated Abeta is associated with decline in memory plus language and executive functions. These findings suggest different underlying pathophysiologic processes in the Abeta+/ND- and Abeta-/ND+ groups.

29116483|t|Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET imaging of meningioma and other intracranial tumors.
29116483|a|Meningiomas are the most common intracranial tumors. Diagnosis by MRI is generally straightforward, but lack of imaging specificity can present a diagnostic dilemma, particularly in patients with cancer. We report our experience with meningioma identification on Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET/CT. Patients who underwent PiB PET/CT from 2006 to 2015 were reviewed to identify those with intracranial tumors. Tumor types were classified by MR appearance, or by pathology when available. Maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) measurements of tumor PiB activity were compared across tumor types. 2472 patients underwent PiB PET/CT in the period of interest; 45 patients (1.8%) had probable or definite intracranial tumor. Tumor types were meningioma (29/45, 64%), vestibular schwannoma (7/45, 16%), pituitary macroadenoma (4/45, 9%), metastatic disease (2/45, 4%), and others (3/45, 7%). In patients with meningioma, the mean lesion SUVmax was 2.05 (SD 1.37), versus 1.00 (SD 0.42) in patients with non-meningioma tumors (p < 0.01). A receiver operating curve was created for lesion:cerebellum SUVmax ratio, with an area under the curve of 0.91 for a value of 1.68. At or above this ratio, specificity for meningioma was 100% (95% CI 79-100%) and sensitivity was 76% (95% CI 57-90%). PiB PET activity within an intracranial tumor is a highly specific and reasonably sensitive marker of meningioma. Further prospective evaluation is warranted to validate this result as well as to assess the performance of commercially available beta-amyloid radiotracers in meningioma identification.

29120943|t|Native prion protein homodimers are destabilized by oligomeric amyloid beta 1-42 species as shown by single-molecule imaging.
29120943|a|Prion proteins (PrPc) are receptors for amyloid beta 1-42 (Abeta1-42) oligomers, but we do not know the impact of Abeta1-42 binding to PrPc on the interaction of membrane-bound PrPc with molecules that regulate downstream biological pathways. Stability of the PrPc dimeric complex and subsequent intermolecular interactions with membranous or cytoplasmic molecules are important for physiological functions of PrPc including neuroprotection. The principal aim of this study was to determine whether homodimer lifetime of PrPc is affected by the presence of Abeta1-42 oligomers. Single-molecule imaging analysis was carried out by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy in PrPc-transfected CHO-K1 cells in the absence or presence of characterized Abeta1-42 oligomers. The contribution of different Abeta1-42 oligomer conformations to Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology and to the associated neurotoxicity is unknown. To be precise, with the oligomeric species used in our study, we biochemically analyzed the molecular weight of oligomers formed from Abeta1-42 monomers under our experimental conditions. The lifetime of PrPc homodimers was 210 ms, and in the presence of Abeta1-42 oligomers, the lifetime was significantly reduced (to 92 ms). The reduction of PrPc homodimer lifetime by Abeta1-42 oligomers may impair PrPc-mediated downstream neuroprotective signaling.

29121398|t|Protein phosphatase 2A and tau: an orchestrated 'Pas de Deux'.
29121398|a|The neuronal microtubule-associated protein tau serves a critical role in regulating axonal microtubule dynamics to support neuronal and synaptic functions. Furthermore, it contributes to glutamatergic regulation and synaptic plasticity. Emerging evidence also suggests that tau serves as a signaling scaffold. Tau function and subcellular localization are tightly regulated, in part, by the orchestrated interplay between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events. Significantly, protein phosphatase type 2A (PP2A), encompassing the regulatory PPP2R2A (or Balpha) subunit, is a major brain heterotrimeric enzyme and the primary tau Ser/Thr phosphatase in vivo. Herein, we closely examine how the intimate and compartmentalized interactions between PP2A and tau regulate tau phosphorylation and function, and play an essential role in neuronal homeostasis. We also review evidence supporting a strong link between deregulation of tau-PP2A functional interactions and the molecular underpinnings of various neurodegenerative diseases collectively called tauopathies. Lastly, we discuss the opportunities and associated challenges in more specifically targeting PP2A-tau interactions for drug development for tauopathies.

29122977|t|Abeta inhibits SREBP-2 activation through Akt inhibition.
29122977|a|We previously demonstrated that oligomeric amyloid beta42 (oAbeta42) inhibits the mevalonate pathway impairing cholesterol synthesis and protein prenylation. Enzymes of the mevalonate pathway are regulated by the transcription factor SREBP-2. Here, we show that in several neuronal types challenged with oAbeta42, SREBP-2 activation is reduced. Moreover, SREBP-2 activation is also decreased in the brain cortex of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model, TgCRND8, suggesting that SREBP-2 may be affected in vivo early in the disease. We demonstrate that oAbeta42 does not affect enzymatic cleavage of SREBP-2 per se, but may impair SREBP-2 transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi. Trafficking of SREBP-2 from the ER to the Golgi requires protein kinase B (Akt) activation. oAbeta42 significantly reduces Akt phosphorylation and this decrease is responsible for the decline in SREBP-2 activation. Overexpression of constitutively active Akt prevents the effect of oAbeta42 on SREBP-2 and the downstream inhibition of cholesterol synthesis and protein prenylation. Our work provides a novel mechanistic link between Abeta and the mevalonate pathway, which will impact the views on issues related to cholesterol, isoprenoids, and statins in AD. We also identify SREBP-2 as an indirect target of Akt in neurons, which may play a role in the cross-talk between AD and diabetes.

29125327|t|Obstructive Sleep Apnea Severity Affects Amyloid Burden in Cognitively Normal Elderly. A Longitudinal Study.
29125327|a|RATIONALE: Recent evidence suggests that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may be a risk factor for developing mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. However, how sleep apnea affects longitudinal risk for Alzheimer's disease is less well understood. OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that there is an association between severity of OSA and longitudinal increase in amyloid burden in cognitively normal elderly. METHODS: Data were derived from a 2-year prospective longitudinal study that sampled community-dwelling healthy cognitively normal elderly. Subjects were healthy volunteers between the ages of 55 and 90, were nondepressed, and had a consensus clinical diagnosis of cognitively normal. Cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta was measured using ELISA. Subjects received Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography scans following standardized procedures. Monitoring of OSA was completed using a home sleep recording device. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We found that severity of OSA indices (AHIall [F1,88 = 4.26; P < 0.05] and AHI4% [F1,87 = 4.36; P < 0.05]) were associated with annual rate of change of cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta42 using linear regression after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, and apolipoprotein E4 status. AHIall and AHI4% were not associated with increases in ADPiB-mask (Alzheimer's disease vulnerable regions of interest Pittsburg compound B positron emission tomography mask) most likely because of the small sample size, although there was a trend for AHIall (F1,28 = 2.96, P = 0.09; and F1,28 = 2.32, not significant, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In a sample of cognitively normal elderly, OSA was associated with markers of increased amyloid burden over the 2-year follow-up. Sleep fragmentation and/or intermittent hypoxia from OSA are likely candidate mechanisms. If confirmed, clinical interventions for OSA may be useful in preventing amyloid build-up in cognitively normal elderly.

29127191|t|Dysfunction of different cellular degradation pathways contributes to specific beta-amyloid42-induced pathologies.
29127191|a|The endosomal-lysosomal system (ELS), autophagy, and ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) are cellular degradation pathways that each play a critical role in the removal of misfolded proteins and the prevention of the accumulation of abnormal proteins. Recent studies on Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis have suggested that accumulation of aggregated beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides in the AD brain results from a dysfunction in these cellular clearance systems. However, the specific roles of these pathways in the removal of Abeta peptides and the pathogenesis underlying AD are unclear. Our in vitro and in vivo genetic approaches revealed that ELS mainly removed monomeric beta-amyloid42 (Abeta42), while autophagy and UPS clear oligomeric Abeta42. Although overproduction of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate-5 increased Abeta42 clearance, it reduced the life span of Abeta42 transgenic flies. Our behavioral studies further demonstrated impaired autophagy and UPS-enhanced Abeta42-induced learning and memory deficits, but there was no effect on Abeta42-induced reduction in life span. Results from genetic fluorescence imaging showed that these pathways were damaged in the following order: UPS, autophagy, and finally ELS. The results of our study demonstrate that different degradation pathways play distinct roles in the removal of Abeta42 aggregates and in disease progression. These findings also suggest that pharmacologic treatments that are designed to stimulate cellular degradation pathways in patients with AD should be used with caution.-Ji, X.-R., Cheng, K.-C., Chen, Y.-R., Lin, T.-Y., Cheung, C.

29127203|t|Receptor for advanced glycation end products mediates sepsis-triggered amyloid-beta accumulation, Tau phosphorylation, and cognitive impairment.
29127203|a|Patients recovering from sepsis have higher rates of CNS morbidities associated with long-lasting impairment of cognitive functions, including neurodegenerative diseases. However, the molecular etiology of these sepsis-induced impairments is unclear. Here, we investigated the role of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) in neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration-associated changes, and cognitive dysfunction arising after sepsis recovery. Adult Wistar rats underwent cecal ligation and perforation (CLP), and serum and brain (hippocampus and prefrontal cortex) samples were obtained at days 1, 15, and 30 after the CLP. We examined these samples for systemic and brain inflammation; amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) and Ser-202-phosphorylated Tau (p-TauSer-202) levels; and RAGE, RAGE ligands, and RAGE intracellular signaling. Serum markers associated with the acute proinflammatory phase of sepsis (TNFalpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6) rapidly increased and then progressively decreased during the 30-day period post-CLP, concomitant with a progressive increase in RAGE ligands (S100B, Nepsilon-[carboxymethyl]lysine, HSP70, and HMGB1). In the brain, levels of RAGE and Toll-like receptor 4, glial fibrillary acidic protein and neuronal nitric-oxide synthase, and Abeta and p-TauSer-202 also increased during that time. Of note, intracerebral injection of RAGE antibody into the hippocampus at days 15, 17, and 19 post-CLP reduced Abeta and p-TauSer-202 accumulation, Akt/mechanistic target of rapamycin signaling, levels of ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein, and behavioral deficits associated with cognitive decline. These results indicate that brain RAGE is an essential factor in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders following acute systemic inflammation.

29128930|t|Prognostic value of amyloid PET scan in normal pressure hydrocephalus.
29128930|a|Amyloid positron emission tomography ([18F] florbetaben (FBB) PET) can be used to determine concomitant Alzheimer's disease (AD) in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) patients. FBB PET scans and the tap test were performed in 31 patients with clinically suspected iNPH, and amyloid positive (iNPH/FBB+) and negative (iNPH/FBB-) groups were compared with respect to clinical characteristics. We evaluated prognostic value of FBB PET scans by analyzing the response to the tap test using a linear mixed model. We also performed a multivariable regression analysis to investigate whether amyloid PET positivity can predict the positive tap test response independent of other AD biomarkers. The results showed that the iNPH/FBB+ group (7/31, 22.6%) had a higher percentage of APOE4 carriers, lower Abeta42, higher CSF t-tau, and p-tau/Abeta42 ratio than the iNPH/FBB- group (24/31, 77.4%), while the two groups did not differ in imaging characteristics. The iNPH/FBB- group had a higher percentage of tap responders and showed a greater improvement in gait scores after the tap test than the iNPH/FBB+ group (group-tap test effect interaction, p = 0.035). A multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that amyloid positivity on PET scans (OR 0.03, p = 0.029) and CSF p-tau (OR 0.87, p = 0.044) were independently associated with the positive tap test response. Among 21 tap responders in the iNPH/FBB- group, 14 patients received shunt surgery and 12/14 (85.7%) patients showed symptom improvement. Our findings suggest that amyloid PET scans can help determine which iNPH patients will benefit from shunt surgery by discriminating concomitant AD.

29129405|t|Neurogenesis and morphological-neural alterations closely related to amyloid beta-peptide (25-35)-induced memory impairment in male rats.
29129405|a|Memory impairment by the Amyloid-beta 25-35 (Abeta25-35) peptide in animal models has provided an understanding of the causes behind the similar deterioration that occurs in Alzheimer's disease. However, it is uncertain if a decrease of dendritic spines and neurogenesis conduces to cognitive impairment by an impairment in the retrieval of stored memory. The aim of this study was to evaluate the consequences of impairment on spatial memory caused by the administration of the Abeta25-35 peptide in the hippocampus, which is associated whit morphological changes and neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG). The vehicle or Abeta25-35 peptide (0.1mug/muL) were bilaterally administered in the CA1 subfield of the rat hippocampus. The animals were tested for spatial learning and memory in the Morris Water Maze. In the day's 11, 18 and 32 after administration of the Abeta25-35 peptide were examined the morphological changes in the DG using a Golgi-Cox stain. In the day 32, the neurogenesis was evaluated by the immunoreactivity to 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU; 100mg/kg, i.p.) that corresponding to cellular proliferation post damage, the neuronal specific nuclear protein (NeuN) and doublecortin (DCX). This study found a memory retrieval impairment occurring at day 17, a cognitive deficit which had increased significantly at day 31 after the administration of Abeta25-35 peptide. These results are related to morphological changes in the granular cells of the DG, such as a shorter dendritic length and a decrease in the number of dendritic spines. In neurogenesis, the total number of cells positive to BrdU, NeuN and DCX in the hippocampal granule cell layer was found to have declined in animals treated with Abeta25-35. The results suggest that the Abeta25-35 peptide impairs memory retrieval by decreasing the number of dendritic spines and altering neurogenesis in the DG.

29134678|t|Systemic immune-checkpoint blockade with anti-PD1 antibodies does not alter cerebral amyloid-beta burden in several amyloid transgenic mouse models.
29134678|a|Chronic inflammation represents a central component in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent work suggests that breaking immune tolerance by Programmed cell Death-1 (PD1) checkpoint inhibition produces an IFN-gamma-dependent systemic immune response, with infiltration of the brain by peripheral myeloid cells and neuropathological as well as functional improvements even in mice with advanced amyloid pathology (Baruch et al., (): Nature Medicine, 22:135-137). Immune checkpoint inhibition was therefore suggested as potential treatment for neurodegenerative disorders when activation of the immune system is appropriate. Because a xenogeneic rat antibody (mAb) was used in the study, whether the effect was specific to PD1 target engagement was uncertain. In the present study we examined whether PD1 immunotherapy can lower amyloid-beta pathology in a range of different amyloid transgenic models performed at three pharmaceutical companies with the exact same anti-PD1 isotype and two mouse chimeric variants. Although PD1 immunotherapy stimulated systemic activation of the peripheral immune system, monocyte-derived macrophage infiltration into the brain was not detected, and progression of brain amyloid pathology was not altered. Similar negative results of the effect of PD1 immunotherapy on amyloid brain pathology were obtained in two additional models in two separate institutions. These results show that inhibition of PD1 checkpoint signaling by itself is not sufficient to reduce amyloid pathology and that additional factors might have contributed to previously published results (Baruch et al., (): Nature Medicine, 22:135-137). Until such factors are elucidated, animal model data do not support further evaluation of PD1 checkpoint inhibition as a therapeutic modality for Alzheimer's disease.

29136123|t|Amyloid Network Topology Characterizes the Progression of Alzheimer's Disease During the Predementia Stages.
29136123|a|There is increasing evidence showing that the accumulation of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide into extracellular plaques is a central event in Alzheimer's disease (AD). These abnormalities can be detected as lowered levels of Abeta42 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and are followed by increased amyloid burden on positron emission tomography (PET) several years before the onset of dementia. The aim of this study was to assess amyloid network topology in nondemented individuals with early stage Abeta accumulation, defined as abnormal CSF Abeta42 levels and normal Florbetapir PET (CSF+/PET-), and more advanced Abeta accumulation, defined as both abnormal CSF Abeta42 and Florbetapir PET (CSF+/PET+). The amyloid networks were built using correlations in the mean 18F-florbetapir PET values between 72 brain regions and analyzed using graph theory analyses. Our findings showed an association between early amyloid stages and increased covariance as well as shorter paths between several brain areas that overlapped with the default-mode network (DMN). Moreover, we found that individuals with more advanced amyloid accumulation showed more widespread changes in brain regions both within and outside the DMN. These findings suggest that amyloid network topology could potentially be used to assess disease progression in the predementia stages of AD.

29136781|t|Andrographolide sulfonate improves Alzheimer-associated phenotypes and mitochondrial dysfunction in APP/PS1 transgenic mice.
29136781|a|Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder with Amyloid-beta plaques onset, synaptic damage, and cognitive decline. Abeta deposits cause pathological events including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuron death. In this study, APPswe/PSENDelta9 double transgenic mice model was used to imitate Alzheimer's disease and the effect and possible mechanism of Andrographolide sulfonate were examined. Andrographolide sulfonate was given to the mice for 7 months before the onset of Abeta plaque. Spatial memory test showed that Andrographolide sulfonate treatment prevented cognitive decline. Abeta deposits were not affected while hippocampus and synapse damage was significantly alleviated. Mechanism studies showed that oxidative stress and mitochondrial swelling was reduced after Andrographolide sulfonate administration. These findings suggest that Andrographolide sulfonate, which has been applied in clinical medicine, might be a promising therapeutic agent for AD therapy via mitochondria protection.

29146694|t|Spatiotemporal Distribution of beta-Amyloid in Alzheimer Disease Is the Result of Heterogeneous Regional Carrying Capacities.
29146694|a|beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation in the brain is 1 of 2 pathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer disease (AD), and the spatial distribution of Abeta has been studied extensively ex vivo. Methods: We applied mathematical modeling to Abeta in vivo PET imaging data to investigate competing theories of Abeta spread in AD. Results: Our results provided evidence that Abeta accumulation starts in all brain regions simultaneously and that its spatiotemporal distribution is due to heterogeneous regional carrying capacities (regional maximum possible concentration of Abeta) for the aggregated protein rather than to longer-term spreading from seed regions. Conclusion: The in vivo spatiotemporal distribution of Abeta in AD can be mathematically modeled using a logistic growth model in which the Abeta carrying capacity is heterogeneous across the brain but the exponential growth rate and time of half maximal Abeta concentration are constant.

29149631|t|Prostaglandin J2 promotes O-GlcNAcylation raising APP processing by alpha- and beta-secretases: relevance to Alzheimer's disease.
29149631|a|Regulation of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing by alpha- and beta-secretases is of special interest to Alzheimer's disease (AD), as these proteases prevent or mediate amyloid beta formation, respectively. Neuroinflammation is also implicated in AD. Our data demonstrate that the endogenous mediator of inflammation prostaglandin J2 (PGJ2) promotes full-length APP (FL-APP) processing by alpha- and beta-secretases. The decrease in FL-APP was independent of proteasomal, lysosomal, calpain, caspase, and gamma-secretase activities. Moreover, PGJ2-treatment promoted cleavage of secreted APP, specifically sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta, generated by alpha and beta-secretase, respectively. Notably, PGJ2-treatment induced caspase-dependent cleavage of sAPPbeta. Mechanistically, PGJ2-treatment selectively diminished mature (O- and N-glycosylated) but not immature (N-glycosylated only) FL-APP. PGJ2-treatment also increased the overall levels of protein O-GlcNAcylation, which occurs within the nucleocytoplasmic compartment. It is known that APP undergoes O-GlcNAcylation and that the latter protects proteins from proteasomal degradation. Our results suggest that by increasing protein O-GlcNAcylation levels, PGJ2 renders mature APP less prone to proteasomal degradation, thus shunting APP toward processing by alpha- and beta-secretases.

29154272|t|Differences in Synaptic Dysfunction Between rTg4510 and APP/PS1 Mouse Models of Alzheimer's Disease.
29154272|a|Genetically modified mice have provided insights into the progression and pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we have examined two mouse models of AD: the rTg4510 mouse, which overexpresses mutant human Tau gene, and the APP/PS1 mouse, which overexpresses mutant human genes for amyloid precursor protein and presenilin 1. Both models exhibit deficits in hippocampal function, but comparative analyses of these deficits are sparse. We used extracellular field potential recordings in hippocampal slices to study basal synaptic transmission (BST), paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), and long-term potentiation (LTP) at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 pyramidal cell synapses in both models. We found that 6-7, but not 2-3-month-old rTg4510 mice exhibited reduced pre-synaptic activation (fiber volley (FV) amplitude, ~50%) and field excitatory post-synaptic potential (fEPSP) slope (~40%) compared to wild-type controls. In contrast to previous reports, BST, when controlled for FV amplitude, was not altered in rTg4510. APP/PS1 mice (2-3 mo and 8-10 mo) had unchanged FV amplitude compared to wild-type controls, while fEPSP slope was reduced by ~34% in older mice, indicating a deficit in BST. PPF was unchanged in 8-10-month-old APP/PS1 mice, but was reduced in 6-7-month-old rTg4510 mice. LTP was reduced only in older rTg4510 and APP/PS1 mice. Our data suggest that BST deficits appear earlier in APP/PS1 than in rTg4510, which exhibited no BST deficits at the ages tested. However, FV and synaptic plasticity deficits developed earlier in rTg4510. These findings highlight fundamental differences in the progression of synaptic pathology in two genetically distinct models of AD.

29154284|t|Palmitoylethanolamide Blunts Amyloid-beta42-Induced Astrocyte Activation and Improves Neuronal Survival in Primary Mouse Cortical Astrocyte-Neuron Co-Cultures.
29154284|a|BACKGROUND: Based on the pivotal role of astrocytes in brain homeostasis and the strong metabolic cooperation existing between neurons and astrocytes, it has been suggested that astrocytic dysfunctions might cause and/or contribute to neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative processes. Therapeutic approaches aimed at both neuroprotection and neuroinflammation reduction may prove particularly effective in slowing the progression of these diseases. The endogenous lipid mediator palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) displayed neuroprotective and anti(neuro)inflammatory properties, and demonstrated interesting potential as a novel treatment for Alzheimer's disease. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: We firstly evaluated whether astrocytes could participate in regulating the Abeta42-induced neuronal damage, by using primary mouse astrocytes cell cultures and mixed astrocytes-neurons cultures. Furthermore, the possible protective effects of PEA against Abeta42-induced neuronal toxicity have also been investigated by evaluating neuronal viability, apoptosis, and morphometric parameters. RESULTS: The presence of astrocytes pre-exposed to Abeta42 (0.5muM; 24 h) induced a reduction of neuronal viability in primary mouse astrocytes-neurons co-cultures. Furthermore, under these experimental conditions, an increase in the number of neuronal apoptotic nuclei and a decrease in the number of MAP-2 positive neurons were observed. Finally, astrocytic Abeta42 pre-exposure induced an increase in the number of neurite aggregations/100mum as compared to control (i.e., untreated) astrocytes-neurons co-cultures. These effects were not observed in neurons cultured in the presence of astrocytes pre-exposed to PEA (0.1muM), applied 1 h before and maintained during Abeta42 treatment. CONCLUSION: Astrocytes contribute to Abeta42-induced neurotoxicity and PEA, by blunting Abeta42-induced astrocyte activation, improved neuronal survival in mouse astrocyte-neuron co-cultures.

29154286|t|Clinic-Based Validation of Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers with Florbetapir PET for Diagnosis of Dementia.
29154286|a|BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker studies have shown variable accuracy for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD); therefore, internal validation is recommended. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation between CSF biomarkers and cerebral 18-Florbetapir positron emission tomography (Amyloid-PET) and calculate their sensitivity and specificity to obtain the optimal clinical cut-off points to diagnose the etiology of cognitive impairment. METHODS: We performed Amyloid-PET scans and CSF biomarker levels analyses in 68 subjects (50 with mild cognitive impairment, 11 with AD dementia, and 7 with non-AD dementia). Visual examination of Amyloid-PET scans was performed. CSF analyses were performed using standard sandwich ELISA. RESULTS: Amyloid-PET was positive in 36 subjects, negative in 26, and inconclusive in 6. Optimal clinical cut-off points for CSF markers were the following: amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta42) = 629 pg/ml, total tau (t-tau) = 532 pg/ml, phosphorylated tau (p-tau) = 88 pg/ml, and t-tau/Abeta42 ratio = 0.58. T-tau/Abeta42 ratio showed the best sensitivity and specificity (92 and 84%, respectively). T-tau and p-tau CSF levels (r2 = 0.867) followed by the t-tau and t-tau/Abeta42 CSF ratio (r2 = 0.666) showed the strongest inter-marker correlation. Interestingly, subjects with inconclusive Amyloid-PET showed intermediate values for all CSF markers between negative and positive Amyloid-PET groups. CONCLUSIONS: CSF t-tau/Abeta42 ratio appears to be the most accurate AD CSF marker. The presence of intermediate values for CSF markers among the subjects with inconclusive Amyloid-PET suggests the presence of other dementias associated with AD pathology or intermediate phenotypes.

29154819|t|Abeta1-42 induces cell damage via RAGE-dependent endoplasmic reticulum stress in bEnd.3 cells.
29154819|a|Blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown has been determined to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the underlying mechanisms of BBB disruption in AD remain unclear. Our previous study suggested that the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) functioned as a signal transduction receptor in Abeta1-42-induced damage in endothelial cells. In our present study, we revealed that RAGE-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) is essential for Abeta-induced endothelial cell damage. Here, we found that Abeta1-42 activated ERS by upregulation of Grp78, xbp-1 and CHOP in endothelial cells and that Abeta1-42-resulted lesions, including the upregulations of caspase-12 and caspase-3, the augment of bax/bcl-2 ratio, and the downregulations of ZO-1 and Occludin in bEnd.3 cells, were ameliorated by the pretreatment of salubrinal, an ERS inhibitor. Furthermore, the expressions of Grp78, xbp-1 and CHOP induced by Abeta1-42 were blocked by transfection of RAGE small interfering RNA (siRNA), which indicated that Abeta1-42 activated ERS in a RAGE-dependent manner. Additionally, bEnd.3 cells transfected with RAGE siRNA showed lower expressions of caspase-12 and caspase-3, decreased bax/bcl-2 ratio, and higher expressions of ZO-1 and Occludin following Abeta1-42 treatment, comparing to control cells. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that Abeta1-42 induced endothelial cells damage via activation of ERS in a RAGE-dependent manner.

29154879|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the most common type of dementia in elderly ( >65years of age). Excessive extra cellular deposits of amyloid beta (Abeta) are a pathological feature of AD. Abeta can cause cell death through oxidative damage; recent studies have implicated opening of mPTP as a detrimental event in AD-related mitochondrial dysfunctions. Over the past few years, natural compounds with antioxidant properties have shown promise for intervention in AD.

29155576|t|Chronic Arsenic Exposure Increases Abeta(1-42) Production and Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products Expression in Rat Brain.
29155576|a|Chronic arsenic exposure during development is associated with alterations of chemical transmission and demyelination, which result in cognitive deficits and peripheral neuropathies. At the cellular level, arsenic toxicity involves increased generation of reactive species that induce severe cellular alterations such as DNA fragmentation, apoptosis, and lipid peroxidation. It has been proposed that arsenic-associated neurodegeneration could evolve to Alzheimer disease in later life.1,2 In this study, the effects of chronic exposure to inorganic arsenic (3 ppm by drinking water) in Wistar rats on the production and elimination of Amyloid-beta (Abeta) were evaluated. Male Wistar rats were exposed to 3 ppm of arsenic in drinking water from fetal development until 4 months of age. After behavioral deficits induced by arsenic exposure through contextual fear conditioning were verified, the brains were collected for the determination of total arsenic by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, the levels of amyloid precursor protein and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) by Western blot analysis as well as their transcript levels by RT-qPCR, Abeta(1-42) estimation by ELISA assay and the enzymatic activity of beta-secretase (BACE1). Our results demonstrate that chronic arsenic exposure induces behavioral deficits accompanied of higher levels of soluble and membranal RAGE and the increase of Abeta(1-42) cleaved. In addition, BACE1 enzymatic activity was increased, while immunoblot assays showed no differences in the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) receptor among groups. These results provide evidence of the effects of arsenic exposure on the production of Abeta(1-42) and cerebral amyloid clearance through RAGE in an in vivo model that displays behavioral alterations. This work supports the hypothesis that early exposure to metals may contribute to neurodegeneration associated with amyloid accumulation.

29155947|t|Dementia After Moderate-Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: Coexistence of Multiple Proteinopathies.
29155947|a|We report the clinical, neuroimaging, and neuropathologic characteristics of 2 patients who developed early onset dementia after a moderate-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Neuropathological evaluation revealed abundant beta-amyloid neuritic and cored plaques, diffuse beta-amyloid plaques, and frequent hyperphosphorylated-tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) involving much of the cortex, including insula and mammillary bodies in both cases. Case 1 additionally showed NFTs in both the superficial and deep cortical layers, occasional perivascular and depth-of-sulci NFTs, and parietal white matter rarefaction, which corresponded with decreased parietal fiber tracts observed on ex vivo MRI. Case 2 additionally showed NFT predominance in the superficial layers of the cortex, hypothalamus and brainstem, diffuse Lewy bodies in the cortex, amygdala and brainstem, and intraneuronal TDP-43 inclusions. The neuropathologic diagnoses were atypical Alzheimer disease (AD) with features of chronic traumatic encephalopathy and white matter loss (Case 1), and atypical AD, dementia with Lewy bodies and coexistent TDP-43 pathology (Case 2). These findings support an epidemiological association between TBI and dementia and further characterize the variety of misfolded proteins that may accumulate after TBI. Analyses with comprehensive clinical, imaging, genetic, and neuropathological data are required to characterize the full clinicopathological spectrum associated with dementias occurring after moderate-severe TBI.

29156222|t|Cerebral small vessel disease in middle age and genetic predisposition to late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
29156222|a|INTRODUCTION: Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) and might contribute to the relationship between apolipoprotein E epsilon4 (APOE epsilon4) and LOAD, in older people. However, it is unclear whether CSVD begins in middle age in individuals genetically predisposed to LOAD. METHODS: We assessed the relationship between radiological markers of CSVD, white matter hyperintensities and microbleeds, and genetic predisposition to LOAD in a cross-sectional analysis of cognitively normal subjects aged 40-59 years recruited from the PREVENT Dementia study. RESULTS: Microbleed prevalence was 14.5%, and mean +- standard deviation white matter hyperintensity percentage of total brain volume was 0.41 +- 0.28%. There was no significant association between APOE epsilon4 carrier status or history of parental dementia and white matter hyperintensity volume (P = .713, .912 respectively) or microbleeds (P = .082, .562 respectively) on multiple regression. DISCUSSION: Genetic predisposition to LOAD, through APOE genotype or AD family history, is not associated with CSVD in middle age.

29156223|t|Exploring APOE genotype effects on Alzheimer's disease risk and amyloid beta burden in individuals with subjective cognitive decline: The FundacioACE Healthy Brain Initiative (FACEHBI) study baseline results.
29156223|a|INTRODUCTION: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) has been proposed as a potential preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nevertheless, the genetic and biomarker profiles of SCD individuals remain mostly unexplored. METHODS: We evaluated apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4's effect in the risk of presenting SCD, using the Fundacio ACE Healthy Brain Initiative (FACEHBI) SCD cohort and Spanish controls, and performed a meta-analysis addressing the same question. We assessed the relationship between APOE dosage and brain amyloid burden in the FACEHBI SCD and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohorts. RESULTS: Analysis of the FACEHBI cohort and the meta-analysis demonstrated SCD individuals presented higher allelic frequencies of APOE epsilon4 with respect to controls. APOE dosage explained 9% (FACEHBI cohort) and 11% (FACEHBI and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohorts) of the variance of cerebral amyloid levels. DISCUSSION: The FACEHBI sample presents APOE epsilon4 enrichment, suggesting that a pool of AD patients is nested in our sample. Cerebral amyloid levels are partially explained by the APOE allele dosage, suggesting that other genetic or epigenetic factors are involved in this AD endophenotype.

29161514|t|Discovery of an Orally Bioavailable Benzofuran Analogue That Serves as a beta-Amyloid Aggregation Inhibitor for the Potential Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.
29161514|a|We developed an orally active and blood-brain-barrier-permeable benzofuran analogue (8, MDR-1339) with potent antiaggregation activity. Compound 8 restored cellular viability from Abeta-induced cytotoxicity but also improved the learning and memory function of AD model mice by reducing the Abeta aggregates in the brains. Given the high bioavailability and brain permeability demonstrated in our pharmacokinetic studies, 8 will provide a novel scaffold for an Abeta-aggregation inhibitor that may offer an alternative treatment for AD.

29164610|t|Shared pathological pathways of Alzheimer's disease with specific comorbidities: current perspectives and interventions.
29164610|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) belongs to one of the most multifactorial, complex and heterogeneous morbidity-leading disorders. Despite the extensive research in the field, AD pathogenesis is still at some extend obscure. Mechanisms linking AD with certain comorbidities, namely diabetes mellitus, obesity and dyslipidemia, are increasingly gaining importance, mainly because of their potential role in promoting AD development and exacerbation. Their exact cognitive impairment trajectories, however, remain to be fully elucidated. The current review aims to offer a clear and comprehensive description of the state-of-the-art approaches focused on generating in-depth knowledge regarding the overlapping pathology of AD and its concomitant ailments. Thorough understanding of associated alterations on a number of molecular, metabolic and hormonal pathways, will contribute to the further development of novel and integrated theranostics, as well as targeted interventions that may be beneficial for individuals with age-related cognitive decline.

29164616|t|Protection against beta-amyloid neurotoxicity by a non-toxic endogenous N-terminal beta-amyloid fragment and its active hexapeptide core sequence.
29164616|a|High levels (muM) of beta amyloid (Abeta) oligomers are known to trigger neurotoxic effects, leading to synaptic impairment, behavioral deficits, and apoptotic cell death. The hydrophobic C-terminal domain of Abeta, together with sequences critical for oligomer formation, is essential for this neurotoxicity. However, Abeta at low levels (pM-nM) has been shown to function as a positive neuromodulator and this activity resides in the hydrophilic N-terminal domain of Abeta. An N-terminal Abeta fragment (1-15/16), found in cerebrospinal fluid, was also shown to be a highly active neuromodulator and to reverse Abeta-induced impairments of long-term potentiation. Here, we show the impact of this N-terminal Abeta fragment and a shorter hexapeptide core sequence in the Abeta fragment (Abetacore: 10-15) to protect or reverse Abeta-induced neuronal toxicity, fear memory deficits and apoptotic death. The neuroprotective effects of the N-terminal Abeta fragment and Abetacore on Abeta-induced changes in mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and apoptotic neuronal death were demonstrated via mitochondrial membrane potential, live reactive oxygen species, DNA fragmentation and cell survival assays using a model neuroblastoma cell line (differentiated NG108-15) and mouse hippocampal neuron cultures. The protective action of the N-terminal Abeta fragment and Abetacore against spatial memory processing deficits in amyloid precursor protein/PSEN1 (5XFAD) mice was demonstrated in contextual fear conditioning. Stabilized derivatives of the N-terminal Abetacore were also shown to be fully protective against Abeta-triggered oxidative stress. Together, these findings indicate an endogenous neuroprotective role for the N-terminal Abeta fragment, while active stabilized N-terminal Abetacore derivatives offer the potential for therapeutic application.

29164798|t|Regionally specific changes in the hippocampal circuitry accompany progression of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in preclinical Alzheimer's disease.
29164798|a|Neuropathological and in vivo brain imaging studies agree that the cornu ammonis 1 and subiculum subfields of the hippocampus are most vulnerable to atrophy in the prodromal phases of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, there has been limited investigation of the structural integrity of the components of the hippocampal circuit, including subfields and extra-hippocampal white matter structure, in relation to the progression of well-accepted cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD, amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta) and total-tau (tau). We investigated these relationships in 88 aging asymptomatic individuals with a parental or multiple-sibling familial history of AD. Apolipoprotein (APOE) e4 risk allele carriers were identified, and all participants underwent cognitive testing, structural magnetic resonance imaging, and lumbar puncture for CSF assays of tau, phosphorylated-tau (p-tau) and Abeta. Individuals with a reduction in CSF Abeta levels (an indicator of amyloid accretion into neuritic plaques) as well as evident tau pathology (believed to be linked to neurodegeneration) exhibited lower subiculum volume, lower fornix microstructural integrity, and a trend towards lower cognitive score than individuals who showed only reduction in CSF Abeta. In contrast, persons with normal levels of tau showed an increase in structural MR markers in relation to declining levels of CSF Abeta. These results suggest that hippocampal subfield volume and extra-hippocampal white matter microstructure demonstrate a complex pattern where an initial volume increase is followed by decline among asymptomatic individuals who, in some instances, may be a decade or more away from onset of cognitive or functional impairment.

29168583|t|Distinct patterns of amyloid-dependent tau accumulation in Lewy body diseases.
29168583|a|BACKGROUND: In addition to Lewy body pathology, amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that are characteristic for Alzheimer's disease are also frequently found in Lewy body diseases. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to investigate tau accumulation patterns in dementia with Lewy bodies and other Lewy body diseases using in vivo 18 F-AV-1451 PET. METHODS: The study included 12 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with normal cognition, 22 PD patients with cognitive impairment, and 18 dementia with Lewy bodies patients. In addition, 25 Alzheimer's disease patients and 25 healthy controls were included for comparison. All participants underwent 18 F-AV-1451 and 18 F-florbetaben PET scans, and cortical binding values were compared between the controls and each disease group. RESULTS: When compared with the controls, dementia with Lewy bodies patients showed slightly increased 18 F-AV-1451 binding in the primary sensorimotor and visual cortices and the parieto-temporal cortices, which failed to survive multiple comparisons. Amyloid-positive dementia with Lewy bodies patients showed significantly increased binding in the same regions when compared with controls, and even greater binding in the primary sensorimotor and visual cortices than Alzheimer's disease. Meanwhile, binding in the lateral and medial temporal cortices was less prominent than in Alzheimer's disease. In dementia with Lewy bodies, 18 F-AV-1451 binding in the occipital cortex correlated with 18 F-florbetaben binding. Amyloid-negative patients with normal cognition, patients with cognitive impairment, and dementia with Lewy bodies patients did not show increased 18 F-AV-1451 binding. CONCLUSIONS: Dementia with Lewy bodies patients may harbor 18 F-AV-1451 binding patterns distinct from Alzheimer's disease, with greater involvement of the primary cortices and less involvement of the temporal cortex. Tau burden increases in the Lewy body disease spectrum, and amyloid may play an important role in the accumulation of neocortical tau in Lewy body diseases.   2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

29171991|t|Concordance Between Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers with Alzheimer's Disease Pathology Between Three Independent Assay Platforms.
29171991|a|BACKGROUND: To enhance the accuracy of clinical diagnosis for Alzheimer's disease (AD), pre-mortem biomarkers have become increasingly important for diagnosis and for participant recruitment in disease-specific treatment trials. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers provide a low-cost alternative to positron emission tomography (PET) imaging for in vivo quantification of different AD pathological hallmarks in the brains of affected subjects; however, consensus around the best platform, most informative biomarker and correlations across different methodologies are controversial. OBJECTIVE: Assessing levels of Abeta-amyloid and tau species determined using three different versions of immunoassays, the current study explored the ability of CSF biomarkers to predict PET Abeta-amyloid (32 Abeta-amyloid-and 45 Abeta-amyloid+), as well as concordance between CSF biomarker levels and PET Abeta-amyloid imaging. METHODS: Prediction and concordance analyses were performed using a sub-cohort of 77 individuals (48 healthy controls, 15 with mild cognitive impairment, and 14 with AD) from the Australian Imaging Biomarker and Lifestyle study of aging. RESULTS: Across all three platforms, the T-tau/Abeta42 ratio biomarker had modestly higher correlation with SUVR/BeCKeT (rho= 0.69-0.8) as compared with Abeta42 alone (rho= 0.66-0.75). Differences in CSF biomarker levels between the PET Abeta-amyloid-and Abeta-amyloid+ groups were strongest for the Abeta42/Abeta40 and T-tau/Abeta42 ratios (p < 0.0001); however, comparison of predictive models for PET Abeta-amyloid showed no difference between Abeta42 alone and the T-tau/Abeta42 ratio. CONCLUSION: This study confirms strong concordance between CSF biomarkers and PET Abeta-amyloid status is independent of immunoassay platform, supporting their utility as biomarkers in clinical practice for the diagnosis of AD and for participant enrichment in clinical trials.

29171996|t|Cerebrospinal Fluid C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 2 Correlates with Brain Atrophy and Cognitive Impairment in Alzheimer's Disease.
29171996|a|BACKGROUND: Chronic neuroinflammation has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between cytokine and anti-amyloid-beta (Abeta) autoantibody levels and the degree of brain atrophy and cognitive impairment in AD patients. METHODS: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10, interleukin 6, and anti-Abeta autoantibody were evaluated in 69 AD patients. Serum levels of CCL2 and anti-Abeta autoantibody were also examined. The degree of brain atrophy was assessed using the voxel-based specific regional analysis system for AD, which targets the volumes of interest (VOI) in medial temporal structures. Cognitive function was evaluated by neuropsychological testing, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB). RESULTS: CSF CCL2 levels correlated significantly with the severity (p = 0.023) and the extent (p = 0.022) of VOI atrophy, and with the extent of gray matter atrophy (p = 0.039) in AD patients. CSF anti-Abeta autoantibody levels were inversely correlated with the severity of VOI atrophy (p = 0.020), the extent of VOI atrophy (p = 0.015), and the ratio of VOI/GM atrophy (r = -0.358, p = 0.004). CSF CCL2 levels were also inversely correlated with MMSE (p = 0.0497) and FAB scores (p = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: CSF CCL2 levels are associated with the degree of medial temporal lobe and gray matter atrophy, and cognitive decline in AD.

29172101|t|Design, synthesis and evaluation of resveratrol-indazole hybrids as novel monoamine oxidases inhibitors with amyloid-beta aggregation inhibition.
29172101|a|Novel hybrids with MAO and Abeta (1-42) self-aggregation inhibitory activities were designed and synthesized with the employment of indazole moiety and resveratrol. The biological screening results indicated that most compounds displayed potent inhibitory activity for Abeta (1-42) self-aggregation, and obvious selective inhibition to MAO-B. Among these compounds, compound 6e was the most potent inhibitor not only for hMAO-B (IC50 = 1.14 muM) but also for Abeta (1-42) self-aggregation (58.9% at 20 muM). Molecular modeling and kinetic studies revealed that compound 6e was a competitive MAO-B inhibitor, which can occupy the active site of MAO-B, and interact with Abeta (1-42) via pi-pi and cation-pi stacking interactions. In addition, compound 6e had no toxicity on PC12 cells and could cross the BBB. Collectively, all these results suggested that compound 6e might be a promising multi-target lead compound worthy of further investigation.

29175122|t|Effect of saturation in phospholipid/fatty acid monolayers on interaction with amyloid beta peptide.
29175122|a|The effect of the saturation of fatty acid (FA) in 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocoline (DMPC)/FA membrane on the interaction between lipid membrane and amyloid beta monomer was investigated by using the Langmuir monolayer technique. The surface pressure (Pi)-mean molecular area (A) isotherms and fluorescent measurements reveal that DMPC and octadecanoic acid (stearic acid, SA) molecules were somewhat miscible in the mixed membrane, which was maintained to homogeneous gel phase by enhance of the intermolecular hydrophobic interactions because of the all trans acyl chains. On the other hand, DMPC and 9Z,12Z-octadecadienoic acid (linoleic acid, LA) molecules were considered to be well miscible in the mixed membrane, where the membrane partially transferred from gel phase to liquid-crystalline phase. The Pi-A isotherms of the monolayers on amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) solution indicated that Abeta monomers tend to be inserted into the saturated acyl chain region of monolayers at low surface pressure and that the Abeta monomers were then extruded from the monolayer at higher surface pressure. It was observed that behaviors of Abeta monomers at higher surface pressure depended on membrane microstructures. In the DMPC/SA monolayers, Abeta aggregated and then was extruded from monolayers at about 20 mN m-1 of surface pressure irrespective of the SA proportion. On the other hand, in the DMPC/LA monolayers, Abeta, which favors to interact with DMPC, is dispersed in the monolayer even at high surface pressure because DMPC and LA molecules were well miscible in the monolayer.

29177679|t|Polygenic hazard score: an enrichment marker for Alzheimer's associated amyloid and tau deposition.
29177679|a|There is an urgent need for identifying nondemented individuals at the highest risk of progressing to Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. Here, we evaluated whether a recently validated polygenic hazard score (PHS) can be integrated with known in vivo cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or positron emission tomography (PET) biomarkers of amyloid, and CSF tau pathology to prospectively predict cognitive and clinical decline in 347 cognitive normal (CN; baseline age range = 59.7-90.1, 98.85% white) and 599 mild cognitively impaired (MCI; baseline age range = 54.4-91.4, 98.83% white) individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1, GO, and 2. We further investigated the association of PHS with post-mortem amyloid load and neurofibrillary tangles in the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) cohort (N = 485, age at death range = 71.3-108.3). In CN and MCI individuals, we found that amyloid and total tau positivity systematically varies as a function of PHS. For individuals in greater than the 50th percentile PHS, the positive predictive value for amyloid approached 100%; for individuals in less than the 25th percentile PHS, the negative predictive value for total tau approached 85%. High PHS individuals with amyloid and tau pathology showed the steepest longitudinal cognitive and clinical decline, even among APOE epsilon4 noncarriers. Among the CN subgroup, we similarly found that PHS was strongly associated with amyloid positivity and the combination of PHS and biomarker status significantly predicted longitudinal clinical progression. In the ROSMAP cohort, higher PHS was associated with higher post-mortem amyloid load and neurofibrillary tangles, even in APOE epsilon4 noncarriers. Together, our results show that even after accounting for APOE epsilon4 effects, PHS may be useful in MCI and preclinical AD therapeutic trials to enrich for biomarker-positive individuals at highest risk for short-term clinical progression.

29192126|t|Entorhinal Tau Pathology, Episodic Memory Decline, and Neurodegeneration in Aging.
29192126|a|The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is an early site of tau accumulation and MTL dysfunction may underlie episodic-memory decline in aging and dementia. Postmortem data indicate that tau pathology in the transentorhinal cortex is common by age 60, whereas spread to neocortical regions and worsening of cognition is associated with beta-amyloid (Abeta). We used [18F]AV-1451 and [11C]PiB positron emission tomography, structural MRI, and neuropsychological assessment to investigate how in vivo tau accumulation in temporal lobe regions, Abeta, and MTL atrophy contribute to episodic memory in cognitively normal older adults (n = 83; age, 77 +- 6 years; 58% female). Stepwise regressions identified tau in MTL regions known to be affected in old age as the best predictor of episodic-memory performance independent of Abeta status. There was no interactive effect of MTL tau with Abeta on memory. Higher MTL tau was related to higher age in the subjects without evidence of Abeta. Among temporal lobe subregions, episodic memory was most strongly related to tau-tracer uptake in the parahippocampal gyrus, particularly the posterior entorhinal cortex, which in our parcellation includes the transentorhinal cortex. In subjects with longitudinal MRI and cognitive data (n = 57), entorhinal atrophy mirrored patterns of tau pathology and their relationship with memory decline. Our data are consistent with neuropathological studies and further suggest that entorhinal tau pathology underlies memory decline in old age even without Abeta.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Tau tangles and beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques are key lesions in Alzheimer's disease (AD) but both pathologies also occur in cognitively normal older people. Neuropathological data indicate that tau tangles in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) underlie episodic-memory impairments in AD dementia. However, it remains unclear whether MTL tau pathology also accounts for memory impairments often seen in elderly people and how Abeta affects this relationship. Using tau-specific and Abeta-specific positron emission tomography tracers, we show that in vivo MTL tau pathology is associated with episodic-memory performance and MTL atrophy in cognitively normal adults, independent of Abeta. Our data point to MTL tau pathology, particularly in the entorhinal cortex, as a substrate of age-related episodic-memory loss.

29195093|t|Synthesis of derivatives of cleistopholine and their anti-acetylcholinesterase and anti-beta-amyloid aggregation activity.
29195093|a|A series of 6- and 9-substituted cleistopholine derivatives has been designed, synthesized and investigated to inhibit the aggregation of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and beta-myloid (A beta). Results showed that these synthetic compounds had excellent AChE inhibitory activity and a significant in vitro inhibitory potency toward the self-induced A beta aggregation. When SH-SY5Y cells were treated with these substituted cleistopholine derivatives during they overexpressed the Swedish mutant form of human beta -amyloid precursor protein (APPsw), A beta 42 secretion levels were significantly reduced. According to a parallel artificial membrane permeation assay for BBB, seven out of these sixteen synthetic compounds probably could cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to reach their targets in the central nervous system (CNS).

29196581|t|Increased midlife triglycerides predict brain beta-amyloid and tau pathology 20 years later.
29196581|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of midlife lipid levels on Alzheimer brain pathology 20 years later in cognitively normal elderly individuals. METHODS: This is a longitudinal cohort study of 318 cognitively normal individuals with data on fasting lipid levels at midlife (mean age 54 years). Presence of beta-amyloid (Abeta) and tau pathologies 20 years later (mean age 73 years) were detected by quantifying Alzheimer disease (AD) biomarkers in CSF. In a subset (n = 134), Abeta (18F-flutemetamol) PET was also performed. RESULTS: CSF Abeta42 and Abeta PET revealed Abeta pathology in approximately 20% of the cognitively healthy population and CSF Abeta42/phosphorylated tau (p-tau) ratio indicated both Abeta and tau pathology in 16%. Higher levels of triglycerides in midlife were independently associated with abnormal CSF Abeta42 (odds ratio [OR] 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.75, p = 0.029) and abnormal Abeta42/p-tau ratio (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.10-1.93; p = 0.009) adjusting for age, sex, APOE epsilon4, education, and multiple vascular risk factors. Triglycerides were also associated with abnormal Abeta PET in multivariable regression models, but the association was attenuated in the fully adjusted model. Increased levels of medium and large low-density lipoprotein subfractions were significantly associated with abnormal Abeta PET and large high-density lipoprotein particles were associated with decreased risk of abnormal Abeta PET. CONCLUSIONS: Increased levels of triglycerides at midlife predict brain Abeta and tau pathology 20 years later in cognitively healthy individuals. Certain lipoprotein subfractions may also be risk factors for Abeta pathology. These findings further support an involvement of lipids in the very early stages of AD development.

29200205|t|Amyloid-beta plaques enhance Alzheimer's brain tau-seeded pathologies by facilitating neuritic plaque tau aggregation.
29200205|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and intracellular tau inclusions. However, the exact mechanistic link between these two AD lesions remains enigmatic. Through injection of human AD-brain-derived pathological tau (AD-tau) into Abeta plaque-bearing mouse models that do not overexpress tau, we recapitulated the formation of three major types of AD-relevant tau pathologies: tau aggregates in dystrophic neurites surrounding Abeta plaques (NP tau), AD-like neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neuropil threads (NTs). These distinct tau pathologies have different temporal onsets and functional consequences on neural activity and behavior. Notably, we found that Abeta plaques created a unique environment that facilitated the rapid amplification of proteopathic AD-tau seeds into large tau aggregates, initially appearing as NP tau, which was followed by the formation and spread of NFTs and NTs, likely through secondary seeding events. Our study provides insights into a new multistep mechanism underlying Abeta plaque-associated tau pathogenesis.

29203090|t|Regional patterns of gray matter volume, hypometabolism, and beta-amyloid in groups at risk of Alzheimer's disease.
29203090|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition and neurodegeneration. To seek for signs of such pathologies, we compared regional biomarker degrees and patterns of Abeta deposition, glucose hypometabolism, and gray matter volume (GMV) reduction in 3 groups at risk of AD. In elderly carriers of the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 (APOE4, n = 17), patients with subjective cognitive decline (n = 16), and patients with mild cognitive impairment (n = 30), head-to-head intermodality comparisons were performed on cross-sectional structural magnetic resonance images as well as 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and 18F-florbetapir positron emission tomography scans. In mild cognitive impairment patients, 3 distinct biomarker patterns were recovered, similarly seen in AD patients: (1) in medial temporal regions, local GMV reduction exceeded hypometabolism, (2) in temporoparietal regions, hypometabolism predominated over GMV reduction, and (3) in frontal regions, Abeta deposition exceeded GMV reduction and hypometabolism. In subjective cognitive decline patients, only pattern 1 was detected, while APOE4 carriers demonstrated only pattern 3. Our findings highlight that regional AD-like biomarker patterns may vary across different at-risk populations, potentially reflecting differential mediators of these risks.

29203442|t|N-3 PUFA diet enrichment prevents amyloid beta-induced depressive-like phenotype.
29203442|a|Among neuropsychiatric diseases, depression is one of the most prevalent. Many pathologies have been indicated as comorbid with depression and in particular, neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's diseases (AD). In this regard, several evidences endorse a strong relationship between depression and AD, so much that this mental illness has been proposed either as a risk factor for AD or as a prodromic AD phase. Furthermore, amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide, the main constituent of amyloid plaques commonly considered the principal hallmark of AD brains, has been shown to be increased, in its soluble form, in depressed patients. Accordingly, we have previously found that Abeta, intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) injected, is able to evoke a depressive-like profile in rats accompanied by low cortical serotonin and reduced neurotrophin content. Taking into account the great increase in AD and depression prevalence, many environmental factors have been under study, particularly dietary factors, and the role of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is becoming central in this field of research. Thus, aim of the present study was to evaluate the neurobehavioral effects of lifelong exposure to either n-3 PUFA rich or n-3 PUFA poor diet after Abeta central administration. Results showed that n-3 PUFA enriched diet prevented the Abeta- induced depressive-like behaviors, as reveled by the reduction in the immobility time in the FST test. Furthermore, n-3 PUFA rich diet exposure reverted also serotonin and neurotrophin level reduction in prefrontal cortex of Abeta treated rats. Taken together, our data support the concept that supplementation of diet with n-3 PUFA represents a valid approach to reduce the risk of developing depressive symptoms, as well as reducing the risk of Abeta-related pathologies, such as AD.

29206067|t|Oligomeric and fibrillar amyloid beta 42 induce platelet aggregation partially through GPVI.
29206067|a|The effects of the Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides on platelet aggregation have been previously assessed, but most of these studies focused on Abeta40 species. It also remains to be determined which distinct forms of Abeta peptides exert differential effects on platelets. In AD, oligomeric Abeta42 species is widely thought to be a major contributor to the disease pathogenesis. We, therefore, examine the ability of oligomeric and fibrillary Abeta42 to affect platelet aggregation. We show that both forms of Abeta42 induced significant platelet aggregation and that it is a novel ligand for the platelet receptor GPVI. Furthermore, a novel binding peptide that reduces the formation of soluble Abeta42 oligomers was effective at preventing Abeta42-dependent platelet aggregation. These results support a role for Abeta42 oligomers in platelet hyperactivity.

29208658|t|Unbiased Approach to Counteract Upward Drift in Cerebrospinal Fluid Amyloid-beta 1-42 Analysis Results.
29208658|a|BACKGROUND: Low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta 1-42) concentrations indicate amyloid plaque accumulation in the brain, a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD). Innotest assay values of Abeta 1-42 have gradually increased over the past 2 decades, which might lead to misclassification of AD when a single cutpoint for abnormality is used. We propose an unbiased approach to statistically correct for drift. METHODS: We determined year-specific cutpoints with Gaussian mixture modeling, based on the cross-section of bimodal distributions of Abeta 1-42 concentrations in 4397 memory clinic patients. This allowed us to realign year-specific cutpoints as an unbiased method to remove drift from the data. Sensitivity and specificity to detect AD dementia were compared between corrected and uncorrected values. RESULTS: Abeta 1-42 values increased 22 pg/mL annually, and this could not be explained by changes in cohort composition. Our approach removed time dependencies [beta (SE) = 0.07 (0.59); P = 0.91]. Statistically correcting for drift improved the sensitivity to detect AD dementia to 0.90 (95% CI, 0.89-0.92) from at least 0.66 (95% CI, 0.64-0.69) based on uncorrected data. Specificity became lower (0.69; 95% CI, 0.67-0.70) vs at most 0.80 (95% CI, 0.79-0.82) for uncorrected data. CONCLUSIONS: This approach may also be useful to standardize Abeta 1-42 CSF concentrations across different centers and/or platforms, and to optimize use of CSF biomarker data collected over a long period.

29217584|t|Aging and neurodegeneration are associated with increased mutations in single human neurons.
29217584|a|It has long been hypothesized that aging and neurodegeneration are associated with somatic mutation in neurons; however, methodological hurdles have prevented testing this hypothesis directly. We used single-cell whole-genome sequencing to perform genome-wide somatic single-nucleotide variant (sSNV) identification on DNA from 161 single neurons from the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of 15 normal individuals (aged 4 months to 82 years), as well as 9 individuals affected by early-onset neurodegeneration due to genetic disorders of DNA repair (Cockayne syndrome and xeroderma pigmentosum). sSNVs increased approximately linearly with age in both areas (with a higher rate in hippocampus) and were more abundant in neurodegenerative disease. The accumulation of somatic mutations with age-which we term genosenium-shows age-related, region-related, and disease-related molecular signatures and may be important in other human age-associated conditions.

29220175|t|Spectroscopic Signature for Stable beta-Amyloid Fibrils versus beta-Sheet-Rich Oligomers.
29220175|a|We use two-dimensional IR (2D IR) spectroscopy to explore fibril formation for the two predominant isoforms of the beta-amyloid (Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42) protein associated with Alzheimer's disease. Two-dimensional IR spectra resolve a transition at 1610 cm-1 in Abeta fibrils that does not appear in other Abeta aggregates, even those with predominantly beta-sheet-structure-like oligomers. This transition is not resolved in linear IR spectroscopy because it lies under the broad band centered at 1625 cm-1, which is the traditional infrared signature for amyloid fibrils. The feature is prominent in 2D IR spectra because 2D lineshapes are narrower and scale nonlinearly with transition dipole strengths. Transmission electron microscopy measurements demonstrate that the 1610 cm-1 band is a positive identification of amyloid fibrils. Sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles that solubilize and disaggregate preaggregated Abeta samples deplete the 1625 cm-1 band but do not affect the 1610 cm-1 band, demonstrating that the 1610 cm-1 band is due to very stable fibrils. We demonstrate that the 1610 cm-1 transition arises from amide I modes by mutating out the only side-chain residue that could give rise to this transition, and we explore the potential structural origins of the transition by simulating 2D IR spectra based on Abeta crystal structures. It was not previously possible to distinguish stable Abeta fibrils from the less stable beta-sheet-rich oligomers with infrared light. This 2D IR signature will be useful for Alzheimer's research on Abeta aggregation, fibril formation, and toxicity.

29220873|t|Effect of sleep on overnight cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta kinetics.
29220873|a|Sleep disturbances are associated with future risk of Alzheimer disease. Disrupted sleep increases soluble amyloid beta, suggesting a mechanism for sleep disturbances to increase Alzheimer disease risk. We tested this response in humans using indwelling lumbar catheters to serially sample cerebrospinal fluid while participants were sleep-deprived, treated with sodium oxybate, or allowed to sleep normally. All participants were infused with 13 C6 -leucine to measure amyloid beta kinetics. We found that sleep deprivation increased overnight amyloid beta38, amyloid beta40, and amyloid beta42 levels by 25 to 30% via increased overnight amyloid beta production relative to sleeping controls. These findings suggest that disrupted sleep increases Alzheimer disease risk via increased amyloid beta production. Ann Neurol 2018;83:197-204.

29224965|t|Concerted action of dipeptidyl peptidase IV and glutaminyl cyclase results in formation of pyroglutamate-modified amyloid peptides in vitro.
29224965|a|Compelling evidence suggests a crucial role of amyloid beta peptides (Abeta(1-40/42)) in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The N-terminal truncation of Abeta(1-40/42) and their modification, e.g. by glutaminyl cyclase (QC), is expected to enhance the amyloid toxicity. In this work, the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry application proved N-terminal cleavage of Abeta(1-40/42) by purified dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) in vitro observed earlier. The subsequent transformation of resulted Abeta(3-40/42) to pE-Abeta(3-40/42) in QC catalyzed glutamate cyclization was manifested. Hence, consecutive conversion of Abeta(1-40/42) by DPPIV and QC can be assumed as a potential mechanism of formation of non-degrading pyroglutamated pE-Abeta(3-40/42), which might accumulate and contribute to AD progression. The in vitro acceleration of Abeta(1-40) aggregation in the simultaneous presence of DPPIV and QC was shown also.

29226873|t|Modeling Prion-Like Processing of Tau Protein in Alzheimer's Disease for Pharmaceutical Development.
29226873|a|Following our discovery of a fragment from the repeat domain of tau protein as a structural constituent of the PHF-core in Alzheimer's disease (AD), we developed an assay that captured several key features of the aggregation process. Tau-tau binding through the core tau fragment could be blocked by the same diaminophenothiazines found to dissolve proteolytically stable PHFs isolated from AD brain. We found that the PHF-core tau fragment is inherently capable of auto-catalytic self-propagation in vitro, or "prion-like processing", that has now been demonstrated for several neurodegenerative disorders. Here we review the findings that led to the first clinical trials to test tau aggregation inhibitor therapy in AD as a way to block this cascade. Although further trials are still needed, the results to date suggest that a treatment targeting the prion-like processing of tau protein may have a role in both prevention and treatment of AD.

29228201|t|Widespread brain tau and its association with ageing, Braak stage and Alzheimer's dementia.
29228201|a|See Herholz (doi:10.1093/brain/awx340) for a scientific commentary on this article.Autopsy data have proposed that a topographical pattern of tauopathy occurs in the brain with the development of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. We evaluated the findings of tau-PET to better understand neurofibrillary tangle development as it is seen in cognitively unimpaired and impaired individuals. The evolution of Alzheimer's disease tauopathy in cognitively unimpaired individuals needs to be examined to better understand disease pathogenesis. Tau-PET was performed in 86 cognitively impaired individuals who all had abnormal amyloid levels and 601 cognitively unimpaired individuals. Tau-PET findings were assessed for relationships with clinical diagnosis, age, and regional uptake patterns relative to Braak stage. Regional and voxel-wise analyses were performed. Topographical findings from tau-PET were characterized using hierarchical clustering and clinical characteristic-based subcategorization. In older cognitively unimpaired individuals (>=50 years), widespread, age-related elevated tau signal was seen among those with normal or abnormal amyloid status as compared to younger cognitively unimpaired individuals (30-49 years). More frequent regional tau signal elevation throughout the brain was seen in cognitively unimpaired individuals with abnormal versus normal amyloid. Elevated tau signal was seen in regions that are considered high Braak Stage in cognitively unimpaired and cognitively impaired individuals. Hierarchical clustering and clinical characteristic-based categorizations both showed different patterns of tau signal between groups such as greater tau signal in frontal regions in younger onset Alzheimer's disease dementia participants (most of whom had a dysexecutive clinical presentation). Tau-PET signal increases modestly with age throughout the brain in cognitively unimpaired individuals and elevated tau is seen more often when amyloid brain accumulation is present. Tau signal patterns in cognitively unimpaired correspond to early Braak stage but also suggest tangle involvement in extra-medial temporal and extra-temporal regions that are considered more advanced in the Braak scheme even when amyloid negative. Our findings also suggest the possibility of widespread development of early tangle pathology rather than a pattern defined exclusively by adjacent, region-to-region spread, prior to onset of clinical symptoms. Distinct patterns of neurofibrillary tangle deposition in younger-onset Alzheimer's disease dementia versus older-onset Alzheimer's disease dementia provide evidence for variability in regional tangle deposition patterns and demonstrate that different disease phenotypes have different patterns of tauopathy. Pathological correlation with imaging is needed to assess the implications of these observations.

29229533|t|Xanthoceraside attenuates amyloid beta peptide1-42-induced memory impairments by reducing neuroinflammatory responses in mice.
29229533|a|Xanthoceraside, a novel triterpenoid saponin extracted from the husks of Xanthoceras sorbifolia Bunge, has neuroprotective effects in vivo and anti-inflammatory properties in vitro. However, the exact mechanism of xanthoceraside on anti-amyloid beta (Abeta)-induced neuroinflammatory responses has not been elucidated. Therefore, we used intracerebroventricular injection of amyloid 1-42 (Abeta1-42) to establish a mouse model to test the effects of xanthoceraside on Abeta-induced cognitive impairments and the TLR2/NF-kappaB and MAPK pathways. The mice received xanthoceraside (0.02, 0.08 or 0.32mg/kg) or vehicle from the day of Abeta1-42 injection. The Morris water maze test was performed 4 days after Abeta1-42 injection. The levels of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-4) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and cluster of differentiation 11b (CD11b) in the hippocampus were determined with an immunohistochemistry assay. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) were analysed by Western blotting; iNOS, COX-2 and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) mRNA expression levels were measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Here, we observed that xanthoceraside at doses of 0.08 and 0.32mg/kg significantly improved learning and memory impairments and significantly inhibited GFAP and CD11b overexpression induced by Abeta1-42 in mice. ELISA results revealed that xanthoceraside suppressed IL-6 release and increased IL-4 levels. Western blotting results showed that xanthoceraside reduced iNOS and COX-2 protein levels in hippocampus; xanthoceraside also inhibited translocation of NF-kappaB p50 and p65 into the nucleus and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38. RT-PCR confirmed that xanthoceraside decreased iNOS, COX-2 and TLR2 mRNA levels. These results suggest that xanthoceraside inhibition of the TLR2 pathway and down-regulation of MAPK and NF-kappaB activities may be related to the improvement in learning and memory impairments.

29232976|t|Application of MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS for relative quantitation of alpha- and beta-Asp7 isoforms of amyloid-beta peptide.
29232976|a|It is known that aspartic acid isomerization process plays a role in aging processes and may be used as a marker for aging of natural materials. As for Alzheimer's disease, the most abundant modification in the peptide profile is the aspartate isomerization of amyloid-beta. Liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry-based approaches with Collision Induced Dissociation (CID) or Electron Capture Dissociation (ECD) fragmentation provide a good and precise method for the relative quantitation of iso- to normal amyloid-beta peptides but require additional time consuming steps. In this study, MALDI-TOF/TOF-matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (MS) method was developed as a high-throughput approach for the relative quantitation of the isomerized form of the amyloid-beta peptide.

29233480|t|Forecasting the prevalence of preclinical and clinical Alzheimer's disease in the United States.
29233480|a|INTRODUCTION: We forecast the prevalence of preclinical and clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) and evaluated potential impacts of primary and secondary preventions in the United States. METHODS: We used a multistate model incorporating biomarkers for preclinical AD with US population projections. RESULTS: Approximately 6.08 million Americans had either clinical AD or mild cognitive impairment due to AD in 2017 and that will grow to 15.0 million by 2060. In 2017, 46.7 million Americans had preclinical AD (amyloidosis, neurodegeneration, or both), although many may not progress to clinical disease during their lifetimes. Primary and secondary preventions have differential impact on future disease burden. DISCUSSION: Because large numbers of persons are living with preclinical AD, our results underscore the need for secondary preventions for persons with existing AD brain pathology who are likely to develop clinical disease during their lifetimes as well as primary preventions for persons without preclinical disease.

29235155|t|Effects of force fields on the conformational and dynamic properties of amyloid beta(1-40) dimer explored by replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations.
29235155|a|The conformational space and structural ensembles of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides and their oligomers in solution are inherently disordered and proven to be challenging to study. Optimum force field selection for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the biophysical relevance of results are still unknown. We compared the conformational space of the Abeta(1-40) dimers by 300 ns replica exchange MD simulations at physiological temperature (310 K) using: the AMBER-ff99sb-ILDN, AMBER-ff99sb*-ILDN, AMBER-ff99sb-NMR, and CHARMM22* force fields. Statistical comparisons of simulation results to experimental data and previously published simulations utilizing the CHARMM22* and CHARMM36 force fields were performed. All force fields yield sampled ensembles of conformations with collision cross sectional areas for the dimer that are statistically significantly larger than experimental results. All force fields, with the exception of AMBER-ff99sb-ILDN (8.8 +- 6.4%) and CHARMM36 (2.7 +- 4.2%), tend to overestimate the alpha-helical content compared to experimental CD (5.3 +- 5.2%). Using the AMBER-ff99sb-NMR force field resulted in the greatest degree of variance (41.3 +- 12.9%). Except for the AMBER-ff99sb-NMR force field, the others tended to under estimate the expected amount of beta-sheet and over estimate the amount of turn/bend/random coil conformations. All force fields, with the exception AMBER-ff99sb-NMR, reproduce a theoretically expected beta-sheet-turn-beta-sheet conformational motif, however, only the CHARMM22* and CHARMM36 force fields yield results compatible with collapse of the central and C-terminal hydrophobic cores from residues 17-21 and 30-36. Although analyses of essential subspace sampling showed only minor variations between force fields, secondary structures of lowest energy conformers are different.

29235220|t|Not Oligomers but Amyloids are Cytotoxic in the Membrane-Mediated Amyloidogenesis of Amyloid-beta Peptides.
29235220|a|The formation of neurotoxic aggregates by amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is considered to be a key step in the onset of Alzheimer's disease. It is widely accepted that oligomers are more neurotoxic than amyloid fibrils in the aqueous-phase aggregation of Abeta. Membrane-mediated amyloidogenesis is also relevant to the pathology, although the relationship between the aggregate size and cytotoxicity has remained elusive. Here, aggregation processes of Abeta on living cells and cytotoxic events were monitored by fluorescence techniques. Abeta formed amyloids after forming oligomers composed of  10 Abeta molecules. The formation of amyloids was necessary to activate apoptotic caspase-3 and reduce the ability of the cell to proliferate; this indicated that amyloid formation is a key event in Abeta-induced cytotoxicity.

29235346|t|Pathways of Amyloid-beta Aggregation Depend on Oligomer Shape.
29235346|a|One of the main research topics related to Alzheimer's disease is the aggregation of the amyloid-beta peptide, which was shown to follow different pathways for the two major alloforms of the peptide, Abeta40 and the more toxic Abeta42. Experimental studies emphasized that oligomers of specific sizes appear in the early aggregation process in different quantities and might be the key toxic agents for each of the two alloforms. We use transition networks derived from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to show that the oligomers leading to the type of oligomer distributions observed in experiments originate from compact conformations. Extended oligomers, on the other hand, contribute more to the production of larger aggregates thus driving the aggregation process. We further demonstrate that differences in the aggregation pathways of the two Abeta alloforms occur as early as during the dimer stage. The higher solvent-exposure of hydrophobic residues in Abeta42 oligomers contributes to the different aggregation pathways of both alloforms and also to the increased cytotoxicity of Abeta42.

29239599|t|Tau Derived Hexapeptide AcPHF6 Promotes Beta-Amyloid (Abeta) Fibrillogenesis.
29239599|a|We studied the interactions of a tau derived hexapeptide AcPHF6 with beta-amyloid peptides Abeta40 and Abeta42 which reveals its unusual ability to promote Abeta fibrillogenesis. The results demonstrate that the N-acetylated and C-amidated AcPHF6 hexapeptide can cause significant acceleration in Abeta40 and Abeta42 fibril growth. Aggregation kinetic studies at pH 7.4 show that at 25 muM, AcPHF6 hexapeptide was able to cause ~2.3-fold increase in Abeta40 fibrillogenesis dramatically changing the aggregation kinetics. In addition, AcPHF6 peptide was able to reduce cellular toxicity mediated by Abeta40 and Abeta42 in hippocampal neuronal cell line (HT22). Computational studies suggest that the AcPHF6 peptide can act as an anchor and provides a hydrophobic surface for Abeta monomer to bind and undergo rapid fibrillogenesis to form less toxic fibrils and alter the aggregation kinetics. At the molecular level we propose a "dock-and-pack" mechanism where the AcPHF6 hexapeptide aggregates can stabilize the beta-hairpin and promote rapid Abeta self-assembly and growth to form less toxic oligomers or fibrils. Our results have direct implications in designing novel peptide/peptidomimetics as novel pharmacological tools to study protein aggregation and potentially prevent Abeta-mediated toxicity in Alzheimer's disease.

29240407|t|Membrane Determinants Affect Fibrillation Processes of beta-Sheet Charged Peptides.
29240407|a|Assembly of fibrillar peptide structures is dependent both upon their intrinsic propensities toward beta-structure formation, as well as on structural modulation by external molecular factors. beta-sheet structures may either be designed to form useful assemblies or be the undesired consequence of protein denaturation to toxic amyloid structures in several neurodegenerative diseases. Membrane bilayers have been implicated as primary initiators and modulators of amyloid fibrillation and the reasons for this effect are yet to be elucidated. Here, we employed a set of three charged peptides having the tendency to form beta-sheet fibrils, to investigate the effect of zwitterionic and negatively charged bilayer vesicles on their assembly structures. Microscopic and spectroscopic experiments revealed intimate relationship between peptide/membrane charges and fibrillation properties. Electrostatic attraction was apparent between oppositely charged peptides and vesicles; however, such interactions did not appear to significantly modulate fibril morphologies of either the net anionic peptide or the cationic one. Yet, a dramatic structural effect was observed when the nominal zwitterionic peptide underwent fibrillation in the presence of negatively charged vesicles. Assemblies of this peptide display a net positive charge, which facilitated the counterionic interactions with the vesicles. Furthermore, these interactions templated a unique twisted fiber morphology demonstrating the dramatic effect membrane-mediated interactions exert on fibril morphologies.

29240990|t|Wnt signaling loss accelerates the appearance of neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease in J20-APP transgenic and wild-type mice.
29240990|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative pathology characterized by aggregates of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and phosphorylated tau protein, synaptic dysfunction, and spatial memory impairment. The Wnt signaling pathway has several key functions in the adult brain and has been associated with AD, mainly as a neuroprotective factor against Abeta toxicity and tau phosphorylation. However, dysfunction of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling might also play a role in the onset and development of the disease. J20 APPswInd transgenic (Tg) mouse model of AD was treated i.p. with various Wnt signaling inhibitors for 10 weeks during pre-symptomatic stages. Then, cognitive, biochemical and histochemical analyses were performed. Wnt signaling inhibitors induced severe changes in the hippocampus, including alterations in Wnt pathway components and loss of Wnt signaling function, severe cognitive deficits, increased tau phosphorylation and Abeta1-42 peptide levels, decreased Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and Abeta1-42 concentration in the cerebral spinal fluid, and high levels of soluble Abeta species and synaptotoxic oligomers in the hippocampus, together with changes in the amount and size of senile plaques. More important, we also observed severe alterations in treated wild-type (WT) mice, including behavioral impairment, tau phosphorylation, increased Abeta1-42 in the hippocampus, decreased Abeta1-42 in the cerebral spinal fluid, and hippocampal dysfunction. Wnt inhibition accelerated the development of the pathology in a Tg AD mouse model and contributed to the development of Alzheimer's-like changes in WT mice. These results indicate that Wnt signaling plays important roles in the structure and function of the adult hippocampus and suggest that inhibition of the Wnt signaling pathway is an important factor in the pathogenesis of AD.

29241655|t|Citalopram restores short-term memory deficit and non-cognitive behaviors in APP/PS1 mice while halting the advance of Alzheimer's disease-like pathology.
29241655|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. In addition to cognitive impairments, deficits in non-cognitive behaviors are also common neurological sequelae in AD. Here, we show that complex behavioral deficits in 7-month-old APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice include impairments in object recognition, deficient social interaction, increased depression and buried marbles. Citalopram, one of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), ameliorated the amyloid deposition in AD patients and transgenic animal models. After treatment for 4 weeks, citalopram rescued the deficits in short-term memory, sociability and depression in these mice. Further immunohistochemical analysis showed chronic citalopram treatment significantly attenuated beta-amyloid deposition and microglial activation in the brains of APP/PS1 mice as demonstrated previously. Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons, which are the primary cellular subtype of GABAergic neurons and considered indispensable for short-term memory and social interaction, also contributed to the progress of depression. Additionally, we found the citalopram could significantly increase the PV-positive neurons in the cortex of APP/PS1 mice without alteration in the hippocampus, which might contribute to the improvement of behavioral performance. Our findings suggest that citalopram might be a potential candidate for the early treatment of AD.

29241829|t|The aged rhesus macaque manifests Braak stage III/IV Alzheimer's-like pathology.
29241829|a|INTRODUCTION: An animal model of late-onset Alzheimer's disease is needed to research what causes degeneration in the absence of dominant genetic insults and why the association cortex is particularly vulnerable to degeneration. METHODS: We studied the progression of tau and amyloid cortical pathology in the aging rhesus macaque using immunoelectron microscopy and biochemical assays. RESULTS: Aging macaques exhibited the same qualitative pattern and sequence of tau and amyloid cortical pathology as humans, reaching Braak stage III/IV. Pathology began in the young-adult entorhinal cortex with protein kinase A-phosphorylation of tau, progressing to fibrillation with paired helical filaments and mature tangles in oldest animals. Tau pathology in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex paralleled but lagged behind the entorhinal cortex, not afflicting the primary visual cortex. DISCUSSION: The aging rhesus macaque provides the long-sought animal model for exploring the etiology of late-onset Alzheimer's disease and for testing preventive strategies.

29242522|t|Amyloid-beta and tau complexity - towards improved biomarkers and targeted therapies.
29242522|a|Most neurodegenerative diseases are proteinopathies, which are characterized by the aggregation of misfolded proteins. Although many proteins have an intrinsic propensity to aggregate, particularly when cellular clearance systems start to fail in the context of ageing, only a few form fibrillar aggregates. In Alzheimer disease, the peptide amyloid-beta (Abeta) and the protein tau aggregate to form plaques and tangles, respectively, which comprise the histopathological hallmarks of this disease. This Review discusses the complexity of Abeta biogenesis, trafficking, post-translational modifications and aggregation states. Tau and its various isoforms, which are subject to a vast array of post-translational modifications, are also explored. The methodological advances that revealed this complexity are described. Finally, the toxic effects of distinct species of tau and Abeta are discussed, as well as the concept of protein 'strains', and how this knowledge can facilitate the development of early disease biomarkers for stratifying patients and validating new therapies. By targeting distinct species of Abeta and tau for therapeutic intervention, the way might be paved for personalized medicine and more-targeted treatment strategies.

29244218|t|Person-specific contribution of neuropathologies to cognitive loss in old age.
29244218|a|OBJECTIVE: Mixed neuropathologies are the most common cause of dementia at the population level, but how different neuropathologies contribute to cognitive decline at the individual level remains unknown. We quantified the contribution of 9 neuropathologies to cognitive loss at an individual level. METHODS: Participants (n = 1,079) came from 2 longitudinal clinical-pathologic studies of aging. All completed 2 + cognitive evaluations (maximum = 22), died, and underwent neuropathologic examinations to identify Alzheimer disease (AD), other neurodegenerative diseases, and vascular pathologies. Linear mixed models examined associations of neuropathologies with cognitive decline and estimated the proportion of cognitive loss accounted for by each neuropathology at a person-specific level. RESULTS: Neuropathology was ubiquitous, with 94% of participants having 1+, 78% having 2+, 58% having 3+, and 35% having 4+. AD was most frequent (65%) but rarely occurred in isolation (9%). Remarkably, >230 different neuropathologic combinations were observed, each of which occurred in <6% of the cohort. The relative contributions of specific neuropathologies to cognitive loss varied widely across individuals. Although AD accounted for an average of about 50% of the observed cognitive loss, the proportion accounted for at the individual level ranged widely from 22% to 100%. Lewy bodies and hippocampal sclerosis also had potent effects, but again their impacts varied at the person-specific level. INTERPRETATION: There is much greater heterogeneity in the comorbidity and cognitive impact of age-related neuropathologies than currently appreciated, suggesting an urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches that embrace the complexity of disease to combat cognitive decline in old age.

29244265|t|Herpes Zoster and Dementia: A Nationwide Population-Based Cohort Study.
29244265|a|OBJECTIVE: Some infectious diseases have been found to be associated with cognitive impairment and dementia. However, the relationship between herpes zoster and dementia has received little attention. This study aimed to investigate this association as well as associations of antiviral treatments for herpes zoster and incident dementia using a large national sample. METHODS: Cases were identified from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database with a new diagnosis of herpes zoster (ICD-9-CM code: 053) between 1997 and 2013. Each identified individual with a case of herpes zoster was compared with 1 sex-, age-, and residence-matched control subject. Both groups were followed until the first diagnosis of dementia (ICD-9-CM codes: 290.0 to 290.4, 294.1, 331.0 to 331.2, and 331.82), withdrawal from the registry, or the end of 2013. Cox regression analyses and competing risk model were applied, adjusting for sex, age, residence, depression, autoimmune disease, ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, alcohol use disorder, and antiviral treatments for herpes zoster to evaluate the risk of interest. RESULTS: A total of 39,205 cases with herpes zoster were identified. Of the 78,410 study and comparison subjects, 4,204 were diagnosed as having dementia during a mean (SD) follow-up period of 6.22 (4.05) years. Herpes zoster was associated with a slightly increased risk of dementia in the fully adjusted model (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.11; 95% CI, 1.04-1.17). Prescriptions of antiviral therapy were associated with a reduced risk of developing dementia following the diagnosis of herpes zoster (HR = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.40-0.77). CONCLUSIONS: Herpes zoster was associated with an increased risk of dementia, independent of potential confounding factors. Antiviral treatment might be protective in preventing dementia in patients with herpes zoster.

29244999|t|Mechanical stress increases brain amyloid beta, tau, and alpha-synuclein concentrations in wild-type mice.
29244999|a|INTRODUCTION: Exposure to traumatic brain injury is a core risk factor that predisposes an individual to sporadic neurodegenerative diseases. We provide evidence that mechanical stress increases brain levels of hallmark proteins associated with neurodegeneration. METHODS: Wild-type mice were exposed to multiple regimens of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury, generating a range of combinations of impact energies, frequencies, and durations of exposure. Brain concentrations of amyloid beta 1-42 (Abeta1-42), total tau, and alpha-synuclein were measured by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: There was a highly significant main effect of impact energy, frequency, and duration of exposure on Abeta1-42, tau, and alpha-synuclein levels (P < .001), and a significant interaction between impact energy and duration of exposure for Abeta1-42 and tau (P < .001), but not for alpha-synuclein. DISCUSSION: Dose-dependent and cumulative influence of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury-induced mechanical stress may trigger and/or accelerate neurodegeneration by pushing protein concentration over the disease threshold.

29246725|t|Memory and Brain Amyloid and Tau Effects of a Bioavailable Form of Curcumin in Non-Demented Adults: A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled 18-Month Trial.
29246725|a|OBJECTIVE: Because curcumin's anti-inflammatory properties may protect the brain from neurodegeneration, we studied its effect on memory in non-demented adults and explored its impact on brain amyloid and tau accumulation using 2-(1-{6-[(2-[F-18]fluoroethyl)(methyl)amino]-2-naphthyl}ethylidene)malononitrile positron emission tomography (FDDNP-PET). METHODS: Forty subjects (age 51-84 years) were randomized to a bioavailable form of curcumin (Theracurmin  containing 90 mg of curcumin twice daily [N = 21]) or placebo (N = 19) for 18 months. Primary outcomes were verbal (Buschke Selective Reminding Test [SRT]) and visual (Brief Visual Memory Test-Revised [BVMT-R]) memory, and attention (Trail Making A) was a secondary outcome. FDDNP-PET signals (15 curcumin, 15 placebo) were determined in amygdala, hypothalamus, medial and lateral temporal, posterior cingulate, parietal, frontal, and motor (reference) regions. Mixed effects general linear models controlling for age and education, and effect sizes (ES; Cohen's d) were estimated. RESULTS: SRT Consistent Long-Term Retrieval improved with curcumin (ES = 0.63, p = 0.002) but not with placebo (ES = 0.06, p = 0.8; between-group: ES = 0.68, p = 0.05). Curcumin also improved SRT Total (ES = 0.53, p = 0.002), visual memory (BVMT-R Recall: ES = 0.50, p = 0.01; BVMT-R Delay: ES = 0.51, p = 0.006), and attention (ES = 0.96, p < 0.0001) compared with placebo (ES = 0.28, p = 0.1; between-group: ES = 0.67, p = 0.04). FDDNP binding decreased significantly in the amygdala with curcumin (ES = -0.41, p = 0.04) compared with placebo (ES = 0.08, p = 0.6; between-group: ES = 0.48, p = 0.07). In the hypothalamus, FDDNP binding did not change with curcumin (ES = -0.30, p = 0.2), but increased with placebo (ES = 0.26, p = 0.05; between-group: ES = 0.55, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Daily oral Theracurmin may lead to improved memory and attention in non-demented adults. The FDDNP-PET findings suggest that symptom benefits are associated with decreases in amyloid and tau accumulation in brain regions modulating mood and memory.

29246793|t|Long-term treadmill exercise attenuates Abeta burdens and astrocyte activation in APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
29246793|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating disease characterized with progressive neurodegenerative disorders in the elderly. Epidemiological and clinical studies reported that lifestyle factors could halt the progression of AD, especially physical exercise. In the present work, we investigated the effects of long-term treadmill exercise on the pathological cascades of AD in APP/PS1 mice. After exercise for 5 months, Abeta deposition was significantly ameliorated in terms of Abeta area fraction, plaque number and size. We also found that long-term treadmill exercise increased neuronal density and attenuated activation of astrocytes. However, the activation of microglia was not affected in APP/PS1 mice treated with exercise intervention. In addition, the amyloidogenic pathway of amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism was inhibited, with the decrease of beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and presenilin 1 (PS1). Nevertheless, the nonamyloidogenic pathway of APP metabolism was increased after exercise intervention. The expression levels of insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) also declined significantly. In conclusion, long-term treadmill exercise is neuroprotective against Abeta burdens and astrocyte activation, which contributes to the therapy for AD.

29246925|t|Abeta mediates F-actin disassembly in dendritic spines leading to cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease.
29246925|a|Dendritic spine loss is recognized as an early feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Dendritic spine structure is defined by filamentous actin (F-actin) and we observed depolymerization of synaptosomal F-actin accompanied by increased globular-actin (G-actin) at as early as 1 month of age in a mouse model of AD (APPswe/PS1DeltaE9, male mice). This led to recall deficit after contextual fear conditioning (cFC) at 2 months of age in APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 male mice, which could be reversed by the actin-polymerizing agent jasplakinolide. Further, the F-actin-depolymerizing agent latrunculin induced recall deficit after cFC in WT mice, indicating the importance of maintaining F-/G-actin equilibrium for optimal behavioral response. Using direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), we show that F-actin depolymerization in spines leads to a breakdown of the nano-organization of outwardly radiating F-actin rods in cortical neurons from APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 mice. Our results demonstrate that synaptic dysfunction seen as F-actin disassembly occurs very early, before onset of pathological hallmarks in AD mice, and contributes to behavioral dysfunction, indicating that depolymerization of F-actin is causal and not consequent to decreased spine density. Further, we observed decreased synaptosomal F-actin levels in postmortem brain from mild cognitive impairment and AD patients compared with subjects with normal cognition. F-actin decrease correlated inversely with increasing AD pathology (Braak score, Abeta load, and tangle density) and directly with performance in episodic and working memory tasks, suggesting its role in human disease pathogenesis and progression.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Synaptic dysfunction underlies cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The cytoskeletal protein actin plays a critical role in maintaining structure and function of synapses. Using cultured neurons and an AD mouse model, we show for the first time that filamentous actin (F-actin) is lost selectively from synapses early in the disease process, long before the onset of classical AD pathology. We also demonstrate that loss of synaptic F-actin contributes directly to memory deficits. Loss of synaptosomal F-actin in human postmortem tissue correlates directly with decreased performance in memory test and inversely with AD pathology. Our data highlight that synaptic cytoarchitectural changes occur early in AD and they may be targeted for the development of therapeutics.

29247837|t|Cholesterol ester hydrolase inhibitors reduce the production of synaptotoxic amyloid-beta oligomers.
29247837|a|The production of amyloid-beta (Abeta) is the key factor driving pathogenesis in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Increasing concentrations of Abeta within the brain cause synapse degeneration and the dementia that is characteristic of AD. Here the factors that affect the release of disease-relevant forms Abeta were studied in a cell model. 7PA2 cells expressing the human amyloid precursor protein released soluble Abeta oligomers that caused synapse damage in cultured neurons. Supernatants from 7PA2 cells treated with the cholesterol synthesis inhibitor squalestatin contained similar concentrations of Abeta42 to control cells but did not cause synapse damage in neuronal cultures. These supernatants contained reduced concentrations of Abeta42 oligomers and increased concentrations of Abeta42 monomers. Treatment of 7PA2 cells with platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonists had similar effects; it reduced concentrations of Abeta42 oligomers and increased concentrations of Abeta42 monomers in cell supernatants. PAF activated cholesterol ester hydrolases (CEH), enzymes that released cholesterol from stores of cholesterol esters. Inhibition of CEH also reduced concentrations of Abeta42 oligomers and increased concentrations of Abeta42 monomers in cell supernatants. The Abeta monomers produced by treated cells protected neurons against Abeta oligomer-induced synapse damage. These studies indicate that pharmacological manipulation of cells can alter the ratio of Abeta monomer:oligomer released and consequently their effects on synapses.

29247871|t|Simple and mixed complexes of copper(II) with 8-hydroxyquinoline derivatives and amino acids: Characterization in solution and potential biological implications.
29247871|a|Copper(II) complexes with 8-hydroxyquinoline (8-HQ) and two 8-HQ derivatives, namely clioquinol (CQ) and 5,7-dichloro-2-[(dimethylamino)methyl]quinolin-8-ol (PBT2), were investigated in organic and, where feasible, in aqueous solutions. This class of compounds is of particular interest in neurological disorders since they may act as metal-protein attenuating compounds and may help redistributing metal ions and restoring intracellular metal reserves, which are often perturbed in neurological patients. Several techniques, like potentiometry, UV-Vis absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), cyclic voltammetry and electrospray ionisation-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), were used to obtain information on both the formation of copper(II) complexes in solution as well as on the structure of their species. Multi-wavelength treatment of UV-Vis data clearly indicated the formation of both [Cu(PBT2)]+ and [Cu(PBT2)2] species; the speciation was also supported by ESI-MS data. The EPR results showed that the mono- and bis-copper(II) complexes with PBT2 have square-based pyramidal structures while the bis-copper (II) complexes with CQ or 8-HQ have square-planar o pseudo-octahedral geometries. The formation of copper(II) ternary complexes with 8-HQ, CQ and PBT2 and some selected neurotransmitters (glycine, glutamate and histidine) is also reported. Except for the copper(II) ternary complex with PBT2 and His, almost all ternary complexes have molecular geometries, which are not different from those of the bis-complexes. Interestingly the ternary copper(II) complexes, containing CQ, 8-HQ and PBT2 and glycine, glutamate or histidine turned out to be more soluble in aqueous solution than their binary complexes with parent 8-HQ derivatives; the copper(II) complexes can also be reduced more easily than their parent bis-complexes.

29248482|t|Targeted inhibition of RAGE reduces amyloid-beta influx across the blood-brain barrier and improves cognitive deficits in db/db mice.
29248482|a|AIMS: To investigate restorative effects of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE)-specific inhibitor FPS-ZM1 on abnormal amyloid beta (Abeta) influx across the blood brain-barrier (BBB) and cognitive deficits in db/db mice. METHODS: Abeta influx across the BBB was determined by intra-arterial infusion of 125I-Abeta1-40. Receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), Abeta, NF-kappaB p65, caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2, PSD-95 and synaptophysin were assayed by Western blot, immunohistochemistry or RT-PCR. Apoptosis was quantified by TUNEL assay. In vivo hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP) recording, Golgi Staining, Morris water maze (MWM) task and Y-maze test were performed. RESULTS: FPS-ZM1 (1.0 mg/kg i.p.) inhibited Abeta influx across the BBB and expression of RAGE participating in Abeta influx, consequently decreased hippocampal Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 in db/db mice. After FPS-ZM1 treatment, NF-kappaB signaling was inhibited, and neuronal apoptosis was reduced, which revealed by less TUNEL + cells, reduced caspase-3 activity and higher ratio of Bcl-2/Bax. In addition, FPS-ZM1 improved hippocampal plasticity evidenced by enhanced in vivo LTP and the restoration of spine deficit and increased PSD-95 expression in hippocampal neuron. Further studies found that FPS-ZM1 treatment alleviated cognitive deficits shown by better performance in behavioral tests, without significant metabolic effects on blood glucose, insulin and cerebral AGEs. CONCLUSION: Downregulation of abnormal Abeta influx across the BBB by FPS-ZM1 at higher dosage contributes to reduced neuronal apoptosis, improved hippocampal plasticity and cognitive impairment in db/db mice.

29248770|t|Development and validation of an UHPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS method for quantification of the highly hydrophilic amyloid-beta oligomer eliminating all-D-enantiomeric peptide RD2 in mouse plasma.
29248770|a|During preclinical drug development, a method for quantification of unlabeled compounds in blood plasma samples from treatment or pharmacokinetic studies in mice is required. In the current work, a rapid, specific, sensitive and validated liquid chromatography mass-spectrometric UHPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS method was developed for the quantification of the therapeutic compound RD2 in mouse plasma. RD2 is an all-D-enantiomeric peptide developed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disease finally leading to dementia. Due to RD2's highly hydrophilic properties, the sample preparation and the chromatographic separation and quantification were very challenging. The chromatographic separation of RD2 and its internal standard were accomplished on an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1 x 100 mm, 1.7 mum particle size) within 6.5 min at 50  C with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. Mobile phases consisted of water and acetonitrile with 1% formic acid and 0.025% heptafluorobutyric acid, respectively. Ions were generated by electrospray ionization (ESI) in the positive mode and the peptide was quantified by QTOF-MS. The developed extraction method for RD2 from mouse plasma revealed complete recovery. The linearity of the calibration curve was in the range of 5.3 ng/mL to 265 ng/mL (r2 > 0.999) with a lower limit of detection (LLOD) of 2.65 ng/mL and a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 5.3 ng/mL. The intra-day and inter-day accuracy and precision of RD2 in plasma ranged from -0.54% to 2.21% and from 1.97% to 8.18%, respectively. Moreover, no matrix effects were observed and RD2 remained stable in extracted mouse plasma at different conditions. Using this validated bioanalytical method, plasma samples of unlabeled RD2 or placebo treated mice were analyzed. The herein developed UHPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS method is a suitable tool for the quantitative analysis of unlabeled RD2 in plasma samples of treated mice.

29251379|t|Towards High-Throughput Modelling of Copper Reactivity Induced by Structural Disorder in Amyloid Peptides.
29251379|a|Transition metal ions often interact with disordered proteins. The affinity is high enough to compete with structured proteins, but the catalytic activity of the metal centre is often out of control and, therefore, potentially dangerous for cells. An example is a single copper ion interacting with the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide and triplet dioxygen, an interaction that is fundamental in producing reactive oxygen species in neurodegeneration. High-throughput modelling of the Cu-Abeta-O2 system was performed with the aim of providing a tool to dissect the structural features that characterise dangerous Cu-based catalysts in neurodegeneration. This study showed that the production of superoxide is a process with low-energy intermediate species, once a small population of high-energy CuI -Abeta complex is formed. This population is enhanced when Cu bridges two different peptides in 1:1 Cu:Abeta dimers. Despite the bias for high-energy reduced reactant species, the reduction of CuII -Abeta product by superoxide can also occur, in addition to that by ascorbate, because the structural disorder produces a small population of oxidant species characterised by unstable CuII coordination, coexisting with the most abundant reductant species, characterised by stable CuII coordination.

29253574|t|Metformin treatment prevents amyloid plaque deposition and memory impairment in APP/PS1 mice.
29253574|a|Alzheimer'sdisease(AD) is characterized by deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta)plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, andneuronal loss, accompaniedbyneuroinflammation. Neuroinflammatoryprocesses are thought to contribute toAD pathophysiology. Metformin has been reported to have anti-inflammatory efficacy. However, whether metformin is responsible for the anti-neuroinflammationand neuroprotection on APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 (APP/PS1) mice remains unclear. Here we showed that metformin attenuated spatial memory deficit, neuron loss in the hippocampus and enhanced neurogenesis in APP/PS1 mice. In addition, metformin administration decreased amyloid-beta (Abeta)plaque load and chronic inflammation (activated microglia and astrocytes as well as pro-inflammatory mediators) in the hippocampus and cortex. Further study demonstrated that treatment with metformin enhanced cerebral AMPK activation. Meanwhile, metformin notably suppressed the activation of P65 NF-kappaB, mTOR and S6K, reduced Bace1 protein expression. Our data suggest that metformin can exert functional recovery of memory deficits and neuroprotective effect on APP/PS1 mice via triggering neurogenesis and anti-inflammation mediated by regulating AMPK/mTOR/S6K/Bace1 and AMPK/P65 NF-kappaB signaling pathways in the hippocampus, which may contribute to improvement in neurological deficits.

29254096|t|Alzheimer-Like Pattern of Hypometabolism Emerges with Elevated Amyloid-beta Burden in Down Syndrome.
29254096|a|BACKGROUND: The Down syndrome (DS) population is genetically predisposed to amyloid-beta protein precursor overproduction and Alzheimer's disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: The temporal ordering and spatial association between amyloid-beta, glucose metabolism, and gray matter (GM) volume in the DS population can provide insight into those associations in the more common sporadic AD. METHODS: Twenty-four adults (13 male, 11 female; 39+-7 years) with DS underwent [11C]PiB, [18F]FDG, and volumetric MRI scans. Voxel-wise associations between PiB SUVR, FDG SUVR, and GM volume were investigated, with and without individual adjustments for variables of interest. RESULTS: Positive associations of PiB and age were widespread throughout the neocortex and striatum. Negative associations of FDG and age (frontal, parietal, and temporal cortex) and of GM volume and age (frontal and insular cortex) were observed. PiB and FDG were negatively associated in parietal cortex, after adjustment for GM volume. CONCLUSIONS: In adults with DS, early amyloid-beta accumulation in the striatum is divergent from sporadic AD; however, despite the early striatal amyloid-beta, glucose hypometabolism was confined to the typical AD-associated regions, which occurs similarly in autosomal dominant AD. Importantly, the glucose hypometabolism was not explained solely by increased partial volume effect due to GM volume reductions.

29254099|t|Cerebrospinal Fluid, MRI, and Florbetaben-PET in Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy-Related Inflammation.
29254099|a|BACKGROUND: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related inflammation (CAA-ri) is associated with a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker profile similar to that observed in CAA. Few CAA-ri patients have been studied by fibrillar amyloid-beta (Abeta) imaging (using 11C-Pittsburgh compound B and 18F-florbetapir, but not 18F-florbetaben). OBJECTIVE: To describe CSF biomarkers, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and 18F-florbetaben (FBB)-positron emission tomography (PET) changes in CAA-ri patients. METHODS: CSF levels of total tau, phosphorylated tau, Abeta1-42, and Abeta1-40, MRI (cerebral microbleeds count on susceptibility-weighted imaging and semi-quantitative analysis of fluid-attenuation inversion recovery white matter hyperintensities), and FBB-PET (using both cerebellar cortex and pons to calculate standardized uptake value ratios) were analyzed in nine consecutive CAA-ri patients. RESULTS: A median number of 769 cerebral microbleeds/patient were counted on MRI. When using the pons as reference region, amyloid load on FBB-PET was very strongly correlated to CSF Abeta1-40 levels (rho = -0.83, p = 0.008) and moderately correlated to cerebral microbleed numbers in the occipital lobes (rho = 0.59, p = 0.001), while comparisons with other CSF biomarkers were not statistically significant (total tau, rho = -0.63, p = 0.076; phosphorylated tau, rho = -0.68, p = 0.05; Abeta1-42, rho = -0.59, p = 0.09). All correlations were weaker, and not statistically significant, when using the cerebellum as reference region. A non-significant correlation (rho = -0.50, p = 0.18) was observed between CSF Abeta1-40 levels and cerebral microbleed numbers. CONCLUSION: In CAA-ri, CSF Abeta1-40 levels correlated well with amyloid load assessed by FBB-PET when the pons was used as reference, and to a lesser degree with cerebral microbleeds count on MRI. This confirms earlier data on CSF Abeta1-40 as an in vivo marker for CAA and CAA-ri.

29254665|t|Pittsburgh Compound B and AV-1451 positron emission tomography assessment of molecular pathologies of Alzheimer's disease in progressive supranuclear palsy.
29254665|a|INTRODUCTION: Little is known about Alzheimer's disease molecular proteins, beta-amyloid and paired helical filament (PHF) tau, in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Recent techniques have been developed to allow for investigations of these proteins in PSP. We determined the frequency of beta-amyloid deposition in PSP, and whether beta-amyloid deposition in PSP is associated with PHF-tau deposition pattern, or clinical features. METHODS: Thirty probable PSP participants underwent MRI, [18F]AV-1451 PET and Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET. Apolipoprotein (APOE) genotyping was also performed. A global PiB standard-uptake value ratio (SUVR) was calculated. AV-1451 SUVRs were calculated for a set of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related regions and a set of PSP-related regions. Voxel-level analyses were conducted to assess for differences in AV-1451 uptake patterns and MRI atrophy between PiB(+) and PiB(-) cases compared to 60 normal PiB(-) controls. Statistical testing for correlations and associations between variables of interest were also performed. RESULTS: Twelve subjects (40%) showed beta-amyloid deposition. Higher PiB SUVR correlated with older age but not with AV-1451 SUVR in the AD- or PSP-related regions. Higher AV-1451 SUVR in AD-related regions was associated with higher AV-1451 SUVR in PSP-related regions. We found little evidence for beta-amyloid related differences in clinical metrics, proportion of APOE e4 carriers, pattern of AV-1451 uptake, or pattern of atrophy. CONCLUSION: Beta-amyloid deposition occurs in a relatively high proportion of PSP subjects. Unlike in Alzheimer's disease, however, there is little evidence that beta-amyloid, and PHF-tau, play a significant role in neurodegeneration in PSP.

29260451|t|Amyloid beta-Derived Diffusible Ligands (ADDLs) Induce Abnormal Autophagy Associated with Abeta Aggregation Degree.
29260451|a|Autophagy is disturbed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and maintaining normal autophagy homeostasis is a new therapeutic strategy for AD treatment. Amyloid beta-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs), the most toxic species of which are oligomeric forms of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) that originate from amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) via autophagy; however, whether ADDLs are involved in autophagy-related AD pathogenesis remains unclear. In this study, we primarily defined the specific subsets of ADDLs, A-0, A-12, A-24, and A-48, which were generated from ADDL aggregation mixtures at different time courses of assembly. The secondary structures of ADDL subsets were detected by circular dichroism (CD). Neuronal or non-neuronal cells were exposed to the subsets of ADDLs in vitro, and then, autophagic markers were detected. Our results first showed that exogenous or endogenous LC3 puncta (autophagosomes) were induced in the cytoplasm of cells exposed to ADDLs and that the LC3 puncta were the strongest with A-24 exposure. Then, the CD spectroscopy data also indicated that the proportion of alpha-helices decreased, whereas the proportion of beta-strands and beta-turns increased during ADDL assembly from 0 to 24 h. In addition, the quantitative Western blot data demonstrated that the ratio of LC3B-II/I was significantly increased, and SQSTM1/p62 decreased over time. Finally, our results indicated that the level of phosphorylated p70 S6 kinase (p-p70 S6 kinase), which is a substrate protein in the MTOR pathway, and the ratio of p-p70 S6 kinase/p70 S6 kinase significantly decreased following A-24 exposure. Taken together, our data suggest that ADDL-induced abnormal autophagy is correlated with Abeta aggregation degree and the MTOR pathway, which might contribute to ADDL-induced AD pathogenesis.

29263008|t|Investigating the genetic architecture of dementia with Lewy bodies: a two-stage genome-wide association study.
29263008|a|BACKGROUND: Dementia with Lewy bodies is the second most common form of dementia in elderly people but has been overshadowed in the research field, partly because of similarities between dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. So far, to our knowledge, no large-scale genetic study of dementia with Lewy bodies has been done. To better understand the genetic basis of dementia with Lewy bodies, we have done a genome-wide association study with the aim of identifying genetic risk factors for this disorder. METHODS: In this two-stage genome-wide association study, we collected samples from white participants of European ancestry who had been diagnosed with dementia with Lewy bodies according to established clinical or pathological criteria. In the discovery stage (with the case cohort recruited from 22 centres in ten countries and the controls derived from two publicly available database of Genotypes and Phenotypes studies [phs000404.v1.p1 and phs000982.v1.p1] in the USA), we performed genotyping and exploited the recently established Haplotype Reference Consortium panel as the basis for imputation. Pathological samples were ascertained following autopsy in each individual brain bank, whereas clinical samples were collected after participant examination. There was no specific timeframe for collection of samples. We did association analyses in all participants with dementia with Lewy bodies, and also only in participants with pathological diagnosis. In the replication stage, we performed genotyping of significant and suggestive results from the discovery stage. Lastly, we did a meta-analysis of both stages under a fixed-effects model and used logistic regression to test for association in each stage. FINDINGS: This study included 1743 patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (1324 with pathological diagnosis) and 4454 controls (1216 patients with dementia with Lewy bodies vs 3791 controls in the discovery stage; 527 vs 663 in the replication stage). Results confirm previously reported associations: APOE (rs429358; odds ratio [OR] 2 40, 95% CI 2 14-2 70; p=1 05 x 10-48), SNCA (rs7681440; OR 0 73, 0 66-0 81; p=6 39 x 10-10), an GBA (rs35749011; OR 2 55, 1 88-3 46; p=1 78 x 10-9). They also provide some evidence for a novel candidate locus, namely CNTN1 (rs7314908; OR 1 51, 1 27-1 79; p=2 32 x 10-6); further replication will be important. Additionally, we estimate the heritable component of dementia with Lewy bodies to be about 36%. INTERPRETATION: Despite the small sample size for a genome-wide association study, and acknowledging the potential biases from ascertaining samples from multiple locations, we present the most comprehensive and well powered genetic study in dementia with Lewy bodies so far. These data show that common genetic variability has a role in the disease. FUNDING: The Alzheimer's Society and the Lewy Body Society.

29263220|t|Brain amyloid load and its associations with cognition and vascular risk factors in FINGER Study.
29263220|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate brain amyloid pathology in a dementia-risk population defined as cardiovascular risk factors, aging, and dementia risk (CAIDE) score of at least 6 but with normal cognition and to examine associations between brain amyloid load and cognitive performance and vascular risk factors. METHODS: A subgroup of 48 individuals from the Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) main study participated in brain 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-PET imaging, brain MRI, and neuropsychological assessment at the beginning of the study. Lifestyle/vascular risk factors were determined as body mass index, blood pressure, total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glucose homeostasis model assessment. White matter lesions were visually rated from MRIs by a semiquantitative Fazekas score. RESULTS: Twenty participants (42%) had a positive PiB-PET on visual analysis. The PiB-positive group performed worse in executive functioning tests, included more participants with APOE epsilon4 allele (50%), and showed slightly better glucose homeostasis compared to PiB-negative participants. PiB-positive and -negative participants did not differ significantly in other cognitive domain scores or other vascular risk factors. There was no significant difference in Fazekas score between the PiB groups. CONCLUSIONS: The high percentage of PiB-positive participants provides evidence of a successful recruitment process of the at-risk population in the main FINGER intervention trial. The results suggest a possible association between early brain amyloid accumulation and decline in executive functions. APOE epsilon4 was clearly associated with amyloid positivity, but no other risk factor was found to be associated with positive PiB-PET.

29272357|t|Minocycline reduces chronic microglial activation after brain trauma but increases neurodegeneration.
29272357|a|Survivors of a traumatic brain injury can deteriorate years later, developing brain atrophy and dementia. Traumatic brain injury triggers chronic microglial activation, but it is unclear whether this is harmful or beneficial. A successful chronic-phase treatment for traumatic brain injury might be to target microglia. In experimental models, the antibiotic minocycline inhibits microglial activation. We investigated the effect of minocycline on microglial activation and neurodegeneration using PET, MRI, and measurement of the axonal protein neurofilament light in plasma. Microglial activation was assessed using 11C-PBR28 PET. The relationships of microglial activation to measures of brain injury, and the effects of minocycline on disease progression, were assessed using structural and diffusion MRI, plasma neurofilament light, and cognitive assessment. Fifteen patients at least 6 months after a moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury received either minocycline 100 mg orally twice daily or no drug, for 12 weeks. At baseline, 11C-PBR28 binding in patients was increased compared to controls in cerebral white matter and thalamus, and plasma neurofilament light levels were elevated. MRI measures of white matter damage were highest in areas of greater 11C-PBR28 binding. Minocycline reduced 11C-PBR28 binding (mean Deltawhite matter binding = -23.30%, 95% confidence interval -40.9 to -5.64%, P = 0.018), but increased plasma neurofilament light levels. Faster rates of brain atrophy were found in patients with higher baseline neurofilament light levels. In this experimental medicine study, minocycline after traumatic brain injury reduced chronic microglial activation while increasing a marker of neurodegeneration. These findings suggest that microglial activation has a reparative effect in the chronic phase of traumatic brain injury.

29272738|t|Monomeric amyloid-beta reduced amyloid-beta oligomer-induced synapse damage in neuronal cultures.
29272738|a|Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the brain. Abeta oligomers are believed to cause synapse damage resulting in the memory deficits that are characteristic of this disease. Since the loss of synaptic proteins in the brain correlates closely with the degree of dementia in Alzheimer's disease, the process of Abeta-induced synapse damage was investigated in cultured neurons by measuring the loss of synaptic proteins. Soluble Abeta oligomers, derived from Alzheimer's-affected brains, caused the loss of cysteine string protein and synaptophysin from neurons. When applied to synaptosomes Abeta oligomers increased cholesterol concentrations and caused aberrant activation of cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). In contrast, Abeta monomer preparations did not affect cholesterol concentrations or activate synaptic cPLA2, nor did they damage synapses. The Abeta oligomer-induced aggregation of cellular prion proteins (PrPC) at synapses triggered the activation of cPLA2 that leads to synapse degeneration. Critically, Abeta monomer preparations did not cause the aggregation of PrPC; rather they reduced the Abeta oligomer-induced aggregation of PrPC. The presence of Abeta monomer preparations also inhibited the Abeta oligomer-induced increase in cholesterol concentrations and activation of cPLA2 in synaptosomes and protected neurons against the Abeta oligomer-induced synapse damage. These results support the hypothesis that Abeta monomers are neuroprotective. We hypothesise that synapse damage may result from a pathological Abeta monomer:oligomer ratio rather than the total concentrations of Abeta within the brain.

29273689|t|Multiple pathways of reserve simultaneously present in cognitively normal older adults.
29273689|a|OBJECTIVE: To examine neural correlates of intellectual activity underlying multiple pathways imparting reserve by testing that higher intellectual activity is associated with lower brain amyloid pathology, greater gray matter (GM) volume, and differential task-evoked brain activation levels as a function of amyloid positivity status among clinically intact older adults. METHODS: Eighty-two cognitively normal older adults and 46 healthy young participants underwent fMRI during task switching. All older participants completed 18F-florbetaben-PET and an individual's amyloid positivity status was determined. To assess GM volume, T1-weighted high-resolution structural images were processed using voxel-based morphometry. As lifestyle factors, intellectual activity was estimated by a composite score of vocabulary, reading ability, and years of education. RESULTS: Across all older participants, intellectual activity was associated with lower amyloid deposition in lateral and medial frontoparietal and temporal lobes but higher amyloid deposition in superior frontal and parietal cortices, larger GM volume across widespread brain regions, and reduced brain activation during task switching. These patterns of associations, however, differed by amyloid positivity status. While the patterns of associations remained similar among amyloid-negative older adults, among amyloid-positive older adults, intellectual activity was associated with increased amyloid deposition in frontoparietal cortices and increased activation during task. CONCLUSIONS: Intellectual activity simultaneously exerts both neuroprotective and compensatory effects via multiple neural pathways that promote optimal brain aging and help maintain normal cognition during amyloid accumulation.

Patients underwent cognitive testing at 3months, 1year, 4years, and 6years after hospital discharge with the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status. They received a single PET scan using amyloid PET imaging (florbetapir F18) 2 to 4years after their ICU stay. RESULTS: Amyloid (defined as a Standard Uptake Value ratio or SUVr >1.10) was present in 2 of 14 (14%) individuals, both of whom demonstrated significant cognitive impairment yet no consistent decline over time. Of the 6 impaired patients (RBANS<78), 4 (66.7%) were amyloid negative. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to assess ICU survivors with amyloid imaging. In this small sample, most patients with cognitive impairment were negative on amyloid PET imaging, which raises the possibility that ICU survivors may experience a unique form of dementia not driven by an amyloid related mechanism.

29277576|t|The release and transmission of amyloid precursor protein via exosomes.
29277576|a|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing is central in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. The healthy unaffected neurons suffer the transmission of amyloid protein from pathologically affected neurons, which may play an important role in the anatomical spread of the disease. Exosomes are appropriate candidates for transmission of amyloid species, because of their potential role as "intercellular transportation". To address a role of secreted exosomes in neuronal homeostasis in AD, we harvested exosomes from the conditioned medium of HEK293-APP Swe/Ind cells. We have demonstrated that these exosomes contained APP and were capable of efficiently transferring APP to normal primary neurons. Moreover, these exosomes had dose-dependent detrimental effect on cultured neurons. Our results suggest a key mechanism underlying the spread of amyloid protein in the brain and the acceleration of pathology in AD; exosomes secretion serves to amplify and propagate Alzheimer's disease related pathology.

29278274|t|The tau positron-emission tomography tracer AV-1451 binds with similar affinities to tau fibrils and monoamine oxidases.
29278274|a|BACKGROUND: Lilly/Avid's AV-1451 is one of the most advanced tau PET tracers in the clinic. Although results obtained in Alzheimer's disease patients are compelling, discrimination of tracer uptake in healthy individuals and patients with supranuclear palsy (PSP) is less clear as there is substantial overlap of signal in multiple brain regions. Moreover, accurate quantification of [18 F]AV-1451 uptake in Alzheimer's disease may not be possible. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to characterize the in vitro binding of AV-1451 to understand and identify potential off-target binding that could explain the poor discrimination observed in PSP patients. METHODS: [3 H]AV-1451 and AV-1451 were characterized in in vitro binding assays using recombinant and native proteins/tissues from postmortem samples of controls and Alzheimer's disease and PSP patients. RESULTS: [3 H]AV-1451 binds to multiple sites with nanomolar affinities in brain homogenates and to tau fibrils isolated from Alzheimer's disease or PSP patients. [3 H]AV-1451 also binds with similarly high affinities in brain homogenates devoid of tau pathology. This unexpected binding was demonstrated to be because of nanomolar affinities of [3 H]AV-1451 for monoamine oxidase A and B enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: High affinity of AV-1451 for monoamine oxidase proteins may limit its utility as a tau PET tracer in PSP and Alzheimer's disease because of high levels of monoamine oxidase expression in brain regions also affected by tau deposition, especially if monoamine oxidase levels change over time or with a treatment intervention.   2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

29279202|t|The Emerging Relationship Between Interstitial Fluid-Cerebrospinal Fluid Exchange, Amyloid-beta, and Sleep.
29279202|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques are a key histopathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and soluble Abeta species are believed to play an important role in the clinical development of this disease. Emerging biomarker data demonstrate that Abeta plaque deposition begins decades before the onset of clinical symptoms, suggesting that understanding the biological determinants of the earliest steps in the development of AD pathology may provide key opportunities for AD treatment and prevention. Although a clinical association between sleep disruption and AD has long been appreciated, emerging clinical studies and insights from the basic neurosciences have shed important new light on how sleep and Abeta homeostasis may be connected in the setting of AD. Abeta, like many interstitial solutes, is cleared in part through the exchange of brain interstitial fluid and cerebrospinal fluid along a brain-wide network of perivascular pathways recently termed the glymphatic system. Glymphatic function is primarily a feature of the sleeping brain, rather than the waking brain, and is slowed in the aging and posttraumatic brain. These changes may underlie the diurnal fluctuations in interstitial and cerebrospinal fluid Abeta levels observed in both the rodent and the human. These and other emerging studies suggest that age-related sleep disruption may be one key factor that renders the aging brain vulnerable to Abeta deposition and the development of AD. If this is true, sleep may represent a key modifiable risk factor or therapeutic target in the preclinical phases of AD.

29282295|t|Common fibrillar spines of amyloid-beta and human islet amyloid polypeptide revealed by microelectron diffraction and structure-based inhibitors.
29282295|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) and human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) aggregate to form amyloid fibrils that deposit in tissues and are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type II diabetes (T2D), respectively. Individuals with T2D have an increased risk of developing AD, and conversely, AD patients have an increased risk of developing T2D. Evidence suggests that this link between AD and T2D might originate from a structural similarity between aggregates of Abeta and hIAPP. Using the cryoEM method microelectron diffraction, we determined the atomic structures of 11-residue segments from both Abeta and hIAPP, termed Abeta(24-34) WT and hIAPP(19-29) S20G, with 64% sequence similarity. We observed a high degree of structural similarity between their backbone atoms (0.96-A root mean square deviation). Moreover, fibrils of these segments induced amyloid formation through self- and cross-seeding. Furthermore, inhibitors designed for one segment showed cross-efficacy for full-length Abeta and hIAPP and reduced cytotoxicity of both proteins, although by apparently blocking different cytotoxic mechanisms. The similarity of the atomic structures of Abeta(24-34) WT and hIAPP(19-29) S20G offers a molecular model for cross-seeding between Abeta and hIAPP.

29282337|t|Associations between [18F]AV1451 tau PET and CSF measures of tau pathology in a clinical sample.
29282337|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationships between fluid and imaging biomarkers of tau pathology and compare their diagnostic utility in a clinically heterogeneous sample. METHODS: Fifty-three patients (28 with clinical Alzheimer disease [AD] and 25 with non-AD clinical neurodegenerative diagnoses) underwent beta-amyloid (Abeta) and tau ([18F]AV1451) PET and lumbar puncture. CSF biomarkers (Abeta42, total tau [t-tau], and phosphorylated tau [p-tau]) were measured by multianalyte immunoassay (AlzBio3). Receiver operator characteristic analyses were performed to compare discrimination of Abeta-positive AD from non-AD conditions across biomarkers. Correlations between CSF biomarkers and PET standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) were assessed using skipped Pearson correlation coefficients. Voxelwise analyses were run to assess regional CSF-PET associations. RESULTS: [18F]AV1451-PET cortical SUVR and p-tau showed excellent discrimination between Abeta-positive AD and non-AD conditions (area under the curve 0.92-0.94; <=0.83 for other CSF measures), and reached 83% classification agreement. In the full sample, cortical [18F]AV1451 was associated with all CSF biomarkers, most strongly with p-tau (r = 0.75 vs 0.57 for t-tau and -0.49 for Abeta42). When restricted to Abeta-positive patients with AD, [18F]AV1451 SUVR correlated modestly with p-tau and t-tau (both r = 0.46) but not Abeta42 (r = 0.02). On voxelwise analysis, [18F]AV1451 correlated with CSF p-tau in temporoparietal cortices and with t-tau in medial prefrontal regions. Within AD, Mini-Mental State Examination scores were associated with [18F]AV1451-PET, but not CSF biomarkers. CONCLUSION: [18F]AV1451-PET and CSF p-tau had comparable value for differential diagnosis. Correlations were robust in a heterogeneous clinical group but attenuated (although significant) in AD, suggesting that fluid and imaging biomarkers capture different aspects of tau pathology. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that, in a clinical sample of patients with a variety of suspected neurodegenerative diseases, both CSF p-tau and [18F]AV1451 distinguish AD from non-AD conditions.

29284679|t|Mesenchymal stem cells and cell-derived extracellular vesicles protect hippocampal neurons from oxidative stress and synapse damage induced by amyloid-beta oligomers.
29284679|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a disabling and highly prevalent neurodegenerative condition, for which there are no effective therapies. Soluble oligomers of the amyloid-beta peptide (AbetaOs) are thought to be proximal neurotoxins involved in early neuronal oxidative stress and synapse damage, ultimately leading to neurodegeneration and memory impairment in AD. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the neuroprotective potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) against the deleterious impact of AbetaOs on hippocampal neurons. To this end, we established transwell cocultures of rat hippocampal neurons and MSCs. We show that MSCs and MSC-derived extracellular vesicles protect neurons against AbetaO-induced oxidative stress and synapse damage, revealed by loss of pre- and postsynaptic markers. Protection by MSCs entails three complementary mechanisms: 1) internalization and degradation of AbetaOs; 2) release of extracellular vesicles containing active catalase; and 3) selective secretion of interleukin-6, interleukin-10, and vascular endothelial growth factor to the medium. Results support the notion that MSCs may represent a promising alternative for cell-based therapies in AD.

29286086|t|MicroRNA-107 prevents amyloid-beta-induced neurotoxicity and memory impairment in mice.
29286086|a|The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has still not been fully elucidated, however it is thought that the build up of amyloid plaque at least partially causes the symptoms of AD. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous non-coding small RNA molecules that regulate the expression and degradation of proteins. The present study induced symptoms of AD in mice via intraventricular injection of amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta1-42), which decreased levels of miR-107. However, miR-107 levels increased following administration of miR-107 mimic, a double-stranded RNA molecule designed to imitate the native miRNA. Intraventricular injection of Abeta1-42 aggregates led to spatial memory impairments, inhibited hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and resulted in the loss of pyramidal cells in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. The miR-107 mimic reversed the impairments of spatial memory and LTP and the loss of pyramidal neurons caused by Abeta neurotoxicity. Furthermore, the miR-107 mimic reversed the Abeta-induced increase in Abeta1-42 and phosphorylated Tau levels. Critically, Abeta1-42 injection decreased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and reduced the phosphorylation of tyrosine receptor kinase B and protein kinase B; these changes were reversed following treatment with the miR-107 mimic. Collectively, these results demonstrated that miR-107 may be a potential target for the treatment of AD.

29288971|t|Effects of safflower yellow on beta-amyloid deposition and activation of astrocytes in the brain of APP/PS1 transgenic mice.
29288971|a|Safflower yellow (SY), one of traditional Chinese medicine extracted from safflower, has been shown to have neuroprotective effects on animal models of vascular dementia and Alzheimer's diseases (AD), by inhibiting oxidative injury, neuronal apoptosis and tau hyperphosphorylation. In this study, we investigated whether safflower yellow (SY) can improve cognitive function, decrease Amyloid beta (Abeta) accumulation and overactivation of astrocytes in AD mouse model. We found that SY treatment significantly ameliorated the learning and memory deficits of APP/PS1 mice. By hematoxylin-eosin staining, we found that the neuronal loss and death in APP/PS1 mice was decreased by SY treatment. Immunohistochemical staining showed that SY treatment dramatically down-regulated Abeta1-42 deposition and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) level in APP/PS1 mice. Biochemical analysis also showed that SY treatment reduced soluble and insoluble Abeta1-42 level in the cortex and soluble Abeta1-42 level in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, we found that SY treatment decreased the expression of proteins related to generation of Abeta, and markedly increased expression of enzymes associated with clearance of Abeta in the brain of APP/PS1 mice. These results indicate that the SY can serve as a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of AD.

29292543|t|Galantamine inhibits beta-amyloid-induced cytostatic autophagy in PC12 cells through decreasing ROS production.
29292543|a|OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent brain diseases among the elderly, majority of which is caused by abnormal deposition of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta). Galantamine, currently the first-line drug in treatment of AD, has been shown to diminish Abeta-induced neurotoxicity and exert favourable neuroprotective effects, but the detail mechanisms remain unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Effects of galantamine on Abeta-induced cytotoxicity were checked by MTT, clone formation and apoptosis assays. The protein variations and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were measured by western blotting analysis and dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein diacetate assay, respectively. RESULTS: Galantamine reversed Abeta-induced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis in neuron cells PC12. Abeta activated the entire autophagy flux and accumulation of autophagosomes, and the inhibition of autophagy decreased the protein level of cleaved-caspase-3 and Abeta-induced cytotoxicity. Meanwhile, galantamine suppressed Abeta-mediated autophagy flux and accumulation of autophagosomes. Moreover, Abeta upregulated ROS accumulation, while ROS scavengers N-acetyl-l-cysteine impaired Abeta-mediated autophagy. Further investigation showed that galantamine downregulated NOX4 expression to inhibit Abeta-mediated ROS accumulation and autophagy. CONCLUSIONS: Galantamine inhibits Abeta-induced cytostatic autophagy through decreasing ROS accumulation, providing new insights into deep understanding of AD progression and molecular basis of galantamine in neuroprotection.

29293892|t|Tau burden and the functional connectome in Alzheimer's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy.
29293892|a|Alzheimer's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) represent neurodegenerative tauopathies with predominantly cortical versus subcortical disease burden. In Alzheimer's disease, neuropathology and atrophy preferentially affect 'hub' brain regions that are densely connected. It was unclear whether hubs are differentially affected by neurodegeneration because they are more likely to receive pathological proteins that propagate trans-neuronally, in a prion-like manner, or whether they are selectively vulnerable due to a lack of local trophic factors, higher metabolic demands, or differential gene expression. We assessed the relationship between tau burden and brain functional connectivity, by combining in vivo PET imaging using the ligand AV-1451, and graph theoretic measures of resting state functional MRI in 17 patients with Alzheimer's disease, 17 patients with PSP, and 12 controls. Strongly connected nodes displayed more tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease, independently of intrinsic connectivity network, validating the predictions of theories of trans-neuronal spread but not supporting a role for metabolic demands or deficient trophic support in tau accumulation. This was not a compensatory phenomenon, as the functional consequence of increasing tau burden in Alzheimer's disease was a progressive weakening of the connectivity of these same nodes, reducing weighted degree and local efficiency and resulting in weaker 'small-world' properties. Conversely, in PSP, unlike in Alzheimer's disease, those nodes that accrued pathological tau were those that displayed graph metric properties associated with increased metabolic demand and a lack of trophic support rather than strong functional connectivity. Together, these findings go some way towards explaining why Alzheimer's disease affects large scale connectivity networks throughout cortex while neuropathology in PSP is concentrated in a small number of subcortical structures. Further, we demonstrate that in PSP increasing tau burden in midbrain and deep nuclei was associated with strengthened cortico-cortical functional connectivity. Disrupted cortico-subcortical and cortico-brainstem interactions meant that information transfer took less direct paths, passing through a larger number of cortical nodes, reducing closeness centrality and eigenvector centrality in PSP, while increasing weighted degree, clustering, betweenness centrality and local efficiency. Our results have wide-ranging implications, from the validation of models of tau trafficking in humans to understanding the relationship between regional tau burden and brain functional reorganization.

29295920|t|Migration-based selections of antibodies that convert bone marrow into trafficking microglia-like cells that reduce brain amyloid beta.
29295920|a|One goal of regenerative medicine is to repair damaged tissue. This requires not only generating new cells of the proper phenotype, but also selecting for those that properly integrate into sites of injury. In our laboratory we are using a cell-migration-based in vivo selection system to generate antibodies that induce cells to both differentiate and selectively localize to different tissues. Here we describe an antibody that induces bone marrow stem cells to differentiate into microglia-like cells that traffic to the brain where they organize into typical networks. Interestingly, in the APP/PS1 Alzheimer's disease mouse model, these induced microglia-like cells are found at sites of plaque formation and significantly reduce their number. These results raise the intriguing question as to whether one can use such antibody-induced differentiation of stem cells to essentially recapitulate embryogenesis in adults to discover cells that can regenerate damaged organ systems.

29298417|t|Brain Shuttle Antibody for Alzheimer's Disease with Attenuated Peripheral Effector Function due to an Inverted Binding Mode.
29298417|a|Receptors show promise for the transport of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) across the blood-brain barrier. However, safety liabilities associated with peripheral receptor binding and Fc effector function have been reported. We present the Brain Shuttle-mAb (BS-mAb) technology, and we investigate the role of Fc effector function in vitro and in an Fcgamma receptor (FcgammaR)-humanized mouse model. Strong first infusion reactions (FIRs) were observed for a conventional mAb against transferrin receptor (TfR) with a wild-type immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) Fc. Fc effector-dead constructs completely eliminated all FIRs. Remarkably, no FIR was observed for the BS-mAb construct with a native IgG1 Fc function. Using various BS-mAb constructs, we show that TfR binding through the C-terminal BS module attenuates Fc-FcgammaR interactions, primarily because of steric hindrance. Nevertheless, BS-mAbs maintain effector function activity when binding their brain target. Thus, mAbs with full effector function can be transported in a stealth mode in the periphery while fully active when engaged with their brain target.

29298895|t|Endoplasmic reticulum stress responses in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease: Overexpression paradigm versus knockin paradigm.
29298895|a|Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is believed to play an important role in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The accumulation of misfolded proteins and perturbation of intracellular calcium homeostasis are thought to underlie the induction of ER stress, resulting in neuronal dysfunction and cell death. Several reports have shown an increased ER stress response in amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin1 (PS1) double-transgenic (Tg) AD mouse models. However, whether the ER stress observed in these mouse models is actually caused by AD pathology remains unclear. APP and PS1 contain one and nine transmembrane domains, respectively, for which it has been postulated that overexpressed membrane proteins can become wedged in a misfolded configuration in ER membranes, thereby inducing nonspecific ER stress. Here, we used an App-knockin (KI) AD mouse model that accumulates amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide without overexpressing APP to investigate whether the ER stress response is heightened because of Abeta pathology. Thorough examinations indicated that no ER stress responses arose in App-KI or single APP-Tg mice. These results suggest that PS1 overexpression or mutation induced a nonspecific ER stress response that was independent of Abeta pathology in the double-Tg mice. Moreover, we observed no ER stress in a mouse model of tauopathy (P301S-Tau-Tg mice) at various ages, suggesting that ER stress is also not essential in tau pathology-induced neurodegeneration. We conclude that the role of ER stress in AD pathogenesis needs to be carefully addressed in future studies.

29299557|t|Investigation of the interaction of amyloid beta peptide (11-42) oligomers with a 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) membrane using molecular dynamics simulation.
29299557|a|Some amyloid related proteins/peptides are involved in aggregation and pore formation in phospholipid membranes (cell membranes), which result in a variety of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington disease. In this research, the mechanism of pore formation by beta amyloid (Abeta) peptides was investigated using molecular dynamics simulation by simulating the interaction of the Abeta(11-42) peptide, with a lipid membrane and the potential of the mean force of interaction was evaluated. A 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) membrane system with different cholesterol concentrations was used to simulate the neural cell membrane. The results indicated that Abeta(11-42) peptide oligomers with peptide numbers larger than two were more likely to lead to lipid deformation and water channels, and the free energy of penetration into the membrane decreased with the increasing number of peptides. Increasing the concentration of cholesterol leads to a higher energy barrier for the penetration of peptide into the lipid bilayer thereby protecting the membrane. The results of this research have potential application in the prevention of pore formation by Abeta aggregates on the lipid membrane.

29299912|t|Light-Up Nonthiolated Aptasensor for Low-Mass, Soluble Amyloid-beta40 Oligomers at High Salt Concentrations.
29299912|a|Herein, a light-up nonthiolated aptasensor was developed for low-mass, soluble amyloid-beta40 oligomers (LS-Abeta40-O). Au nanoparticles (AuNP) were employed as colorimetric probes, and the nonthiolated aptamers (Apt) were adsorbed on AuNP surfaces, acting as binding elements for LS-Abeta40-O. The aggregation of AuNPs was induced when Apt-modified AuNPs (Apt@AuNPs) were under high-salt conditions. However, upon the addition of LS-Abeta40-O into the Apt@AuNP solution, the salt tolerance of the AuNPs was greatly enhanced. Further studies confirmed that the formed LS-Abeta40-O-Apt complex attached onto the AuNP surfaces via interactions between LS-Abeta40-O and Au, which led to electrostatic and steric stabilization of the AuNPs under high-salt conditions. On the basis of this outcome, a sensitive light-up nonthiolated aptasensor for LS-Abeta40-O was achieved with a detection limit of 10.0 nM and a linear range from 35.0 to 700 nM in a 175 mM NaCl solution. Cerebrospinal-fluid (CSF) samples from healthy persons and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients were successfully distinguished by using this proposed method. The concentrations of LS-Abeta40-O in the CSF of AD patients were of nanomolar grade, but there was no detectable LS-Abeta40-O in those of the healthy persons. This work provides a new insight into the interaction between Apt@AuNPs and Abeta40-O and also develops a simple, rapid, highly selective and sensitive, and applicable method for LS-Abeta40-O detection in real CSF samples, which is significant for the diagnosis of AD.

29301104|t|Alzheimer's Disease: From Firing Instability to Homeostasis Network Collapse.
29301104|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) starts from pure cognitive impairments and gradually progresses into degeneration of specific brain circuits. Although numerous factors initiating AD have been extensively studied, the common principles underlying the transition from cognitive deficits to neuronal loss remain unknown. Here we describe an evolutionarily conserved, integrated homeostatic network (IHN) that enables functional stability of central neural circuits and safeguards from neurodegeneration. We identify the critical modules comprising the IHN and propose a central role of neural firing in controlling the complex homeostatic network at different spatial scales. We hypothesize that firing instability and impaired synaptic plasticity at early AD stages trigger a vicious cycle, leading to dysregulation of the whole IHN. According to this hypothesis, the IHN collapse represents the major driving force of the transition from early memory impairments to neurodegeneration. Understanding the core elements of homeostatic control machinery, the reciprocal connections between distinct IHN modules, and the role of firing homeostasis in this hierarchy has important implications for physiology and should offer novel conceptual approaches for AD and other neurodegenerative disorders.

29301146|t|A Self-Microemulsifying Formulation of Oxyresveratrol Prevents Amyloid Beta Protein-Induced Neurodegeneration in Mice.
29301146|a|The polyphenol compound, oxyresveratrol (OXY) possesses potent antioxidant and neuroprotective properties of potential utility in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. However, the low oral bioavailability limits its neuroprotective effect and clinical application. The neuroprotective effect of orally administered OXY-loaded self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (OXY-SMEDDS) was compared with free OXY in vivo. Mice were orally administered either free OXY or OXY-SMEDDS once daily at a dose of 90, 180, or 360 mg/kg for 14 d. Mice received a single intracerebroventricular injection of the neurotoxic amyloid beta (Abeta)25 - 35 peptide at day 8 during oral treatment. The OXY-SMEDDS formulation resulted in four-times reduction of the free OXY dose required for prevention of neurotoxicity effects due to Abeta25 - 35 peptide as demonstrated by a significant decline in behavior impairments, lipid oxidation levels, and neuronal cell loss in all hippocampal subfields (p < 0.0001). These results indicate the potential of OXY-SMEDDS by oral delivery to improve the efficacy of this compound in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

29301548|t|Inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 affects early neuroinflammatory signalling in murine model of amyloid beta toxicity.
29301548|a|BACKGROUND: Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) belongs to the family of proline-directed serine/threonine kinases and plays a critical role in neuronal differentiation, migration, synaptogenesis, plasticity, neurotransmission and apoptosis. The deregulation of Cdk5 activity was observed in post mortem analysis of brain tissue of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, suggesting the involvement of Cdk5 in the pathomechanism of this neurodegenerative disease. However, our recent study demonstrated the important function of Cdk5 in regulating inflammatory reaction. METHODS: Since the role of Cdk5 in regulation of inflammatory signalling in AD is unknown, we investigated the involvement of Cdk5 in neuroinflammation induced by single intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) oligomers in mouse. The brain tissue was analysed up to 35 days post injection. Roscovitine (intraperitoneal administration) was used as a potent Cdk5 inhibitor. The experiments were also performed on human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y as well as mouse BV2 cell lines treated with exogenous oligomeric Abeta. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that single injection of Abeta oligomers induces long-lasting activation of microglia and astrocytes in the hippocampus. We observed also profound, early inflammatory response in the mice hippocampus, leading to the significant elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines expression (e.g. TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6). Moreover, Abeta oligomers elevated the formation of truncated protein p25 in mouse hippocampus and induced overactivation of Cdk5 in neuronal cells. Importantly, administration of roscovitine reduced the inflammatory processes evoked by Abeta in the hippocampus, leading to the significant decrease of cytokines level. CONCLUSIONS: These studies clearly show the involvement of Cdk5 in modulation of brain inflammatory response induced by Abeta and may indicate this kinase as a novel target for pharmacological intervention in AD.

29306052|t|Celecoxib Prevents Cognitive Impairment and Neuroinflammation in Soluble Amyloid beta-treated Rats.
29306052|a|Recent findings suggest that soluble forms of amyloid-beta (sAbeta) peptide contribute to synaptic and cognitive dysfunctions in early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). On the other hand, neuroinflammation and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme have gained increased interest as key factors involved early in AD, although the signaling pathways and pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying a link between sAbeta-induced neurotoxicity and inflammation are still unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of selective COX-2 enzyme inhibition on neuropathological alterations induced by sAbeta administration in rats. To this purpose, animals received an intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of predominantly monomeric forms of sAbeta and, 7 days after, behavioral as well as biochemical parameters and neurotransmitter alterations were evaluated. During this period, rats also received a sub-chronic treatment with celecoxib. Biochemical results demonstrated that icv sAbeta injection significantly increased both COX-2 and pro-inflammatory cytokines expression in the hippocampus (Hipp) of treated rats. In addition, the number of hypertrophic microglial cells and astrocytes were upregulated in sAbeta-treated group. Interestingly, rats treated with sAbeta showed long-term memory deficits, as confirmed by a significant reduction of discrimination index in the novel object recognition test, along with reduced brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression and increased noradrenaline levels in the Hipp. Systemic administration of celecoxib prevented behavioral dysfunctions, as well as biochemical and neurotransmitter alterations. In conclusion, our results suggest that sAbeta neurotoxicity might be associated to COX-2-mediated inflammatory pathways and that early treatment with selective COX-2 inhibitor might provide potential remedies to counterbalance the sAbeta-induced effects.

29309895|t|Reactive oxygen species released from astrocytes treated with amyloid beta oligomers elicit neuronal calcium signals that decrease phospho-Ser727-STAT3 nuclear content.
29309895|a|The transcription factor STAT3 has a crucial role in the development and maintenance of the nervous system. In this work, we treated astrocytes with oligomers of the amyloid beta peptide (AbetaOs), which display potent synaptotoxic activity, and studied the effects of mediators released by AbetaOs-treated astrocytes on the nuclear location of neuronal serine-727-phosphorylated STAT3 (pSerSTAT3). Treatment of mixed neuron-astrocyte cultures with 0.5microMAbetaOs induced in neurons a significant decrease of nuclear pSerSTAT3, but not of phosphotyrosine-705 STAT3, the other form of STAT3 phosphorylation. This decrease did not occur in astrocyte-poor neuronal cultures revealing a pivotal role for astrocytes in this response. To test if mediators released by astrocytes in response to AbetaOs induce pSerSTAT3 nuclear depletion, we used conditioned medium derived from AbetaOs-treated astrocyte cultures. Treatment of astrocyte-poor neuronal cultures with this medium caused pSerSTAT3 nuclear depletion but did not modify overall STAT3 levels. Extracellular catalase prevented the pSerSTAT3 nuclear depletion caused by astrocyte-conditioned medium, indicating that reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediate this response. This conditioned medium also increased neuronal oxidative tone, leading to a ryanodine-sensitive intracellular calcium signal that proved to be essential for pSerSTAT3 nuclear depletion. In addition, this depletion decreased BCL2 and Survivin transcription and significantly increased BAX/BCL2 ratio. This is the first description that ROS generated by AbetaOs-treated astrocytes and neuronal calcium signals jointly regulate pSerSTAT3 nuclear distribution in neurons. We propose that astrocytes release ROS in response to AbetaOs, which by increasing neuronal oxidative tone, generate calcium signals that cause pSerSTAT3 nuclear depletion and loss of STAT3 protective transcriptional activity.

29310864|t|Brain amyloid burden and cerebrovascular disease are synergistically associated with neurometabolism in cognitively unimpaired older adults.
29310864|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of cognitive dysfunction in older adults. The pathological hallmarks of AD such as beta amyloid (Abeta) aggregation and neurometabolic change, as indicated by altered myo-inositol (mI) and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) levels, typically precede the onset of cognitive dysfunction by years. Furthermore, cerebrovascular disease occurs early in AD, but the interplay between vascular and neurometabolic brain change is largely unknown. Thirty cognitively normal older adults (age = 70 +- 5.6 years, Mini-Mental State Examination = 29.2 +- 1) received 11-C-Pittsburgh Compound B positron emission tomography for estimating Abeta-plaque density, 7 Tesla fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging for quantifying white matter hyperintensity volume as a marker of small vessel cerebrovascular disease and high-resolution magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging at 7 Tesla, based on free induction decay acquisition localized by outer volume suppression to investigate tissue-specific neurometabolism in the posterior cingulate and precuneus. Abeta (beta = 0.45, p = 0.018) and white matter hyperintensities (beta = 0.40, p = 0.046) were independently and interactively (beta = -0.49, p = 0.026) associated with a higher ratio of mI over NAA (mI/NAA) in the posterior cingulate and precuneus gray matter but not in the white matter. Our data suggest that cerebrovascular disease and Abeta burden are synergistically associated with AD-related gray matter neurometabolism in older adults.

29311311|t|Structural heterogeneity and intersubject variability of Abeta in familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease.
29311311|a|Point mutations in the amyloid-beta (Abeta) coding region produce a combination of mutant and WT Abeta isoforms that yield unique clinicopathologies in familial Alzheimer's disease (fAD) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (fCAA) patients. Here, we report a method to investigate the structural variability of amyloid deposits found in fAD, fCAA, and sporadic AD (sAD). Using this approach, we demonstrate that mutant Abeta determines WT Abeta conformation through prion template-directed misfolding. Using principal component analysis of multiple structure-sensitive fluorescent amyloid-binding dyes, we assessed the conformational variability of Abeta deposits in fAD, fCAA, and sAD patients. Comparing many deposits from a given patient with the overall population, we found that intrapatient variability is much lower than interpatient variability for both disease types. In a given brain, we observed one or two structurally distinct forms. When two forms coexist, they segregate between the parenchyma and cerebrovasculature, particularly in fAD patients. Compared with sAD samples, deposits from fAD patients show less intersubject variability, and little overlap exists between fAD and sAD deposits. Finally, we examined whether E22G (Arctic) or E22Q (Dutch) mutants direct the misfolding of WT Abeta, leading to fAD-like plaques in vivo. Intracerebrally injecting mutant Abeta40 fibrils into transgenic mice expressing only WT Abeta induced the deposition of plaques with many biochemical hallmarks of fAD. Thus, mutant Abeta40 prions induce a conformation of WT Abeta similar to that found in fAD deposits. These findings indicate that diverse AD phenotypes likely arise from one or more initial Abeta prion conformations, which kinetically dominate the spread of prions in the brain.

29311640|t|A specific form of prefibrillar aggregates that functions as a precursor of amyloid nucleation.
29311640|a|Non-fibrillar protein aggregates that appear in the earlier stages of amyloid fibril formation are sometimes considered to play a key role in amyloid nucleation; however, the structural features of these aggregates currently remain unclear. We herein identified a characteristic pathway of fibril formation by human insulin B chain, in which two major species of prefibrillar aggregates were identified. Based on the time-resolved tracking of this pathway with far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and 1H-NMR spectroscopy, the first prefibrillar aggregate with a hydrodynamic diameter of approximately 70 nm accumulated concomitantly with the formation of a beta-sheet structure, and the size further evolved to 130 nm with an additional structural development. These prefibrillar aggregates were metastable and survived at least 24 hours as long as they were maintained under quiescent conditions. The energy barrier for nucleation was overcome by shaking or even by applying a single short ultrasonic pulse. Furthermore, an investigation where nucleation efficiency was monitored by fibrillation rates with varying the timing of the ultrasonic-pulse treatment revealed that the second prefibrillar aggregate specifically produced amyloid nuclei. These results suggest that the second form of the prefibrillar aggregates acts as a direct precursor for the amyloid nucleation.

29314823|t|Amyloid Beta Peptide VHHQ, KLVFF, and IIGLMVGGVV Domains Involved in Fibrilization: AFM and Electrochemical Characterization.
29314823|a|The time-dependent structural modifications and oxidation behavior of specifically chosen five short amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides, Abeta1-16, Abeta1-28, Abeta10-20, Abeta12-28, and Abeta17-42, fragments of the complete human Abeta1-40 peptide, were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and voltammetry. The objective was to determine the influence of different Abeta domains (VHHQ that contains electroactive histidine H residues, KLVFF that is the peptide hydrophobic aggregation core, and IIGLMVGGVV that is the C-terminus hydrophobic region), and of Abeta peptide hydrophobicity, in the fibrilization mechanism. The short Abeta peptides absence of aggregation or the time-dependent aggregation mechanisms, at room temperature, in free chloride media, within the time window from 0 to 48 h, were established by AFM via changes in their adsorption morphology, and by differential pulse voltammetry, via modifications of the amino acid residues oxidation peak currents. The first oxidation peak was of tyrosine Y residue and the second peak was of histidine H and methionine M residues oxidation. A correlation between the presence of an intact highly hydrophobic KLVFF aggregation core and the time-dependent changes on the Abeta peptides aggregation was found. The hydrophobic C-terminal domain IIGLMVGGVV, present in the Abeta1-40 peptide, also contributed to accelerate the formation of Abeta1-40 peptide aggregates and fibrils.

29318655|t|Design of nonapeptide LVFFARKHH: A bifunctional agent against Cu2+ -mediated amyloid beta-protein aggregation and cytotoxicity.
29318655|a|Dysfunctional accumulation of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) mediated by Cu2+ exhibits higher neurotoxicity and accelerates the progress of Alzheimer's disease, so inhibition of Cu2+ -mediated Abeta aggregation and cytotoxicity has been considered as a therapeutic strategy for the disease. Herein, a nonapeptide was designed by linking HH to the C-terminus of a peptide inhibitor of Abeta aggregation, LVFFARK (LK7). We found that the nonapeptide, LK7-HH, possessed dual functionality, including enhanced inhibition capability on Abeta aggregation as compared to LK7, and chelating Cu2+ with a dissociation constant of 5.50 muM. This enabled LK7-HH to arrest the generation of reactive oxygen species catalyzed by Cu2+ or Cu2+ -Abeta complex, and to inhibit Cu2+ -induced Abeta aggregation. Moreover, in contrast with the cytotoxicity of LK7 aggregates, LK7-HH was biocompatible because HH conjugation made its aggregation behavior different from LK7. Thus, LK7-HH efficiently suppressed Cu2+ -mediated Abeta aggregation and cytotoxicity. An equimolar concentration of LK7-HH increased cell viability from 50% to 90% when treating Abeta40 -Cu2+ complexes. The results provided insights into the roles of HH in enhancing the inhibition of Abeta and Cu2+ -induced Abeta aggregations, in eliminating Cu2+ -induced cytotoxicities by arresting generation of reactive oxygen species, and in making the peptide biocompatible. Therefore, this work would contribute to the design of potent peptide-based inhibitors of Cu2+ -mediated Abeta aggregation and cytotoxicity.

29319162|t|A long-lived Abeta oligomer resistant to fibrillization.
29319162|a|The hydrophobic Abeta peptide is highly aggregation prone; it first forms soluble oligomers, which then convert into the amyloid fibrils found in the cerebral plaques of Alzheimer's disease. It is generally understood that as the peptide concentration of Abeta increases, the fibrillization process is accelerated, but we examine the limits on this phenomenon. We found that once a threshold concentration of Abeta is exceeded, a stable oligomer is formed at the expense of fibril formation. The suppression of fibril formation was observed by amyloid-binding dye Thioflavin T and solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Small-angle X-ray scattering, size exclusion chromatography, and analytical ultracentrifugation demonstrated that Abeta peptides form a range of compact species, with a dimer being an early highly populated oligomer. Solution NMR allowed us to define the secondary structure of this Abeta dimer, which shows interlocking contacts between C-terminal peptide strands. Thus, we present a novel Abeta oligomer that resists conversion to fibrils and remains stable for more than one year.

29321140|t|Cerebrospinal fluid Alzheimer biomarkers can be useful for discriminating dementia with Lewy bodies from Alzheimer's disease at the prodromal stage.
29321140|a|BACKGROUND: Differential diagnosis between dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not straightforward, especially in the early stages of disease. We compared AD biomarkers (phospho-Tau181, total-Tau, Abeta42 and Abeta40) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with DLB and AD, focusing especially on the prodromal stage. METHODS: A total of 1221 CSF were collected in different memory centres (ePLM network) in France and analysed retrospectively. Samples were obtained from patients with prodromal DLB (pro-DLB; n=57), DLB dementia (DLB-d; n=154), prodromal AD (pro-AD; n=132) and AD dementia (n=783), and control subjects (CS; n=95). These centres use the same diagnostic procedure and criteria to evaluate the patients. RESULTS: In patients with pro-DLB, CSF Abeta42 levels appeared much less disrupted than in patients at the demented stage (DLB-d) (P<0.05 CS>pro-DLB; P<0.001 CS>DLB-d). On average, Abeta40 levels in patients with DLB (pro-DLB and DLB-d) were much below those in patients with pro-AD (P<0.001 DLB groups<pro-AD). The Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio in patients with pro-DLB remained close to that of CS. t-Tau and phospho-Tau181 levels were unaltered in patients with DLB (pro-DLB and DLB-d). CONCLUSIONS: Reduced levels of CSF Abeta42 were found in patients with DLB but rather at a later stage, reaching those of patients with AD, in whom Abeta42 levels were decreased even at the prodromal stage. At the prodromal stage of DLB, the majority of patients presented a normal CSF profile. CSF t-Tau and phospho-Tau181 were the best biomarkers to discriminate between AD and DLB, whatever the stage of disease.

29321225|t|Humanized TREM2 mice reveal microglia-intrinsic and -extrinsic effects of R47H polymorphism.
29321225|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that causes late-onset dementia. The R47H variant of the microglial receptor TREM2 triples AD risk in genome-wide association studies. In mouse AD models, TREM2-deficient microglia fail to proliferate and cluster around the amyloid-beta plaques characteristic of AD. In vitro, the common variant (CV) of TREM2 binds anionic lipids, whereas R47H mutation impairs binding. However, in vivo, the identity of TREM2 ligands and effect of the R47H variant remain unknown. We generated transgenic mice expressing human CV or R47H TREM2 and lacking endogenous TREM2 in the 5XFAD AD model. Only the CV transgene restored amyloid-beta-induced microgliosis and microglial activation, indicating that R47H impairs TREM2 function in vivo. Remarkably, soluble TREM2 was found on neurons and plaques in CV- but not R47H-expressing 5XFAD brains, although in vitro CV and R47H were shed similarly via Adam17 proteolytic activity. These results demonstrate that TREM2 interacts with neurons and plaques duing amyloid-beta accumulation and R47H impairs this interaction.

29321235|t|Comparing 18F-AV-1451 with CSF t-tau and p-tau for diagnosis of Alzheimer disease.
29321235|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare PET imaging of tau pathology with CSF measurements (total tau [t-tau] and phosphorylated tau [p-tau]) in terms of diagnostic performance for Alzheimer disease (AD). METHODS: We compared t-tau and p-tau and 18F-AV-1451 in 30 controls, 14 patients with prodromal AD, and 39 patients with Alzheimer dementia, recruited from the Swedish BioFINDER study. All patients with AD (prodromal and dementia) were screened for amyloid positivity using CSF beta-amyloid 42. Retention of 18F-AV-1451 was measured in a priori specified regions, selected for known associations with tau pathology in AD. RESULTS: Retention of 18F-AV-1451 was markedly elevated in Alzheimer dementia and moderately elevated in prodromal AD. CSF t-tau and p-tau was increased to similar levels in both AD dementia and prodromal AD. 18F-AV-1451 had very good diagnostic performance for Alzheimer dementia (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] ~1.000), and was significantly better than t-tau (0.876), p-tau (0.890), hippocampal volume (0.824), and temporal cortical thickness (0.860). For prodromal AD, there were no significant AUROC differences between CSF tau and 18F-AV-1451 measures (0.836-0.939), but MRI measures had lower AUROCs (0.652-0.769). CONCLUSIONS: CSF tau and 18F-AV-1451 have equal performance in early clinical stages of AD, but 18F-AV-1451 is superior in the dementia stage, and exhibits close to perfect diagnostic performance for mild to moderate AD. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that CSF tau and 18F-AV-1451 PET have similar performance in identifying early AD, and that 18F-AV-1451 PET is superior to CSF tau in identifying mild to moderate AD.

29321592|t|Amyloid beta causes excitation/inhibition imbalance through dopamine receptor 1-dependent disruption of fast-spiking GABAergic input in anterior cingulate cortex.
29321592|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. At the early stages of AD development, the soluble beta-amyloid (Abeta) induces synaptic dysfunction, perturbs the excitation/inhibition balance of neural circuitries, and in turn alters the normal neural network activity leading to cognitive decline, but the underlying mechanisms are not well established. Here by using whole-cell recordings in acute mouse brain slices, we found that 50 nM Abeta induces hyperexcitability of excitatory pyramidal cells in the cingulate cortex, one of the most vulnerable areas in AD, via depressing inhibitory synaptic transmission. Furthermore, by simultaneously recording multiple cells, we discovered that the inhibitory innervation of pyramidal cells from fast-spiking (FS) interneurons instead of non-FS interneurons is dramatically disrupted by Abeta, and perturbation of the presynaptic inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release underlies this inhibitory input disruption. Finally, we identified the increased dopamine action on dopamine D1 receptor of FS interneurons as a key pathological factor that contributes to GABAergic input perturbation and excitation/inhibition imbalance caused by Abeta. Thus, we conclude that the dopamine receptor 1-dependent disruption of FS GABAergic inhibitory input plays a critical role in Abeta-induced excitation/inhibition imbalance in anterior cingulate cortex.

29322650|t|Molecular characterization of the beta-amyloid(4-10) epitope of plaque specific Abeta antibodies by affinity-mass spectrometry using alanine site mutation.
29322650|a|Alzheimer disease is a neurodegenerative disease affecting an increasing number of patients worldwide. Current therapeutic strategies are directed to molecules capable to block the aggregation of the beta-amyloid(1-42) (Abeta) peptide and its shorter naturally occurring peptide fragments into toxic oligomers and amyloid fibrils. Abeta-specific antibodies have been recently developed as powerful antiaggregation tools. The identification and functional characterization of the epitope structures of Abeta antibodies contributes to the elucidation of their mechanism of action in the human organism. In previous studies, the Abeta(4-10) peptide has been identified as an epitope for the polyclonal anti-Abeta(1-42) antibody that has been shown capable to reduce amyloid deposition in a transgenic Alzheimer disease mouse model. To determine the functional significance of the amino acid residues involved in binding to the antibody, we report here the effects of alanine single-site mutations within the Abeta-epitope sequence on the antigen-antibody interaction. Specific identification of the essential affinity preserving mutant peptides was obtained by exposing a Sepharose-immobilized antibody column to an equimolar mixture of mutant peptides, followed by analysis of bound peptides using high-resolution MALDI-Fourier transform-Ion Cyclotron Resonance mass spectrometry. For the polyclonal antibody, affinity was preserved in the H6A, D7A, S8A, and G9A mutants but was lost in the F4, R5, and Y10 mutants, indicating these residues as essential amino acids for binding. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays confirmed the binding differences of the mutant peptides to the polyclonal antibody. In contrast, the mass spectrometric analysis of the mutant Abeta(4-10) peptides upon affinity binding to a monoclonal anti-Abeta(1-17) antibody showed complete loss of binding by Ala-site mutation of any residue of the Abeta(4-10) epitope. Surface plasmon resonance affinity determination of wild-type Abeta(1-17) to the monoclonal Abeta antibody provided a binding constant KD in the low nanomolar range. These results provide valuable information in the elucidation of the binding mechanism and the development of Abeta-specific antibodies with improved therapeutic efficacy.

29323711|t|HIV-1 increases extracellular amyloid-beta levels through neprilysin regulation in primary cultures of human astrocytes.
29323711|a|Since the success of combined antiretroviral therapy, HIV-1-infected individuals are now living much longer. This increased life expectancy is accompanied by a higher prevalence of HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorders. Rising too is the incidence in these patients of pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease such as increased deposition of amyloid beta protein (Abeta). Although neurons are major sources of Abeta in the brain, astrocytes are the most numerous glial cells, therefore, even a small level of astrocytic Abeta metabolism could make a significant contribution to brain pathology. Neprilysin (NEP) is a decisive/crucial regulator of Abeta levels. We evaluated the effects of HIV-1 on Abeta deposition and the expression and activity of NEP in primary human astrocytes. Specifically, no differences in intracellular amyloid deposits were found between infected and control cells. However, primary cultures of infected astrocytes showed more extracellular Abeta levels compared to controls. This was accompanied by reduced expression of NEP and to a significant decrease in its activity. These results indicate that the presence of HIV-1 in the brain could contribute to the increase in the total burden of cerebral Abeta.

29325447|t|Longitudinal Association of Amyloid Beta and Anxious-Depressive Symptoms in Cognitively Normal Older Adults.
29325447|a|OBJECTIVE: To understand the role of depressive symptoms in preclinical Alzheimer's disease, it is essential to define their temporal relationship to Alzheimer's proteinopathies in cognitively normal older adults. The study objective was to examine associations of brain amyloid beta and longitudinal measures of depression and depressive symptom clusters in a cognitively normal sample of older adults. METHOD: A total of 270 community-dwelling, cognitively normal elderly individuals underwent baseline Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET) measures of cortical aggregate amyloid beta and annual assessments with the 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). The authors evaluated continuous PiB binding as a predictor of GDS score or GDS cluster, calculated as total scores and mean scores for three GDS item clusters (apathy-anhedonia, dysphoria, and anxiety-concentration), across time (1-5 years; mean=3.8 years) in separate mixed-effects models with backward elimination. Initial predictors included PiB binding, age, sex, Hollingshead score, American National Adult Reading Test (AMNART) score, apolipoprotein E epsilon4 status, depression history, and their interactions with time. RESULTS: Higher PiB binding predicted accelerated rates of increase in GDS score over time, adjusting for depression history. Higher PiB binding also predicted steeper rates of increase for anxiety-concentration scores, adjusting for depression history and the AMNART score-by-time interaction. In a post hoc model estimating anxiety scores without concentration disturbance items, the PiB binding-by-time interaction remained significant. CONCLUSIONS: Higher amyloid beta burden was associated with increasing anxious-depressive symptoms over time in cognitively normal older individuals. Prior depression history was related to higher but not worsening symptom ratings. These results suggest a direct or indirect association of elevated amyloid beta levels with worsening anxious-depressive symptoms and support the hypothesis that emerging neuropsychiatric symptoms represent an early manifestation of preclinical Alzheimer's disease.

29327084|t|BACE1 inhibition more effectively suppresses initiation than progression of beta-amyloid pathology.
29327084|a|BACE1 is the rate-limiting protease in the production of synaptotoxic beta-amyloid (Abeta) species and hence one of the prime drug targets for potential therapy of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, so far pharmacological BACE1 inhibition failed to rescue the cognitive decline in mild-to-moderate AD patients, which indicates that treatment at the symptomatic stage might be too late. In the current study, chronic in vivo two-photon microscopy was performed in a transgenic AD model to monitor the impact of pharmacological BACE1 inhibition on early beta-amyloid pathology. The longitudinal approach allowed to assess the kinetics of individual plaques and associated presynaptic pathology, before and throughout treatment. BACE1 inhibition could not halt but slow down progressive beta-amyloid deposition and associated synaptic pathology. Notably, the data revealed that the initial process of plaque formation, rather than the subsequent phase of gradual plaque growth, is most sensitive to BACE1 inhibition. This finding of particular susceptibility of plaque formation has profound implications to achieve optimal therapeutic efficacy for the prospective treatment of AD.

29328926|t|DNA damage-associated oligodendrocyte degeneration precedes amyloid pathology and contributes to Alzheimer's disease and dementia.
29328926|a|INTRODUCTION: In looking for novel non-amyloid-based etiologies for Alzheimer's disease, we explore the hypothesis that age-related myelin loss is an attractive explanation for age-associated cognitive decline and dementia. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of data in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database accompanied by quantitative histopathology of myelin and oligodendrocytes (OLs) in frontal cortices of 24 clinically characterized individuals. Pathological findings were further validated in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model and in culture. RESULTS: Myelin lesions increased with cognitive impairment in an amyloid-independent fashion with signs of degeneration appearing before neuronal loss. Myelinating OLs in the gray matter showed greater vulnerability than those in white matter, and the degenerative changes correlated with evidence of DNA damage. Similar results were found in myelinating OL cultures where DNA damage caused aberrant OL cell cycle re-entry and death. DISCUSSION: We present the first comprehensive analysis of the cell biology of early myelin loss in sporadic Alzheimer's disease.

29328927|t|Alzheimer's disease biomarker-guided diagnostic workflow using the added value of six combined cerebrospinal fluid candidates: Abeta1-42, total-tau, phosphorylated-tau, NFL, neurogranin, and YKL-40.
29328927|a|INTRODUCTION: The diagnostic and classificatory performances of all combinations of three core (amyloid beta peptide [i.e., Abeta1-42], total tau [t-tau], and phosphorylated tau) and three novel (neurofilament light chain protein, neurogranin, and YKL-40) cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of neurodegeneration were compared among individuals with mild cognitive impairment (n = 41), Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD; n = 35), frontotemporal dementia (FTD; n = 9), and cognitively healthy controls (HC; n = 21), using 10-fold cross-validation. METHODS: The combinations ranking in the top 10 according to diagnostic accuracy in differentiating between distinct diagnostic categories were identified. RESULTS: The single biomarkers or biomarker combinations generating the best area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROCs) were the following: the combination [amyloid beta peptide + phosphorylated tau + neurofilament light chain] for distinguishing between ADD patients and HC (AUROC = 0.86), t-tau for distinguishing between ADD and FTD patients (AUROC = 0.82), and t-tau for distinguishing between FTD patients and HC (AUROC = 0.78). CONCLUSIONS: Novel and established cerebrospinal fluid markers perform with at least fair accuracy in the discrimination between ADD and FTD. The classification of mild cognitive impairment individuals was poor.

In this study, we reported the first time that the genetic variants in the APBB2 gene were associated with use of amphetamine in opioid dependent patients undergoing methadone maintenance treatment (MMT). 344 heroin-dependent patients undergoing MMT were recruited and assessed for use of amphetamine and opioids by urine toxicology, withdrawal severity, and side effects. DNAs were genome-widely genotyped for all patients. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in APBB2 were selected for association analyses for methadone treatment responses. Gene expression levels of APBB2 were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the EBV-transformed lymphoblastoids from patients. MMT patients who used amphetamine showed a significantly higher percentage of positive results in the urine morphine test (P=0.005), and insomnia (P=0.018). In single locus association analyses, SNPs rs3935357 and rs4861075 located at intron 6 were significantly associated with amphetamine use in both genotype and allele type (general linear model (GLM), P=0.0003, and 0.0002 for genotype, and 0.0003, and 0.002 for allele type, respectively). The major allele type carriers had twice risk of amphetamine use compared to the minor allele type carriers. Subjects with the TT genotype of rs4861075 showed significantly higher levels of APBB2 gene expression in both total (P=0.02) and long-form (P=0.037) than those with CC genotype. Detailed mechanisms underlying the association of APBB2 with amphetamine use and level of plasma amyloid beta in MMT patients require further investigation.

29330470|t|beta-Ecdysterone protects SH-SY5Y cells against beta-amyloid-induced apoptosis via c-Jun N-terminal kinase- and Akt-associated complementary pathways.
29330470|a|Recently, the significantly higher incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in women than in men has been attributed to the loss of neuroprotective estrogen after menopause. Does phytoestrogen have the ability to protect against amyloid-beta (Abeta) toxicity? The aim of this study was to evaluate hypothesis that beta-ecdysterone (beta-Ecd) protects SH-SY5Y cells from Abeta-induced apoptosis by separate signaling pathways involving protein kinase B (Akt) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Here, we demonstrate that phytoestrogen beta-Ecd inhibits Abeta-triggered mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, as indicated by Bcl-2/Bax ratio elevation, cytochrome c (cyt c) release reduction, and caspase-9 inactivation. Interestingly, beta-Ecd upregulates Bcl-2 expression in SH-SY5Y cells under both basal and Abeta-challenged conditions, but downregulates Bax expression only in Abeta-challenged conditions. Subsequently, Akt-dependent NF-kappaB activation is required for Bcl-2 upregulation, but not Bax downregulation, in response to beta-Ecd, which was validated by the use of LY294002 and Bay11-7082. Notably, beta-Ecd attenuates the Abeta-evoked reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) phosphorylation and JNK activation without altering the basal ASK1 phosphorylation and JNK activation. ROS-scavenging by diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) abrogated the ability of beta-Ecd to alter the activation of ASK1. Simultaneously, inhibition of JNK by SP600125 abolished beta-Ecd-induced Bax downregulation in Abeta-challenged SH-SY5Y cells, whereas LY294002 failed to do so. Consequently, beta-Ecd possesses neuroprotection by different and complementary pathways, which together promote a Bcl-2/Bax ratio. These data support our hypothesis and suggest that beta-Ecd is a promising candidate for the treatment of AD.

29332037|t|Increased Vulnerability of the Hippocampus in Transgenic Mice Overexpressing APP and Triple Repeat Tau.
29332037|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common tauopathy, characterized by progressive accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and hyperphosphorylated tau. While pathology associated with the 4-repeat (4R) tau isoform is more abundant in corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy, both 3R and 4R tau isoforms accumulate in AD. Many studies have investigated interactions between Abeta and 4R tau in double transgenic mice, but few, if any, have examined the effects of Abeta with 3R tau. To examine this relationship, we crossed our APP751 mutant line with our recently characterized 3R tau mutant model to create a bigenic line (hAPP-3RTau) to model AD neuropathology. Mice were analyzed at 3 and 6 months of age for pathological and behavioral endpoints. While both the 3RTau and the hAPP-3RTau mice showed neuronal loss, increased tau aggregation, Abeta plaques and exhibited more behavioral deficits compared to the non-tg control, the bigenic mice often displaying relatively worsening levels. We found that even in young animals we found that the presence of APP/Abeta increased the accumulation of 3R tau in the neocortex and hippocampus. This observation was accompanied by activation of GSK3 and neurodegeneration in the neocortex and CA1 region. These results suggest that in addition to 4R tau, APP/Abeta may also enhance accumulation of 3R tau, a process which may be directly relevant to pathogenic pathways in AD. Our results demonstrate that this bigenic model closely parallels the pathological course of AD and may serve as a valuable model for testing new pharmacological interventions.

29332042|t|Protective Effects of Indian Spice Curcumin Against Amyloid-beta in Alzheimer's Disease.
29332042|a|The purpose of our article is to assess the current understanding of Indian spice, curcumin, against amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced toxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Natural products, such as ginger, curcumin, and gingko biloba have been used as diets and dietary supplements to treat human diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular, respiratory, infectious, diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndromes, and neurological disorders. Products derived from plants are known to have protective effects, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-arthritis, pro-healing, and boosting memory cognitive functions. In the last decade, several groups have designed and synthesized curcumin and its derivatives and extensively tested using cell and mouse models of AD. Recent research on Abeta and curcumin has revealed that curcumin prevents Abeta aggregation and crosses the blood-brain barrier, reach brain cells, and protect neurons from various toxic insults of aging and Abeta in humans. Recent research has also reported that curcumin ameliorates cognitive decline and improves synaptic functions in mouse models of AD. Further, recent groups have initiated studies on elderly individuals and patients with AD and the outcome of these studies is currently being assessed. This article highlights the beneficial effects of curcumin on AD. This article also critically assesses the current limitations of curcumin's bioavailability and urgent need for new formulations to increase its brain levels to treat patients with AD.

29332049|t|Free Heme and Amyloid-beta: A Fatal Liaison in Alzheimer's Disease.
29332049|a|While the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still unknown, an increased formation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide and oxidative processes are major pathological mechanism of the disease. The interaction of Abeta with free heme leads to the formation of peroxidase-active Abeta-heme complexes. However, enzyme-kinetic data and systematic mutational studies are still missing. These aspects were addressed in this study to evaluate the role of Abeta-heme complexes in AD. The enzyme-kinetic measurements showed peroxidase-specific pH- and H2O2-dependencies. In addition, the enzymatic activity of Abeta-heme complexes constantly increased at higher peptide excess. Moreover, the role of the Abeta sequence for the named enzymatic activity was tested, depicting human-specific R5, Y10, and H13 as essential amino acids. Also by studying Y10 as an endogenous peroxidase substrate for Abeta-heme complexes, ratio-specific effects were observed, showing an optimal dityrosine formation at an about 40-fold peptide excess. As dityrosine formation promotes Abeta fibrillation while free heme disturbs protein aggregation, we also investigated the effect of Abeta-heme complex-derived peroxidase activity on the formation of Abeta fibrils. The fluorescence measurements showed a different fibrillation behavior at strong peroxidase activity, leading also to altered fibril morphologies. The latter was detected by electron microscopy. As illustrated by selected in vivo measurements on a mouse model of AD, the disease is also characterized by Abeta-derived microvessel destructions and hemolytic processes. Thus, thrombo-hemorrhagic events are discussed as a source for free heme in brain tissue. In summary, we suggest the formation and enzymatic activity of Abeta-heme complexes as pathological key features of AD.

29334222|t|Online Preconcentration in Capillaries by Multiple Large-Volume Sample Stacking: An Alternative to Immunoassays for Quantification of Amyloid Beta Peptides Biomarkers in Cerebrospinal Fluid.
29334222|a|A novel electrokinetic preconcentration approach, so-called multiple pressure-assisted large-volume sample stacking with an electroosmotic flow pump (M-PA-LVSEP), was developed to allow in-capillary enrichment and separation of analytes from unlimited sample volumes. With this approach, the inherent limitation of in-capillary electrokinetic preconcentrations to the separation capillary volume can be overcome. The M-PA-LVSEP protocol relies on repeated cycles of pressure-assisted electroosmotic pumping and injection of extremely large sample volumes for analyte stacking and sample matrix removal. This technique was developed to address the challenge of sensitive and simultaneous determination of several amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides, which are biomarkers for the molecular diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). For the first time, reliable quantification of different species of fluorescently derivatized Abeta peptides, that is, Abeta 1-42, Abeta 1-40, and Abeta 1-38 down to subnanomolar ranges in cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) from AD and non-demented patients (healthy controls) was made possible without recourse to immunoassay, immunoprecipitation, or mass spectrometry approaches. Based on the stacking from a sample plug representing up to 400% of the total capillary volume, sensitive enhancement factors up to 170 could be achieved with this "antibody free" approach. Quantification limits for these Abeta peptides down to 0.05 nM with capillary electrophoresis coupled with laser-induced fluorescent detection could be obtained. Excellent agreement between results from M-PA-LVSEP and the gold standard ELISA method was achieved for measurements of Abeta 1-42 in CSF, with a determination correlation (r2) better than 0.993.

29335561|a|The atomic structure of the infectious, protease-resistant, beta-sheet-rich and fibrillar mammalian prion remains unknown. Through the cryo-EM method MicroED, we reveal the sub-angstrom-resolution structure of a protofibril formed by a wild-type segment from the beta2-alpha2 loop of the bank vole prion protein. The structure of this protofibril reveals a stabilizing network of hydrogen bonds that link polar zippers within a sheet, producing motifs we have named 'polar clasps'.

29337689|t|Abeta42 oligomers impair the bioenergetic activity in hippocampal synaptosomes derived from APP-KO mice.
29337689|a|Employing hippocampal synaptosomes from amyloid precursor protein (APP)-deleted mice we analyzed the immediate effects of amyloid beta peptide 42 (Abeta42) peptide in its oligomeric or fibrillar assembly or of soluble amyloid precursor protein alpha (sAPPalpha) protein on their bioenergetic activity. Upon administration of oligomeric Abeta42 peptide for 30 min we observed a robust decrease both in mitochondrial activity and in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). In contrast the respective fibrillary or scrambled peptides showed no effect, indicating that inhibition strictly depends on the oligomerization status of the peptide. Hippocampal synaptosomes from old APP-KO mice revealed a further reduction of their already impaired bioenergetic activity upon incubation with 10 mum Abeta42 peptide. In addition we evaluated the influence of the sAPPalpha protein on mitochondrial activity of hippocampal synaptosomes derived from young or old APP-KO animals. In neither case 20 nm nor 200 nm sAPPalpha protein had an effect on mitochondrial metabolic activity. Our findings demonstrate that hippocampal synaptosomes derived from APP-KO mice are a most suitable model system to evaluate the impact of Abeta42 peptide on its bioenergetic activity and to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the impairments by oligomeric Abeta42 on mitochondrial function. Our data demonstrate that extracellular Abeta42 peptide is taken up into synaptosomes where it immediately attenuates mitochondrial activity.

29339105|t|Effects of thymol on amyloid-beta-induced impairments in hippocampal synaptic plasticity in rats fed a high-fat diet.
29339105|a|Obesity and a high-fat diet (HFD) are known to increase the incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Oxidative stress, a major risk factor for AD, is increased with HFD consumption. Thymol (Thy) has antioxidant properties. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the protective and therapeutic effects of Thy on amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced impairments in the hippocampal synaptic plasticity of HFD-fed rats. In this study, 72 adult male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to 9 groups (n = 8 rats/group): Group 1 (control; standard diet); Group 2: Control + phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) + Oil (Thy vehicle); Group 3 (HFD + PBS); Group 4: (HFD + Abeta); Group 5: Control + PBS + Thy; Group 6: (HFD + Abeta + Oil); Group 7: Control + Abeta + Thy; Group 8: HFD + PBS + Thy; Group 9: (HFD + Abeta + Thy). After stereotaxic surgery, the field potentials were recorded after the implantation of the recording and stimulating electrodes in the dentate gyrus (DG) and perforant pathway, respectively. Following high-frequency stimulation, the long-term potentiation (LTP) of the population spike (PS) amplitude and the slope of the excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were measured in the DG. The HFD rats that received Abeta exhibited a significant decrease in their EPSP slope and PS amplitude as compared to the control group. In contrast, Thy administration in the HFD + Abeta rats reduced the decrease in the EPSP slope and PS amplitude. Thy decreased the Abeta-induced LTP impairments in HFD rats. The HFD significantly increased serum malondialdehyde levels and decreased total antioxidant capacity and total glutathione levels; whereas, Thy supplementation significantly reversed these parameters. Therefore, these results suggest that Thy, a natural antioxidant, can be therapeutic against high risk factors for AD, such as HFD.

29340569|t|Associations of the Top 20 Alzheimer Disease Risk Variants With Brain Amyloidosis.
29340569|a|Importance: Late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD) is highly heritable. Genome-wide association studies have identified more than 20 AD risk genes. The precise mechanism through which many of these genes are associated with AD remains unknown. Objective: To investigate the association of the top 20 AD risk variants with brain amyloidosis. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study analyzed the genetic and florbetapir F 18 data from 322 cognitively normal control individuals, 496 individuals with mild cognitive impairment, and 159 individuals with AD dementia who had genome-wide association studies and 18F-florbetapir positron emission tomographic data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), a prospective, observational, multisite tertiary center clinical and biomarker study. This ongoing study began in 2005. Main Outcomes and Measures: The study tested the association of AD risk allele carrier status (exposure) with florbetapir mean standard uptake value ratio (outcome) using stepwise multivariable linear regression while controlling for age, sex, and apolipoprotein E epsilon4 genotype. The study also reports on an exploratory 3-dimensional stepwise regression model using an unbiased voxelwise approach in Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 with cluster and significance thresholds at 50 voxels and uncorrected P < .01. Results: This study included 977 participants (mean [SD] age, 74 [7.5] years; 535 [54.8%] male and 442 [45.2%] female) from the ADNI-1, ADNI-2, and ADNI-Grand Opportunity. The adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette subfamily A member 7 (ABCA7) gene had the strongest association with amyloid deposition (chi2 = 8.38, false discovery rate-corrected P < .001), after apolioprotein E epsilon4. Significant associations were found between ABCA7 in the asymptomatic and early symptomatic disease stages, suggesting an association with rapid amyloid accumulation. The fermitin family homolog 2 (FERMT2) gene had a stage-dependent association with brain amyloidosis (FERMT2 x diagnosis chi2 = 3.53, false discovery rate-corrected P = .05), which was most pronounced in the mild cognitive impairment stage. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found an association of several AD risk variants with brain amyloidosis. The data also suggest that AD genes might differentially regulate AD pathologic findings across the disease stages.

29346778|t|Diverse Brain Myeloid Expression Profiles Reveal Distinct Microglial Activation States and Aspects of Alzheimer's Disease Not Evident in Mouse Models.
29346778|a|Microglia, the CNS-resident immune cells, play important roles in disease, but the spectrum of their possible activation states is not well understood. We derived co-regulated gene modules from transcriptional profiles of CNS myeloid cells of diverse mouse models, including new tauopathy model datasets. Using these modules to interpret single-cell data from an Alzheimer's disease (AD) model, we identified microglial subsets-distinct from previously reported "disease-associated microglia"-expressing interferon-related or proliferation modules. We then analyzed whole-tissue RNA profiles from human neurodegenerative diseases, including a new AD dataset. Correcting for altered cellular composition of AD tissue, we observed elevated expression of the neurodegeneration-related modules, but also modules not implicated using expression profiles from mouse models alone. We provide a searchable, interactive database for exploring gene expression in all these datasets (http://research-pub.gene.com/BrainMyeloidLandscape). Understanding the dimensions of CNS myeloid cell activation in human disease may reveal opportunities for therapeutic intervention.

29348604|t|Cromolyn Reduces Levels of the Alzheimer's Disease-Associated Amyloid beta-Protein by Promoting Microglial Phagocytosis.
29348604|a|Amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) deposition is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta deposition triggers both pro-neuroinflammatory microglial activation and neurofibrillary tangle formation. Cromolyn sodium is an asthma therapeutic agent previously shown to reduce Abeta levels in transgenic AD mouse brains after one-week of treatment. Here, we further explored these effects as well as the mechanism of action of cromolyn, alone, and in combination with ibuprofen in APPSwedish-expressing Tg2576 mice. Mice were treated for 3 months starting at 5 months of age, when the earliest stages of beta-amyloid deposition begin. Cromolyn, alone, or in combination with ibuprofen, almost completely abolished longer insoluble Abeta species, i.e. Abeta40 and Abeta42, but increased insoluble Abeta38 levels. In addition to its anti-aggregation effects on Abeta, cromolyn, alone, or plus ibuprofen, but not ibuprofen alone, increased microglial recruitment to, and phagocytosis of beta-amyloid deposits in AD mice. Cromolyn also promoted Abeta42 uptake in microglial cell-based assays. Collectively, our data reveal robust effects of cromolyn, alone, or in combination with ibuprofen, in reducing aggregation-prone Abeta levels and inducing a neuroprotective microglial activation state favoring Abeta phagocytosis versus a pro-neuroinflammatory state. These findings support the use of cromolyn, alone, or with ibuprofen, as a potential AD therapeutic.

29356535|t|Identification of a Novel Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Ligand for Imaging beta-Site Amyloid Precursor Protein Cleaving Enzyme 1 (BACE-1) in Brain.
29356535|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary tau tangles in the brain. beta-Site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) plays a key role in the generation of Abeta fragments via extracellular cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). We became interested in developing a BACE1 PET ligand to facilitate clinical assessment of BACE1 inhibitors and explore its potential in the profiling and selection of patients for AD trials. Using a set of PET ligand design parameters, compound 3 (PF-06684511) was rapidly identified as a lead with favorable in vitro attributes and structural handles for PET radiolabeling. Further evaluation in an LC-MS/MS "cold tracer" study in rodents revealed high specific binding to BACE1 in brain. Upon radiolabeling, [18F]3 demonstrated favorable brain uptake and high in vivo specificity in nonhuman primate (NHP), suggesting its potential for imaging BACE1 in humans.

Design, Setting, and Participants: The Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) was a randomized clinical trial in 6 centers across Finland (screening and randomization performed from September 7, 2009, through November 24, 2011; intervention duration, 2 years). Data analysis was performed from August 1, 2015, to March 31, 2016. The study population was at-risk older individuals from the general population. Inclusion criteria were age of 60 to 77 years; Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Dementia risk score of at least 6 points; and cognition at a mean level or slightly lower than expected for age. Individuals with dementia or substantial cognitive impairment and conditions that prevented cooperation or safe engagement in the intervention were excluded. APOE genotype data were available for 1175 of the 1260 participants. Interventions: Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to a multidomain intervention group (diet, exercise, cognitive training, and vascular risk management) or a control group (general health advice). Group allocation was not actively disclosed to participants, and outcome assessors were masked to group allocation. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was change in cognition measured through a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. Analysis was based on modified intention to treat (participants with at least 1 postbaseline assessment). Results: A total of 1109 participants (mean [SD] age, 69.3 [4.7] years; 514 [46.3%] female) were included in the analysis: 362 APOE epsilon4 allele carriers (173 intervention and 189 control) and 747 noncarriers (380 intervention and 367 control). The APOE epsilon4 carriers and noncarriers were not significantly different at baseline (except for serum cholesterol level). The difference between the intervention and control groups in annual neuropsychological test battery total score change was 0.037 (95% CI, 0.001 to 0.073) among carriers and 0.014 (95% CI, -0.011 to 0.039) among noncarriers. Intervention effect was not significantly different between carriers and noncarriers (0.023; 95% CI, -0.021 to 0.067). Conclusions and Relevance: Healthy lifestyle changes may be beneficial for cognition in older at-risk individuals even in the presence of APOE-related genetic susceptibility to dementia. Whether such benefits are more pronounced in APOE epsilon4 carriers compared with noncarriers should be further investigated. The findings also emphasize the importance of early prevention strategies that target multiple modifiable risk factors simultaneously. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01041989.

29357117|t|Crocin improved amyloid beta induced long-term potentiation and memory deficits in the hippocampal CA1 neurons in freely moving rats.
29357117|a|Extracellular beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation and deposition is the main factor, which causes synaptic loss and eventually cells death in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Memory loss and long-term potentiation (LTP) dysfunction in the hippocampus are involved in the AD. The involvement of crocin, as the main and active constituent of saffron extract in learning and memory processes, has been proposed. Here we investigated the probable therapeutic effect of crocin on memory, LTP, and neuronal apoptosis using in vivo Abeta models of the AD. The Abeta peptide (1-42) was bilaterally administered into the frontal-cortex using stereotaxic apparatus. Five hours after surgery, rats were given intraperitoneal crocin (30 mg/kg) daily, which repeated for 12 days. Barnes maze results showed that administration of crocin significantly improves spatial memory indicators such as latency time to achieving the target hole and the number of errors when compared to Abeta-group. Passive avoidance test revealed that crocin significantly increased the step-through-latency compared to Abeta-treated alone. These learning deficits in Abeta-treated animals correlated with a reduction of LTP in hippocampal CA1 synapses in freely moving rats, which crocin improved population spike amplitude and mean field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) slope reduction induced by Abeta. Neuronal apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay and the expression levels of c-Fos proteins were examined by Western blotting. Crocin significantly reduced the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the CA1 region and decreased c-Fos in the hippocampus compared to Abeta-group. In vivo Abeta treatment altered significantly the electrophysiological properties of CA1 neurons and crocin further confirmed a neuroprotective action against Abeta toxicity.

29357242|t|Out-of-Register Abeta42 Assemblies as Models for Neurotoxic Oligomers and Fibrils.
29357242|a|We propose a variant of the recently found S-shaped Abeta1-42-motif that is characterized by out-of-register C-terminal beta-strands. We show that chains with this structure can form not only fibrils that are compatible with the NMR signals but also barrel-shaped oligomers that resemble the ones formed by the much smaller cylindrin peptides. By running long all-atom molecular dynamics simulations at physiological temperatures with an explicit solvent, we study the stability of these constructs and show that they are plausible models for neurotoxic oligomers. After analyzing the transitions between different assemblies, we suggest a mechanism for amyloid formation in Alzheimer's disease.

29357799|t|Estimating Alzheimer's Disease Progression Rates from Normal Cognition Through Mild Cognitive Impairment and Stages of Dementia.
29357799|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) can be conceptualized as a continuum: patients progress from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD, followed by increasing severity of AD dementia. Prior research has measured transition probabilities among later stages of AD, but not for the complete spectrum. OBJECTIVE: To estimate annual progression rates across the AD continuum and evaluate the impact of a delay in MCI due to AD on the trajectory of AD dementia and clinical outcomes. METHODS: Patient-level longitudinal data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center for n=18,103 patients with multiple visits over the age of 65 were used to estimate annual, age-specific transitional probabilities between normal cognition, MCI due to AD, and AD severity states (defined by Clinical Dementia Rating score). Multivariate models predicted the likelihood of death and institutionalization for each health state, conditional on age and time from the previous evaluation. These probabilities were used to populate a transition matrix describing the likelihood of progressing to a particular disease state or death for any given current state and age. Finally, a health state model was developed to estimate the expected effect of a reduction in the risk of transitioning from normal cognition to MCI due to AD on disease progression rates for a cohort of 65-year-old patients over a 35-year time horizon. RESULTS: Annual transition probabilities to more severe states were 8%, 22%, 25%, 36%, and 16% for normal cognition, MCI due to AD, and mild/moderate/severe AD, respectively, at age 65, and increased as a function of age. Progression rates from normal cognition to MCI due to AD ranged from 4% to 10% annually. Severity of cognitive impairment and age both increased the likelihood of institutionalization and death. For a cohort of 100 patients with normal cognition at age 65, a 20% reduction in the annual progression rate to MCI due to AD avoided 5.7 and 5.6 cases of MCI due to AD and AD, respectively. This reduction led to less time spent in severe AD dementia health states and institutionalized, and increased life expectancy. CONCLUSION: Transition probabilities from normal cognition through AD severity states are important for understanding patient progression across the AD spectrum. These estimates can be used to evaluate the clinical benefits of reducing progression from normal cognition to MCI due to AD on lifetime health outcomes.

29362733|t|Probing beta amyloid aggregation using fluorescence anisotropy: experiments and simulation.
29362733|a|The aggregation of beta amyloid (Ab) protein is associated with the development of Alzheimer's disease. In this work we monitor Ab aggregation using fluorescence anisotropy, a technique that provides information on the rotational diffusion of the fluorescing tyrosine (Tyr) side chains. We also perform Monte Carlo (MC) and fully atomistic Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to interpret the experiments. The experimental results show that there are two different rotational timescales contributing to the anisotropy. Our MC simulation captures this behaviour in a coarse-scale manner, and, more importantly, shows that the Tyr side chains must have their movements restricted in order to reproduce the anisotropy. The MD simulations provide a molecular scale view, and indeed show that aggregation restricts the Try side chains to yield anisotropy in line with the experimental results. This combination of experiment and simulation therefore provides a unique insight into the aggregation process, and we suggest how this approach might be used to gain further information on aggregating protein systems.

29362997|t|TREM2 Ameliorates Neuronal Tau Pathology Through Suppression of Microglial Inflammatory Response.
29362997|a|As a recently identified susceptibility gene for Alzheimer's disease (AD), triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) encodes an immune receptor that is uniquely expressed on microglia, functioning as a modulator of microglial functions including phagocytosis and inflammatory response. Several lines of evidence suggest that TREM2 is upregulated and positively correlates with tau pathology in the brains of AD patients. Meanwhile, our recent study showed that knockdown of TREM2 markedly exacerbated neuronal tau hyperphosphorylation in the brains of P301S-tau transgenic mice, implying that TREM2 might exert a protective role against tau pathology under AD context. However, the precise mechanisms underlying this observation remain largely unclear. In this study, by employing a microglial-neuronal co-culture model, we showed that microglial inflammatory response induced by lipopolysaccharide led to tau hyperphosphorylation in neurons via activation of a major tau kinase glycogen synthase kinase 3beta, confirming the pathogenic effects of activated microglia on the progression of tau pathology. More importantly, by manipulating TREM2 levels in microglia with a lentiviral-mediated strategy, we demonstrated that TREM2 ameliorated the pathological effects of activated microglia on neuronal tau hyperphosphorylation via suppression of microglial inflammatory response. Taken together, these findings uncover the underlying mechanisms by which TREM2 protects against tau pathology and highlight TREM2 as a potential therapeutic target for AD.

29368044|t|Analysis of novel endosome-to-Golgi retrieval genes reveals a role for PLD3 in regulating endosomal protein sorting and amyloid precursor protein processing.
29368044|a|The processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) to the neurotoxic pro-aggregatory Abeta peptide is controlled by the mechanisms that govern the trafficking and localisation of APP. We hypothesised that genes involved in endosomal protein sorting could play an important role in regulating APP processing and, therefore, analysed ~ 40 novel endosome-to-Golgi retrieval genes previously identified in a genome-wide siRNA screen. We report that phospholipase D3 (PLD3), a type II membrane protein, functions in endosomal protein sorting and plays an important role in regulating APP processing. PLD3 co-localises with APP in endosomes and loss of PLD3 function results in reduced endosomal tubules, impaired trafficking of several membrane proteins and reduced association of sortilin-like 1 with APP.

29369398|t|Neutrophil hyperactivation correlates with Alzheimer's disease progression.
29369398|a|OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have underlined the effect of systemic inflammation on the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neutrophils are key components of early innate immunity and contribute to uncontrolled systemic inflammation if not tightly regulated. The aim of our study was to fully characterize human circulating neutrophils at different disease stages in AD. METHODS: We analyzed neutrophil phenotypes and functions in 42 patients with AD (16 with mild cognitive impairment and 26 with dementia), and compared them to 22 age-matched healthy subjects. This study was performed directly in whole blood to avoid issues with data interpretation related to cell isolation procedures. RESULTS: Blood samples from AD patients with dementia revealed neutrophil hyperactivation associated with increased reactive oxygen species production and increased levels of intravascular neutrophil extravascular traps. The homeostasis of circulating neutrophils in these patients also changed: The ratio between the harmful hyperreactive CXCR4high /CD62Llow senescent and the CD16bright /CD62Ldim immunosuppressive neutrophil subsets rose in the later stage of the disease. These abnormalities were greater in fast-decliner than in slow-decliner patients. INTERPRETATION: Our results indicate that the inflammatory properties of circulating neutrophils shift as the percentage of aged neutrophils expands in patients with AD-changes that may play an instrumental role in establishing systemic chronic inflammation. Most important, our data strongly suggest that the neutrophil phenotype may be associated with the rate of cognitive decline and may thus constitute an innovative and prognostic blood biomarker in patients with AD.

29372182|t|Stereochemistry and amyloid inhibition: Asymmetric triplex metallohelices enantioselectively bind to Abeta peptide.
29372182|a|Stereochemistry is vital for pharmaceutical development and can determine drug efficacy. Herein, 10 pairs of asymmetric triplex metallohelix enantiomers as a library were used to screen inhibitors of amyloid beta (Abeta) aggregation via a fluorescent cell-based high-throughput method. Intriguingly, Lambda enantiomers show a stronger inhibition effect than Delta enantiomers. In addition, the metallohelices with aromatic substituents are more effective than those without, revealing that these groups play a key role in the Abeta interaction. Fluorescence stopped-flow kinetic studies indicate that binding of the Lambda enantiomer to Abeta is much faster than that of the Delta enantiomer. Furthermore, studies in enzyme digestion, isothermal titration calorimetry, nuclear magnetic resonance, and computational docking demonstrate that the enantiomers bind to the central hydrophobic alpha-helical region of Abeta13-23, although with different modes for the Lambda and Delta enantiomers. Finally, an in vivo study showed that these metallohelices extend the life span of the Caenorhabditis elegans CL2006 strain by attenuating Abeta-induced toxicity. Our work will shed light on the design and screening of a metal complex as an amyloid inhibitor against Alzheimer's disease.

29376865|t|Associations of Dietary Protein and Fiber Intake with Brain and Blood Amyloid-beta.
29376865|a|Accumulating evidence suggests a diet high in protein and fiber may confer some protection against Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, no human studies to-date have assessed the relationship between protein and fiber intake, and plasma and brain amyloid-beta (Abeta). Consequently, this cross-sectional study, investigated the association of self-reported dietary intakes of protein and fiber, with plasma and brain Abeta burden (n = 541, and n = 162 respectively), in a well-characterized cohort of cognitively normal older adults, drawn from the larger Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study of aging. We observed 12.59 and 8.43 higher odds of 'high' brain Abeta burden (PiB PET SUVR>=1.5) if protein intake fell in the lowest and middle tertile, respectively, compared to the highest tertile (p = 0.008; p = 0.013). Thus, in this cohort, the more protein consumed, the less likelihood of 'high' Abeta burden in the brain. No other significant associations were observed. The results of this study highlight the potentially protective impact of high dietary protein intake on brain Abeta burden in older adults, before objective memory decline is apparent. While longitudinal validation is required, these findings may assist in the development of dietary approaches aimed at preventing or delaying AD onset.

29376870|t|Assay of Plasma Phosphorylated Tau Protein (Threonine 181) and Total Tau Protein in Early-Stage Alzheimer's Disease.
29376870|a|The feasibility of assaying plasma phosphorylated tau protein (threonine 181), denoted p-tau181, using immunomagnetic reduction (IMR) is explored. The reagent for assaying p-tau181 with IMR was synthesized, and its analytic performances were characterized. Seventy-three subjects were recruited. Each participant was examined with neuropsychological tests, magnetic resonance imaging, and IMR assay for plasma p-tau181. Using commercially available IMR kits, the plasma total tau protein (T-tau) of each subject was assayed. The dynamic range for assaying p-tau181 using IMR was 1.96x10-2 pg/ml to 104 pg/ml. There was no significant interference from total tau protein in the assay of p-tau181. The measured concentrations of plasma p-tau181 were 2.46+-1.09 pg/ml for healthy controls, 4.41+-1.85 pg/ml for MCI due to AD, and 6.14+-1.59 pg/ml for very mild AD. Meanwhile, the measured concentrations of plasma T-tau were 18.85+-10.16 pg/ml for healthy controls, 32.98+-10.18 pg/ml for MCI due to AD, and 37.54+-12.29 pg/ml for very mild AD. A significant difference in plasma p-tau181 was observed between healthy controls and MCI due to AD (p < 0.001) and between MCI due to AD and very mild AD (p < 0.001). However, for the plasma T-tau concentration, a significant difference existed only between healthy controls and MCI due to AD (p < 0.001). This implies that the plasma p-tau181 level is correlated more to AD severity than plasma T-tau is. Additionally, p-tau181 was observed as approximately 14% of T-tau in human plasma.

29376876|t|Endogenous Murine Amyloid-beta Peptide Assembles into Aggregates in the Aged C57BL/6J Mouse Suggesting These Animals as a Model to Study Pathogenesis of Amyloid-beta Plaque Formation.
29376876|a|Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), paired helical filament-tau (PHF-tau), and alpha-synuclein are in the focus of neuroscience research because they aggregate in brains of patients with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. For this purpose, transgenic mouse models were used containing the human genes for AbetaPP/presenilin/tau or alpha-synuclein with the most frequent mutations. This is not ideal because most patients develop sporadic forms of the diseases with no causative single gene defect and furthermore the aggregation of human proteins in man is not necessarily the same in rodents. We hypothesized that for such cases the aged mouse could be an alternative model and analyzed the distribution of endogenous Abeta, PHF-tau, and alpha-synuclein in mouse brains at different ages. Whereas Abeta was below detectable levels at birth, it was present at high levels in the 15-month-old mouse. Abeta was found in the cytosol and lysosomes of neurons of the temporal cortex, cingulate area, pons, and cerebellum as well as extracellularly in the periventricular zone. Contrary to Abeta, mouse brain was devoid of PHF-tau-positive neurofibrillary tangles. alpha-Synuclein was detectable in the newborn mouse with highest levels in the marginal zone of the lateral cortex and average levels in the hippocampus, pons, and cerebellum. Brain-area specific differences in the alpha-synuclein level persisted up to 15 months of age, but increased 3-fold in all areas over time. alpha-Synuclein resided in the neuropil, but not in intracellular aggregates even in the aged mouse. We suggest the aged mouse as a model to study Abeta plaque formation.

29376878|t|A Longitudinal Study of Total and Phosphorylated alpha-Synuclein with Other Biomarkers in Cerebrospinal Fluid of Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment.
29376878|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) features a dynamic sequence of amyloid deposition, neurodegeneration, and cognitive impairment. A significant fraction of AD brains also displays Lewy body pathology, suggesting that addition of classically Parkinson's disease-related proteins to the AD biomarker panel may be of value. To determine whether addition of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) total alpha-synuclein and its form phosphorylated at S129 (pS129) to the AD biomarker panel [Amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta42), tau, and phosphorylated tau (p-tau181)] improves its performance, we examined CSF samples collected longitudinally up to 7 years as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. From 87 AD, 177 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 104 age-matched healthy controls, 792 baseline and longitudinal CSF samples were tested for total alpha-synuclein, pS129, Abeta42, tau, and p-tau181. pS129, but not total alpha-synuclein, was weakly associated with diagnosis at baseline when t-tau/Abeta42 was included in the statistical model (beta= 0.0026, p = 0.041, 95% CI [(0.0001)-(0.005)]). CSF alpha-synuclein predicted Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (beta= -0.59, p = 0.0015, 95% CI [(-0.96)-(-0.23)]), memory (beta= 0.4, p = 0.00025, 95% CI [(0.16)-(0.59)]), and executive (0.62,<0.0001, 95% CI [(0.31)-(0.93)]) function composite scores, and progression from MCI to AD (beta= 0.019, p = 0.0011, 95% CI [(0.002)-(0.20)]). pS129 was associated with executive function (beta= -2.55, p = 0.0085, 95% CI [(-4.45)-(-0.66)]). Lower values in the mismatch between alpha-synuclein and p-tau181 predicted faster cognitive decline (beta= 0.64, p = 0.0012, 95% CI [(0.48)-(0.84)]). Longitudinal biomarker changes did not differ between groups, and may not reflect AD progression. The alpha-synuclein-p-tau181-Mismatch could better predict longitudinal cognitive changes than classical AD markers alone, and its pathological correlates should be investigated further.

29377008|t|Blood-brain barrier breakdown in Alzheimer disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.
29377008|a|The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a continuous endothelial membrane within brain microvessels that has sealed cell-to-cell contacts and is sheathed by mural vascular cells and perivascular astrocyte end-feet. The BBB protects neurons from factors present in the systemic circulation and maintains the highly regulated CNS internal milieu, which is required for proper synaptic and neuronal functioning. BBB disruption allows influx into the brain of neurotoxic blood-derived debris, cells and microbial pathogens and is associated with inflammatory and immune responses, which can initiate multiple pathways of neurodegeneration. This Review discusses neuroimaging studies in the living human brain and post-mortem tissue as well as biomarker studies demonstrating BBB breakdown in Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, HIV-1-associated dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. The pathogenic mechanisms by which BBB breakdown leads to neuronal injury, synaptic dysfunction, loss of neuronal connectivity and neurodegeneration are described. The importance of a healthy BBB for therapeutic drug delivery and the adverse effects of disease-initiated, pathological BBB breakdown in relation to brain delivery of neuropharmaceuticals are briefly discussed. Finally, future directions, gaps in the field and opportunities to control the course of neurological diseases by targeting the BBB are presented.

29378005|t|Tau Oligomer Pathology in Nucleus Basalis Neurons During the Progression of Alzheimer Disease.
29378005|a|Although tau is the primary constituent of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), evidence suggests that its toxic moiety is oligomeric in Alzheimer disease (AD). In this regard, tau oligomers correlate more strongly with neuronal loss than NFTs and exhibit neurotoxicity in preclinical AD models. Here, we investigated the spatiotemporal progression of oligomeric tau accumulation within the highly vulnerable cholinergic neurons of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM) in AD. Tissue from subjects who died with a clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment, or AD was immunostained with the tau oligomeric complex 1 (TOC1) antibody, a marker of tau oligomers, and p75NTR, a cholinergic cell marker. Stereological estimates revealed a significant increase in the number of TOC1 nbM immunopositive (+) neurons with a concomitant decrease in p75NTR+ nbM neurons during the transition from mild cognitive impairment to AD. Immunofluorescence identified TOC1+ neurons that colocalized with the pretangle tau marker phospho-Ser422, which persisted into late stage NFTs immunoreactive for MN423. Analysis of the nbM subfields revealed a topographical caudal to rostral gradient of TOC1+ neurons during disease progression. Taken together, these data suggest that toxic tau oligomers accumulate caudorostrally in selectively vulnerable nbM neurons during the onset of AD.

29378302|t|Amyloid-beta oligomers synaptotoxicity: The emerging role of EphA4/c-Abl signaling in Alzheimer's disease.
29378302|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive memory loss and dementia. The strong correlation between cognitive decline and the loss of synapses supports the idea that synaptic damage is a relevant pathogenic mechanism underlying AD progression. It has been shown that amyloid beta oligomers (AbetaOs) induce synaptotoxicity ultimately leading to the reduction of dendritic spine density, which underlies cognitive damage. However, the signaling pathways connecting AbetaOs to synaptic dysfunction have not been completely elucidated. In this review, we have gathered evidence on AbetaOs receptors and the signaling pathways involved in synaptic damage. We make special emphasis on a new AbetaOs induced axis that involves the tyrosine kinase ephrin receptor A4 (EphA4) and c-Abl tyrosine kinase activation. EphA4 is a key player in homeostatic plasticity, mediating dendritic spine remodeling and retraction. AbetaOs aberrantly activate EphA4 leading to dendritic spine elimination. c-Abl is activated in AbetaOs exposed neurons and in AD patient's brain, and the inhibition of activated c-Abl ameliorates cognitive deficits in AD mouse model. The EphA4 receptor activates c-Abl intracellular signaling. Therefore EphA4 is an emerging AbetaOs receptor and the activation of the EphA4/c-Abl axis would explain the synaptic spine alterations found in AD.

29378960|t|Lysosomal enzyme tripeptidyl peptidase 1 destabilizes fibrillar Abeta by multiple endoproteolytic cleavages within the beta-sheet domain.
29378960|a|Accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta), which is associated with Alzheimer's disease, can be caused by excess production or insufficient clearance. Because of its beta-sheet structure, fibrillar Abeta is resistant to proteolysis, which would contribute to slow degradation of Abeta plaques in vivo. Fibrillar Abeta can be internalized by microglia, which are the scavenger cells of the brain, but the fibrils are degraded only slowly in microglial lysosomes. Cathepsin B is a lysosomal protease that has been shown to proteolyze fibrillar Abeta. Tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1), a lysosomal serine protease, possesses endopeptidase activity and has been shown to cleave peptides between hydrophobic residues. Herein, we demonstrate that TPP1 is able to proteolyze fibrillar Abeta efficiently. Mass spectrometry analysis of peptides released from fibrillar Abeta digested with TPP1 reveals several endoproteolytic cleavages including some within beta-sheet regions that are important for fibril formation. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that these cleavages destabilize fibrillar beta-sheet structure. The demonstration that TPP1 can degrade fibrillar forms of Abeta provides insight into the turnover of fibrillar Abeta and may lead to new therapeutic methods to increase degradation of Abeta plaques.

29379963|t|Circadian Rest-Activity Pattern Changes in Aging and Preclinical Alzheimer Disease.
29379963|a|Importance: Circadian rhythm disturbances occur in symptomatic Alzheimer disease (AD) and have been hypothesized to contribute to disease pathogenesis. However, it is unknown whether circadian changes occur during the presymptomatic phase of the disease. Objective: To examine the associations between circadian function, aging, and preclinical AD pathology in cognitively normal adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study was conducted using community volunteers from the Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at Washington University in St Louis. Cognitively normal participants (n = 205) underwent 7 to 14 days of actigraphy in their home environment between 2010 and 2012, in addition to clinical assessment, amyloid imaging with Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB), and cerebrospinal fluid biomarker collection. Data collected from 3 years before to 6 months after actigraphy were included. Sixteen participants were excluded owing to incomplete data collection. Main Outcomes and Measures: Circadian rhythm analysis was performed on actigraphy data using 3 methods: cosinor, nonparametric, and empirical mode decomposition. Preclinical AD was assessed by longitudinal clinical assessment, amyloid imaging with PiB, and cerebrospinal fluid biomarker collection. Results: Data from 189 participants were included in the analyses. The mean (SD) age was 66.6 (8.3) years, and 121 participants (64%) were women. Older age (beta = .247; P = .003) and male sex (beta = .170; P = .04), in the absence of amyloid pathology, were associated with a significant increase in intradaily variability, a nonparametric measure of rest-activity rhythm fragmentation, as well as decreased amplitude by several measures. After correction for age and sex, the presence of preclinical amyloid plaque pathology, assessed by positive PiB imaging (mean [SD], 0.804 [0.187] for PiB negative vs 0.875 [0.178] for PiB positive; P = .05) or increasing cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated-tau to amyloid beta 42 ratio (beta = .231; P = .008), was associated with increased intradaily variability, indicating rest-activity rhythm fragmentation. Conclusions and Relevance: Preclinical AD is associated with rest-activity rhythm fragmentation, independent of age or sex. Aging was also associated with circadian dysfunction independently of preclinical AD pathology, particularly in men. The presence of circadian rhythm abnormalities in the preclinical phase of AD suggests that circadian dysfunction could contribute to early disease pathogenesis or serve as a biomarker of preclinical disease.

29380450|t|Fibrillization of beta-Amyloid Peptides via Chemically Modulated Pathway.
29380450|a|The aggregation of beta-amyloid peptides is closely associated with Alzheimer's disease. We have used liposomes to modulate the early aggregation events of 40-residue beta-amyloid peptides. The spatial confinement provided by liposomes leads to the formation of nonfibrillar aggregates of beta-amyloid peptides. These on-pathway beta-sheet intermediates were used to seed the fibrillization of the monomer peptides. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy revealed that the resultant fibrils have a more uniform structure than those formed in liposome-free solution.

29380494|t|Effect of pH on Abeta42 Monomer and Fibril-like Oligomers-Decoding in Silico of the Roles of pK Values of Charged Residues.
29380494|a|Amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) is the key to developing Alzheimer's disease. Experiments have confirmed that different acidity influences directly not only the structural morphology and population of Abeta oligomers, but also the toxicity. The atomic-level association between the pH, charged residues, and Abeta properties remains obscure. Herein, conformational changes of Abeta42 monomer, fibril-like trimer, and pentamer in the medium pH range of 4.0-7.5 are studied. The results reveal that, as the pH changes from 7.5 to the isoelectric pH, His6, His13, and His14 are protonated in turn, successively approach the center of mass of folded Abeta monomer, trigger ionic interactions and changes of neighboring turns (Asp7-Ser8, His14-Lys16) and even a distant one (Leu34-Met35), as well as concomitant changes of secondary structure, and promote the conformation transition from unfolded to folded. This observation discloses that protonation can convert these charged residues from originally hydrophilic to "hydrophobic-like". For fibril-like oligomers, the pH susceptibility essentially stems from the pK values of charged residues in the context of the Abeta fibril, and in turn one can predict the dynamic behavior of these residues in the processes of dissociation or stabilization of a fibril by comparing the pK values of residues involved in salt bridges in the normal state with those in the current context. This idea is justified by two fibril models and appears to be applicable to other peptides and their fibril systems.

29380913|t|Review: Vascular dementia: clinicopathologic and genetic considerations.
29380913|a|The incidence and severity of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) increase with advancing age, as does the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Not surprisingly, heterogeneous forms of CVD may coexist with AD changes in the 'ageing brain'. These include angiopathies (affecting both large and small arteries) that result from 'classical' risk factors (hypertension, smoking and diabetes) and others (cerebral amyloid angiopathy) that are biochemically closely linked to AD. The morphologic consequences of these various vascular diseases are infarcts and/or haemorrhages of varying sizes within the brain, which lead to neurocognitive decline that may mimic AD - though the vascular abnormalities are usually detectable by neuroimaging. More subtle effects of CVD may include neuroinflammation and biochemical 'lesions' that have no reliable morphologic correlate and thus escape the attention of even an experienced Neuropathologist. The pathogenesis of hippocampal injury resembling ischaemic change - commonly seen in the brains of geriatric subjects - remains controversial. In recent years, genetically determined forms of microangiopathy (e.g. CADASIL, CARASIL, Trex1-related microangiopathies, CARASAL, familial forms of cerebral amyloid angiopathy or CAA) have provided interesting cellular and molecular clues to the pathogenesis of sporadic microvascular disease such as arteriolosclerosis and AD-related CAA.

29382695|t|Regulation of amyloid-beta dynamics and pathology by the circadian clock.
29382695|a|Nighttime restlessness and daytime drowsiness are common and early symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). This symptomology implicates dysfunctional biological timing, yet the role of the circadian system in AD pathogenesis is unknown. To evaluate the role of the circadian clock in amyloid-beta (Abeta) dynamics and pathology, we used a mouse model of beta-amyloidosis and disrupted circadian clock function either globally or locally in the brain via targeted deletion of the core clock gene Bmal1 Our results demonstrate that loss of central circadian rhythms leads to disruption of daily hippocampal interstitial fluid Abeta oscillations and accelerates amyloid plaque accumulation, whereas loss of peripheral Bmal1 in the brain parenchyma increases expression of Apoe and promotes fibrillar plaque deposition. These results provide evidence that both central circadian rhythms and local clock function influence Abeta dynamics and plaque formation and demonstrate mechanisms by which poor circadian hygiene may directly influence AD pathogenesis.

29384229|t|Computational Study of the Aza-Michael Addition of the Flavonoid (+)-Taxifolin in the Inhibition of beta-Amyloid Fibril Aggregation.
29384229|a|Inhibition of abnormal protein self-aggregation is an attractive strategy against amyloidogenic diseases, but has found limited success due to the complexity of protein self-assembly, the absence of fully reproducible aggregation assays, and the scarce knowledge of the inhibition mechanisms by small molecules. In this context, catechol-containing compounds may lead to covalent adducts with amyloid fibrils that interfere with the aggregation process. In particular, the covalent adduct formed between the oxidized form of (+)-taxifolin and an beta-amyloid (Abeta42) suggests the involvement of a specific recognition motif that enables the chemical reaction with Abeta42. In this study, we have examined the mechanisms implicated in the aza-Michael addition of the o-quinone species of (+)-taxifolin with Abeta42 fibrils. The results support the binding of (+)-taxifolin to the hydrophobic groove delimited by the edges defined by Lys16 and Glu22 residues in the fibril. The chemical reaction proceeds through the nucleophilic attack of the deprotonated amino group of a Lys16 residue in a process activated by the interaction between the o-quinone ring with a vicinal Lys16 residue, as well as by a water-assisted proton transfer, which is the rate-limiting step of the reaction. This specific inhibition mechanism, which may explain the enhanced anti-aggregating activity of oxidized flavonoids compared to fresh compounds, holds promise for developing disease-modifying therapies.

29385058|t|A Systematic Review of Antiamyloidogenic and Metal-Chelating Peptoids: Two Structural Motifs for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.
29385058|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable form of dementia affecting millions of people worldwide and costing billions of dollars in health care-related payments, making the discovery of a cure a top health, societal, and economic priority. Peptide-based drugs and immunotherapies targeting AD-associated beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregation have been extensively explored; however, their therapeutic potential is limited by unfavorable pharmacokinetic (PK) properties. Peptoids (N-substituted glycine oligomers) are a promising class of peptidomimetics with highly tunable secondary structures and enhanced stabilities and membrane permeabilities. In this review, the biological activities, structures, and physicochemical properties for several amyloid-targeting peptoids will be described. In addition, metal-chelating peptoids with the potential to treat AD will be discussed since there are connections between the dysregulation of certain metals and the amyloid pathway.

29388083|t|18F-FPYBF-2, a new F-18-labelled amyloid imaging PET tracer: first experience in 61 volunteers and 55 patients with dementia.
29388083|a|OBJECTIVE: Recently, we developed a benzofuran derivative for the imaging of beta-amyloid plaques, 5-(5-(2-(2-(2-18F-fluoroethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)benzofuran-2-yl)-N-methylpyridin-2-amine (18F-FPYBF-2) (Ono et al., J Med Chem 54:2971-9, 2011). The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of 18F-FPYBF-2 as an amyloid imaging PET tracer in a first clinical study with healthy volunteers and patients with various dementia and in comparative dual tracer study using 11C-Pittsburgh Compound B (11C-PiB). METHODS: 61 healthy volunteers (age: 53.7 +- 13.1 years old; 19 male and 42 female; age range 24-79) and 55 patients with suspected dementia [Alzheimer's Disease (AD); early AD: n = 19 and moderate stage AD: n = 8, other dementia: n = 9, mild cognitive impairment (MCI): n = 16, cognitively normal: n = 3] for first clinical study underwent static head PET/CT scan using 18 F - FPYBF-2 at 50-70 min after injection. 13 volunteers and 14 patients also underwent dynamic PET scan at 0-50 min at the same instant. 16 subjects (volunteers: n = 5, patients with dementia: n = 11) (age: 66.3 +- 14.2 years old; 10 males and 6 females) were evaluated for comparative study (50-70 min after injection) using 18F-FPYBF-2 and 11C-PiB on separate days, respectively. Quantitative analysis of mean cortical uptake was calculated using Mean Cortical Index of SUVR (standardized uptake value ratio) based on the established method for 11C-PiB analysis using cerebellar cortex as control. RESULTS: Studies with healthy volunteers showed that 18F-FPYBF-2 uptake was mainly observed in cerebral white matter and that average Mean Cortical Index at 50-70 min was low and stable (1.066 +- 0.069) basically independent from age or gender. In patients with AD, 18F-FPYBF-2 uptake was observed both in cerebral white and gray matter, and Mean Cortical Index was significantly higher (early AD: 1.288 +- 0.134, moderate AD: 1.342 +- 0.191) than those of volunteers and other dementia (1.018 +- 0.057). In comparative study, the results of 18F-FPYBF-2 PET/CT were comparable with those of 11C-PiB, and the Mean Cortical Index (18F-FPYBF-2: 1.173 +- 0.215; 11C-PiB: 1.435 +- 0.474) showed direct proportional relationship with each other (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Our first clinical study suggest that 18F-FPYBF-2 is a useful PET tracer for the evaluation of beta-amyloid deposition and that quantitative analysis of Mean Cortical Index of SUVR is a reliable diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of AD.

29389750|t|18F-florbetapir Positron Emission Tomography-determined Cerebral beta-Amyloid Deposition and Neurocognitive Performance after Cardiac Surgery.
29389750|a|BACKGROUND: Amyloid deposition is a potential contributor to postoperative cognitive dysfunction. The authors hypothesized that 6-week global cortical amyloid burden, determined by F-florbetapir positron emission tomography, would be greater in those patients manifesting cognitive dysfunction at 6 weeks postoperatively. METHODS: Amyloid deposition was evaluated in cardiac surgical patients at 6 weeks (n = 40) and 1 yr (n = 12); neurocognitive function was assessed at baseline (n = 40), 6 weeks (n = 37), 1 yr (n = 13), and 3 yr (n = 9). The association of 6-week amyloid deposition with cognitive dysfunction was assessed by multivariable regression, accounting for age, years of education, and baseline cognition. Differences between the surgical cohort with cognitive deficit and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohorts (normal and early/late mild cognitive impairment) was assessed, adjusting for age, education, and apolipoprotein E4 genotype. RESULTS: The authors found that 6-week abnormal global cortical amyloid deposition was not associated with cognitive dysfunction (13 of 37, 35%) at 6 weeks postoperatively (median standard uptake value ratio [interquartile range]: cognitive dysfunction 0.92 [0.89 to 1.07] vs. 0.98 [0.93 to 1.05]; P = 0.455). In post hoc analyses, global cortical amyloid was also not associated with cognitive dysfunction at 1 or 3 yr postoperatively. Amyloid deposition at 6 weeks in the surgical cohort was not different from that in normal Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative subjects, but increased over 1 yr in many areas at a rate greater than in controls. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, postoperative cognitive dysfunction was not associated with 6-week cortical amyloid deposition. The relationship between cognitive dysfunction and regional amyloid burden and the rate of postoperative amyloid deposition merit further investigation.

29394903|t|Impact of amyloid-beta changes on cognitive outcomes in Alzheimer's disease: analysis of clinical trials using a quantitative systems pharmacology model.
29394903|a|BACKGROUND: Despite a tremendous amount of information on the role of amyloid in Alzheimer's disease (AD), almost all clinical trials testing this hypothesis have failed to generate clinically relevant cognitive effects. METHODS: We present an advanced mechanism-based and biophysically realistic quantitative systems pharmacology computer model of an Alzheimer-type neuronal cortical network that has been calibrated with Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale, cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) readouts from historical clinical trials and simulated the differential impact of amyloid-beta (Abeta40 and Abeta42) oligomers on glutamate and nicotinic neurotransmission. RESULTS: Preclinical data suggest a beneficial effect of shorter Abeta forms within a limited dose range. Such a beneficial effect of Abeta40 on glutamate neurotransmission in human patients is absolutely necessary to reproduce clinical data on the ADAS-Cog in minimal cognitive impairment (MCI) patients with and without amyloid load, the effect of APOE genotype effect on the slope of the cognitive trajectory over time in placebo AD patients and higher sensitivity to cholinergic manipulation with scopolamine associated with higher Abeta in MCI subjects. We further derive a relationship between units of Abeta load in our model and the standard uptake value ratio from amyloid imaging. When introducing the documented clinical pharmacodynamic effects on Abeta levels for various amyloid-related clinical interventions in patients with low Abeta baseline, the platform predicts an overall significant worsening for passive vaccination with solanezumab, beta-secretase inhibitor verubecestat and gamma-secretase inhibitor semagacestat. In contrast, all three interventions improved cognition in subjects with moderate to high baseline Abeta levels, with verubecestat anticipated to have the greatest effect (around ADAS-Cog value 1.5 points), solanezumab the lowest (0.8 ADAS-Cog value points) and semagacestat in between. This could explain the success of many amyloid interventions in transgene animals with an artificial high level of Abeta, but not in AD patients with a large variability of amyloid loads. CONCLUSIONS: If these predictions are confirmed in post-hoc analyses of failed clinical amyloid-modulating trials, one should question the rationale behind testing these interventions in early and prodromal subjects with low or zero amyloid load.

29397305|t|Spatial patterns of neuroimaging biomarker change in individuals from families with autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease: a longitudinal study.
29397305|a|BACKGROUND: Models of Alzheimer's disease propose a sequence of amyloid beta (Abeta) accumulation, hypometabolism, and structural decline that precedes the onset of clinical dementia. These pathological features evolve both temporally and spatially in the brain. In this study, we aimed to characterise where in the brain and when in the course of the disease neuroimaging biomarkers become abnormal. METHODS: Between Jan 1, 2009, and Dec 31, 2015, we analysed data from mutation non-carriers, asymptomatic carriers, and symptomatic carriers from families carrying gene mutations in presenilin 1 (PSEN1), presenilin 2 (PSEN2), or amyloid precursor protein (APP) enrolled in the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network. We analysed 11C-Pittsburgh Compound B (11C-PiB) PET, 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET, and structural MRI data using regions of interest to assess change throughout the brain. We estimated rates of biomarker change as a function of estimated years to symptom onset at baseline using linear mixed-effects models and determined the earliest point at which biomarker trajectories differed between mutation carriers and non-carriers. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT00869817) FINDINGS: 11C-PiB PET was available for 346 individuals (162 with longitudinal imaging), 18F-FDG PET was available for 352 individuals (175 with longitudinal imaging), and MRI data were available for 377 individuals (201 with longitudinal imaging). We found a sequence to pathological changes, with rates of Abeta deposition in mutation carriers being significantly different from those in non-carriers first (across regions that showed a significant difference, at a mean of 18 9 years [SD 3 3] before expected onset), followed by hypometabolism (14 1 years [5 1] before expected onset), and lastly structural decline (4 7 years [4 2] before expected onset). This biomarker ordering was preserved in most, but not all, regions. The temporal emergence within a biomarker varied across the brain, with the precuneus being the first cortical region for each method to show divergence between groups (22 2 years before expected onset for Abeta accumulation, 18 8 years before expected onset for hypometabolism, and 13 0 years before expected onset for cortical thinning). INTERPRETATION: Mutation carriers had elevations in Abeta deposition, reduced glucose metabolism, and cortical thinning compared with non-carriers which preceded the expected onset of dementia. Accrual of these pathologies varied throughout the brain, suggesting differential regional and temporal vulnerabilities to Abeta, metabolic decline, and structural atrophy, which should be taken into account when using biomarkers in a clinical setting as well as designing and evaluating clinical trials.

29398668|t|Nardostachys jatamansi Ethanol Extract Ameliorates Abeta42 Cytotoxicity.
29398668|a|The Nardostachys jatamansi DC (NJ) root has been used as a sedative or analgesic to treat neurological symptoms and pain in traditional Korean medicine. Here, we investigate the potential effects of NJ on Alzheimer's disease (AD) and reveal the molecular mechanism through which NJ exerts its effects. The neuroprotective effect of the NJ root ethanol extract against beta amyloid (Abeta) toxicity was examined in vitro using a cell culture system and in vivo using a Drosophila AD model. The NJ extract and chlorogenic acid, a major component of NJ, inhibited Abeta-induced cell death in SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, the NJ extract rescued the neurological phenotypes of the Abeta42-expressing flies (decreased survival and pupariation rate and a locomotor defect) and suppressed Abeta42-induced cell death in the brain. We also found that NJ extract intake reduced glial cell number, reactive oxygen species level, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, and nitric oxide level in Abeta42-expressing flies, without affecting Abeta accumulation. These data suggest that the neuroprotective activity of NJ might be associated with its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, as well as its inhibitory action against ERK signaling; thus, NJ is a promising medicinal plant for the development of AD treatment.

29401604|t|Methionine oxidized apolipoprotein A-I at the crossroads of HDL biogenesis and amyloid formation.
29401604|a|Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) shares with other exchangeable apolipoproteins a high level of structural plasticity. In the lipid-free state, the apolipoprotein amphipathic alpha-helices interact intra- and intermolecularly, providing structural stabilization by self-association. We have reported that lipid-free apoA-I becomes amyloidogenic upon physiologically relevant (myeloperoxidase-mediated) Met oxidation. In this study, we established that Met oxidation promotes amyloidogenesis by reducing the stability of apoA-I monomers and irreversibly disrupting self-association. The oxidized apoA-I monomers also exhibited increased cellular cholesterol release capacity and stronger association with macrophages, compared to nonoxidized apoA-I. Of physiologic relevance, preformed oxidized apoA-I amyloid fibrils induced amyloid formation in nonoxidized apoA-I. This process was enhanced when self-association of nonoxidized apoA-I was disrupted by thermal treatment. Solid state NMR analysis revealed that aggregates formed by seeded nonoxidized apoA-I were structurally similar to those formed by the oxidized protein, featuring a beta-structure-rich amyloid fold alongside alpha-helices retained from the native state. In atherosclerotic lesions, the conditions that promote apoA-I amyloid formation are readily available: myeloperoxidase, active oxygen species, low pH, and high concentration of lipid-free apoA-I. Our results suggest that even partial Met oxidation of apoA-I can nucleate amyloidogenesis, thus sequestering and inactivating otherwise antiatherogenic and HDL-forming apoA-I.-Witkowski, A., Chan, G.

29401635|t|Evidence for a central role of PrP helix 2 in the nucleation of amyloid fibrils.
29401635|a|Amyloid fibrils are filamentous protein aggregates associated with the pathogenesis of a wide variety of human diseases. The formation of such aggregates typically follows nucleation-dependent kinetics, wherein the assembly and structural conversion of amyloidogenic proteins into oligomeric aggregates (nuclei) is the rate-limiting step of the overall reaction. In this study, we sought to gain structural insights into the oligomeric nuclei of the human prion protein (PrP) by preparing a series of deletion mutants lacking 14-44 of the C-terminal 107 residues of PrP and examined the kinetics and thermodynamics of these mutants in amyloid formation. An analysis of the experimental data using the concepts of the Phi-value analysis indicated that the helix 2 region (residues 168-196) acquires an amyloid-like beta-sheet during nucleation, whereas the other regions preserves a relatively disordered structure in the nuclei. This finding suggests that the helix 2 region serves as the nucleation site for the assembly of amyloid fibrils.-Honda, R., Kuwata, K. Evidence for a central role of PrP helix 2 in the nucleation of amyloid fibrils.

29402409|t|Autophagy activated by SIRT6 regulates Abeta induced inflammatory response in RPEs.
29402409|a|Age-associated dysfunction of retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPEs) is considered to be the initial trigger of retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration. Although autophagy is upregulated in RPEs during the course of aging, little is known about how autophagy is regulated and its functional role in RPEs. In this study, we found that expression of Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) and autophagic markers are upregulated in RPEs of aged mice where subretinal deposition of amyloid-beta is accumulated and in amyloid-beta stimulated RPEs. In addition, gain and loss-of-function studies confirmed the positive role of SIRT6 in regulating autophagy. Interesting, inhibition of autophagy attenuates amyloid-beta stimulated inflammatory response in RPEs. Collectively, our findings uncover the autophagy modulated by SIRT6 may be a proinflammatory mechanism for amyloid-beta induced RPE dysfunction.

29404783|t|Neuropathology and biochemistry of early onset familial Alzheimer's disease caused by presenilin-1 missense mutation Thr116Asn.
29404783|a|The majority (~ 55%) of early onset familial Alzheimer disease (FAD) is caused by mutations in the presenilin 1 gene (PSEN1). Here, we describe a family with early onset FAD with a missense mutation in the PSEN1 gene (Thr116Asn). Five family members developed dementia in the third decade of life. One subject underwent autopsy. The onset of clinical symptoms was at the age of 37 years and the disease progressed rapidly. The clinical picture was characterised by progressive memory impairment, amnestic aphasia, and gait disturbances. Neuropathological assessment revealed widespread beta-amyloid (Thal phase 5) and tau (Braak stage 6) pathology. Abundant deposition of diffuse and cored plaques was distributed in cortical and subcortical areas, as well as in the cerebellum, while cotton wool plaques were observed mainly in the occipital cortex. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy was present throughout the brain. In the neocortex, tau pathology, especially neuropil threads, was more abundant in the frontal and occipital cortex and in the hippocampus. Proteomic analyses revealed that the pattern of sarkosyl-insoluble tau was similar to the one seen in sporadic AD. No alpha-synuclein or TDP-43 pathology was found either in cortical nor in subcortical areas. Here, we present the first comprehensive neuropathological and biochemical study of early onset FAD with a missense mutation Thr116Asn in the presenilin 1 gene. In contrast to other PS1-linked AD patients, the present subject developed cotton wool plaques which were not associated with spastic paraparesis.

29404817|t|Dissociation of beta-Sheet Stacking of Amyloid beta Fibrils by Irradiation of Intense, Short-Pulsed Mid-infrared Laser.
29404817|a|Structure of amyloid beta (Abeta) fibrils is rigidly stacked by beta-sheet conformation, and the fibril state of Abeta is profoundly related to pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although mid-infrared light has been used for various biological researches, it has not yet been known whether the infrared light changes the fibril structure of Abeta. In this study, we tested the effect of irradiation of intense mid-infrared light from a free-electron laser (FEL) targeting the amide bond on the reduction of beta-sheet content in Abeta fibrils. The FEL reduced entire contents of proteins exhibiting beta-sheet structure in brain sections from AD model mice, as shown by synchrotron-radiation infrared microscopy analysis. Since Abeta1-42 fibril absorbed a considerable FEL energy at amide I band (6.17 mum), we irradiated the FEL at 6.17 mum and found that beta-sheet content of naked Abeta1-42 fibril was decreased using infrared microscopic analysis. Consistent with the decrease in the beta-sheet content, Congo-red signal is decreased after the irradiation to Abeta1-42 fibril. Furthermore, electron microscopy analysis revealed that morphologies of the fibril and proto-fibril were largely changed after the irradiation. Thus, mid-infrared light dissociates beta-sheet structure of Abeta fibrils, which justifies exploration of possible laser-based therapy for AD.

29406271|t|The Protective Effects of IGF-I against beta-Amyloid-related Downregulation of Hippocampal Somatostatinergic System Involve Activation of Akt and Protein Kinase A.
29406271|a|Somatostatin (SRIF), a neuropeptide highly distributed in the hippocampus and involved in learning and memory, is markedly reduced in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients. The effects of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) against beta amyloid (Abeta)-induced neuronal death and associated cognitive disorders have been extensively reported in experimental models of this disease. Here, we examined the effect of IGF-I on the hippocampal somatostatinergic system in Abeta-treated rats and the molecular mechanisms associated with changes in this peptidergic system. Intracerebroventricular Abeta25-35 administration during 14 days (300 pmol/day) to male rats increased Abeta25-35 levels and cell death and markedly reduced SRIF and SRIF receptor 2 levels in the hippocampus. These deleterious effects were associated with reduced Akt and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation and activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Subcutaneous IGF-I co-administration (50 microg/kg/day) reduced hippocampal Abeta25-35 levels, cell death and JNK activation. In addition, IGF-I prevented the reduction in the components of the somatostatinergic system affected by Abeta infusion. Its co-administration also augmented protein kinase A (PKA) activity, as well as Akt and CREB phosphorylation. These results suggest that IGF-I co-administration may have protective effects on the hippocampal somatostatinergic system against Abeta insult through up-regulation of PKA activity and Akt and CREB phosphorylation.

29407908|t|RTHLVFFARK-NH2: A potent and selective modulator on Cu2+-mediated amyloid-beta protein aggregation and cytotoxicity.
29407908|a|Dysfunctional accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein stimulated by Cu2+ is considered as a key process in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, bifunctional substances capable of chelating Cu2+ and inhibiting Abeta aggregation are promising therapeutic agents against AD. Herein, a novel bifunctional decapeptide RTHLVFFARK-NH2 (RK10) was developed by integrating a metal chelating tripeptide (RTH) and an Abeta aggregation inhibitor Ac-LVFFARK-NH2 (LK7). The high selectivity of RK10 for Cu2+ over other biologically relevant metal ions was demonstrated by isothermal titration calorimetry. RK10 bound Cu2+ with a dissociation constant of 0.02 muM. This enabled RK10 to sequester Cu2+ from Abeta40-Cu2+ species and to arrest the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) catalyzed by Cu2+ or Abeta40-Cu2+ species. Extensive physical, biophysical and biological studies indicate that RK10 targeted free and Cu2+-bound Abeta40 species, suppressed Abeta40 aggregation, and diminished the cytotoxicity induced by Abeta40 and Cu2+-mediated Abeta40 in cultured SH-SY5Y cells. Taken together, the results proved the excellent selective roles of RK10 in inhibiting Cu2+-mediated Abeta40 aggregation and eliminating ROS generation catalyzed by Cu2+/Abeta40-Cu2+ species. Thus, this work provided new insight into the design and development of potent bifunctional inhibitors against Abeta aggregation and cytotoxicity.

29408451|t|Fluorescence imaging of the interaction of amyloid beta 40 peptides with live cells and model membrane.
29408451|a|Amyloid beta peptides (Abeta) found in plaques in the brain have been widely recognised as a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease although the underlying mechanism is still unknown. Abeta40 and Abeta40(A2T) peptides were synthesized and their effects on neuronal cells are reported together with the effect of tetramer forms of the peptides. ThT assay revealed that mutation affected the lag time and aggregation and the presence of lipid vesicles changed the fibril formation profile for both peptides. The A2T mutation appeared to reduce cytotoxicity and lessen binding of Abeta40 peptides to neuronal cells. Fluorescence microscopy of the interaction between Abeta40 peptides and giant unilamellar vesicles revealed that both peptides led to formation of smaller vesicles although the tetramer of Abeta(A2T) appeared to promote vesicle aggregation.

29409009|t|A method for inferring regional origins of neurodegeneration.
29409009|a|Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, is characterized by the emergence and spread of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, causing widespread neurodegeneration. Though the progression of Alzheimer's disease is considered to be stereotyped, the significant variability within clinical populations obscures this interpretation on the individual level. Of particular clinical importance is understanding where exactly pathology, e.g. tau, emerges in each patient and how the incipient atrophy pattern relates to future spread of disease. Here we demonstrate a newly developed graph theoretical method of inferring prior disease states in patients with Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment using an established network diffusion model and an L1-penalized optimization algorithm. Although the 'seeds' of origin using our inference method successfully reproduce known trends in Alzheimer's disease staging on a population level, we observed that the high degree of heterogeneity between patients at baseline is also reflected in their seeds. Additionally, the individualized seeds are significantly more predictive of future atrophy than a single seed placed at the hippocampus. Our findings illustrate that understanding where disease originates in individuals is critical to determining how it progresses and that our method allows us to infer early stages of disease from atrophy patterns observed at diagnosis.

29410161|t|Trace amounts of pyroglutaminated Abeta-(3-42) enhance aggregation of Abeta-(1-42) on neuronal membranes at physiological concentrations: FCS analysis of cell surface.
29410161|a|Minor species of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta), such as Abeta-(1-43) and pyroglutaminated Abeta-(3-42) (Abeta-(3pE-42)), have been suggested to be involved in the initiation of the Abeta aggregation process, which is closely associated with the etiology of Alzheimer's disease. They can play important roles in aggregation not only in the aqueous phase but also on neuroral membranes; however, the latter behaviors remain mostly unexplored. Here, initial aggregation processes of Abeta on living cells were monitored at physiological nanomolar concentrations by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. Membrane-bound Abeta-(1-42) and Abeta-(1-40) formed oligomers composed of ~4 Abeta molecules during 48-h incubation, whereas the peptides remained monomeric in the culture medium, indicating that the membranes facilitated Abeta aggregation. The presence of 5 mol% Abeta-(3pE-42), but not Abeta-(1-43), significantly enhanced the aggregation of Abeta-(1-42) up to ~10-mers. On the other hand, neither trace amounts of Abeta-(1-42) nor Abeta-(3pE-42) enhanced the aggregation of Abeta-(1-40). The observed small Abeta oligomers are expected to act as pathogenic seeds for amyloid fibrils responsible for neurotoxicity.

29410317|t|Secreted amyloid precursor protein alpha activates neuronal insulin receptors and prevents diabetes-induced encephalopathy.
29410317|a|Secreted amyloid precursor protein alpha (sAPPalpha) is a potent neurotrophin in the CNS but a dedicated receptor has not been found. However, protein interactions involving amyloid beta (Abeta), a peptide cleaved from the same parent peptide as sAPPalpha, indicate that insulin receptors (IRs) could be a target of amyloid peptides. In this study, in vitro analysis of cortical neuronal cultures revealed that exogenous sAPPalpha increased IR phosphorylation in the absence of insulin. Furthermore, in an APP overexpressing mouse model, sAPPalpha bound IRs in the cortex with significantly greater binding in hypoinsulinemic animals. To further examine the effects of sAPPalpha on the diabetic brain, we next rendered sAPPalpha overexpressing mice insulin depleted and found that sAPPalpha blocked aberrant tau phosphorylation (T231) in cortical tissue after 16 weeks diabetes. sAPPalpha overexpression also prevented hyperphosphorylation of AKT/GSK3 and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). In total, these data show sAPPalpha binds and activates neuronal IRs and that sAPPalpha has a protective effect on diabetic brain tissue.

29411122|t|Dihydroceramide Desaturase 1 Inhibitors Reduce Amyloid-beta Levels in Primary Neurons from an Alzheimer's Disease Transgenic Model.
29411122|a|PURPOSE: The induction of autophagy has recently been explored as a promising therapeutic strategy to combat Alzheimer's disease. Among many other factors, there is evidence that ceramides/dihydroceramides act as mediators of autophagy, although the exact mechanisms underlying such effects are poorly understood. Here, we describe how two dihydroceramide desaturase inhibitors (XM461 and XM462) trigger autophagy and reduce amyloid secretion by neurons. METHODS: Neurons isolated from wild-type and APP/PS1 transgenic mice were exposed to the two dihydroceramide desaturase inhibitors to assess their effect on these cell's protein and lipid profiles. RESULTS: Both dihydroceramide desaturase inhibitors increased the autophagic vesicles in wild-type neurons, reflected as an increase in LC3-II, and this was correlated with the accumulation of dihydroceramides and dihydrosphingomyelins. Exposing APP/PS1 transgenic neurons to these inhibitors also produced a 50% reduction in amyloid secretion and/or production. The lipidomic defects triggered by these dihydroceramide desaturase inhibitors were correlated with a loss of S6K activity, witnessed by the changes in S6 phosphorylation, which strongly suggested a reduction of mTORC1 activity. CONCLUSIONS: The data obtained strongly suggest that dihydroceramide desaturase 1 activity may modulate autophagy and mTORC1 activity in neurons, inhibiting amyloid secretion and S6K activity. As such, it is tantalizing to propose that dihydroceramide desaturase 1 may be an important therapeutic target to combat amyloidosis.

29411261|t|Amentoflavone Ameliorates Abeta1-42-Induced Memory Deficits and Oxidative Stress in Cellular and Rat Model.
29411261|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system, is the most common cause of senile dementia. This study aimed to investigate whether amentoflavone (AF), a biflavonoid compound, could exert neuroprotective activities against AD. The AD model was established by the intracranial injection of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in rat models. The effect of AF on cognitive function was examined using the Morris water maze test. Cell survival and apoptosis in the hippocampal region in an animal model were detected using Nissl staining and a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferased UTP nick-end labeling assay, respectively. The levels of oxidant enzymes were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Signaling molecule expressions were examined by western blotting. Our results showed that AF significantly attenuated Abeta-induced deficits in neurological functions as well as neuronal cell death and apoptosis in the hippocampal region. Moreover, our findings revealed that AF increased nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression and translocation and activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling. In a cellular model of AD established by exposing PC12 cells to Abeta, our results provided further evidence that the neuroprotective activities of AF were mediated by modulating Nrf2 through AMPK/glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta signaling. AF exerts a protective effect against Abeta1-42-induced neurotoxcicity by inducing Nrf2 antioxidant pathways via AMPK signaling activation, which provided experimental evidence that AF might provide a clinical benefit to patients with AD.

29414379|t|Prion-like seeding and nucleation of intracellular amyloid-beta.
29414379|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain tissue can act as a seed to accelerate aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) into plaques in AD transgenic mice. Abeta seeds have been hypothesized to accelerate plaque formation in a prion-like manner of templated seeding and intercellular propagation. However, the structure(s) and location(s) of the Abeta seeds remain unknown. Moreover, in contrast to tau and alpha-synuclein, an in vitro system with prion-like Abeta has not been reported. Here we treat human APP expressing N2a cells with AD transgenic mouse brain extracts to induce inclusions of Abeta in a subset of cells. We isolate cells with induced Abeta inclusions and using immunocytochemistry, western blot and infrared spectroscopy show that these cells produce oligomeric Abeta over multiple replicative generations. Further, we demonstrate that cell lysates of clones with induced oligomeric Abeta can induce aggregation in previously untreated N2a APP cells. These data strengthen the case that Abeta acts as a prion-like protein, demonstrate that Abeta seeds can be intracellular oligomers and for the first time provide a cellular model of nucleated seeding of Abeta.

29415231|t|Detection of Alzheimer Disease (AD)-Specific Tau Pathology in AD and NonAD Tauopathies by Immunohistochemistry With Novel Conformation-Selective Tau Antibodies.
29415231|a|Aggregation of tau into fibrillar structures within the CNS is a pathological hallmark of a clinically heterogeneous set of neurodegenerative diseases termed tauopathies. Unique misfolded conformations of tau, referred to as strains, are hypothesized to underlie the distinct neuroanatomical and cellular distribution of pathological tau aggregates. Here, we report the identification of novel tau monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that selectively bind to an Alzheimer disease (AD)-specific conformation of pathological tau. Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue from various AD and nonAD tauopathies demonstrate selective binding of mAbs GT-7 and GT-38 to AD tau pathologies and absence of immunoreactivity for tau aggregates that are diagnostic of corticobasal degenerations (CBD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and Pick's disease (PiD). In cases with co-occurring AD tauopathy, GT-7 and GT-38 distinguish comorbid AD tau from pathological tau in frontotemporal lobar degeneration characterized by tau inclusions (FTLD-Tau), as confirmed by the presence of both 3 versus 4 microtubule-binding repeat isoforms (3R and 4R tau isoforms, respectively), in AD neurofibrillary tangles but not in the tau aggregates of CBD, PSP, or PiD. These findings support the concept of an AD-specific tau strain. The mAbs described here enable the selective detection of AD tau pathology in nonAD tauopathies.

29417448|t|Atorvastatin Attenuates Cognitive Deficits and Neuroinflammation Induced by Abeta1-42 Involving Modulation of TLR4/TRAF6/NF-kappaB Pathway.
29417448|a|Inflammatory damage aggravates the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the mechanism of inflammatory damage may provide a new therapeutic window for the treatment of AD. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated signaling can regulate the inflammatory process. However, changes in TLR4 signaling pathway induced by beta-amyloid (Abeta) have not been well characterized in brain, especially in the hippocampus. In the present study, we explored the changes of TLR4 signaling pathway induced by Abeta in the hippocampus and the role of atorvastatin in modulating this signal pathway and neurotoxicity induced by Abeta. Experimental AD rats were induced by intrahippocampal injection of Abeta1-42, and the rats were treated with atorvastatin by oral gavage from 3 weeks before to 6 days after injections of Abeta1-42. To determine the spatial learning and memory ability of rats in the AD models, Morris water maze (MWM) was performed. The expression of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), ionized calcium binding adapter molecule-1 (Iba-1), TLR4, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), and nuclear transcription factor (NF)-kappaB (NF-kappaB) protein in the hippocampus was detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Compared to the control group, increased expression of TLR4, TRAF6, and NF-kappaB was observed in the hippocampus at 7 days post-injection of Abeta (P < 0.01). Furthermore, atorvastatin treatment significantly ameliorated cognitive deficits of rats, attenuated microglia and astrocyte activation, inhibited apoptosis, and down-regulated the expression of TLR4, TRAF6, and NF-kappaB, both at the mRNA and protein levels (P < 0.01). TLR4 signaling pathway is thus actively involved in Abeta-induced neuroinflammation and atorvastatin treatment can exert the therapeutic benefits for AD via the TLR4 signaling pathway.

29427280|t|Geniposide Increases Unfolded Protein Response-Mediating HRD1 Expression to Accelerate APP Degradation in Primary Cortical Neurons.
29427280|a|Altered proteostasis induced by amyloid peptide aggregation and hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, is a prominent feature of Alzheimer's disease, which highlights the occurrence of endoplasmic reticulum stress and triggers the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a signaling pathway that enforces adaptive programs to sustain proteostasis. In this study, we investigated the role of geniposide in the activation of UPR induced by high glucose in primary cortical neurons. We found that high glucose induced a significant activation of UPR, and geniposide enhanced the effect of high glucose on the phosphorylation of IRE1alpha, the most conserved UPR signaling branch. We observed that geniposide induced the expression of HRD1, an ubiquitin-ligase E3 in a time dependent manner, and amplified the expression of HRD1 induced by high glucose in primary cortical neurons. Suppression of IRE1alpha activity with STF-083010, an inhibitor of IRE1 phosphorylation, prevented the roles of geniposide on the expression of HRD1 and APP degradation in high glucose-treated cortical neurons. In addition, the results from RNA interfere on HRD1 revealed that HRD1 was involved in geniposide regulating APP degradation in cortical neurons. These data suggest that geniposide might be benefit to re-establish proteostasis by enhancing the UPR to decrease the load of APP in neurons challenged by high glucose.

29427755|t|High fat diet treatment impairs hippocampal long-term potentiation without alterations of the core neuropathological features of Alzheimer disease.
29427755|a|Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and obesity might increase the risk for AD by 2-fold. Different attempts to model the effect of diet-induced diabetes on AD pathology in transgenic animal models, resulted in opposite conclusions. Here, we used a novel knock-in mouse model for AD, which, differently from other models, does not overexpress any proteins. Long-term high fat diet treatment triggers a reduction in hippocampal N-acetyl-aspartate/myo-inositol metabolites ratio and impairs long term potentiation in hippocampal acute slices. Interestingly, these alterations do not correlate with changes in the core neuropathological features of AD, i.e. amyloidosis and Tau hyperphosphorylation. The data suggest that AD phenotypes associated with high fat diet treatment seen in other models for AD might be exacerbated because of the overexpressing systems used to study the effects of familial AD mutations. Our work supports the increasing insight that knock-in mice might be more relevant models to study the link between metabolic disorders and AD.

29428714|t|beta-amyloid deposition is associated with gait variability in usual aging.
29428714|a|BACKGROUND: Higher amyloid burden predicts gait slowing in aging. Whether and which gait characteristics are associated with amyloid burden is less clear. Gait variability may be more sensitive to amyloid burden than mean gait characteristics. METHODS: In the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, 99 older participants without neurological disease had concurrent amyloid imaging and assessment of gait characteristics. beta-amyloid burden was measured using 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography. PiB+/- status was based on a mean cortical distribution volume ratio (DVR) cut point. Gait characteristics were quantified by 3D motion analysis. Cross-sectional associations of PiB+/- status and DVR in motor-related regions (primary motor cortex, putamen, caudate) with gait characteristics were examined using linear regression, adjusted for age, sex, height, body mass index, gait speed and covariates (memory, executive function, visuoperceptual speed, depressive symptoms, cardiovascular risk, ApoE epsilon4, cerebrovascular burden, neurodegeneration, peripheral arterial disease, knee pain). RESULTS: Being PiB+ and higher DVR in motor-related regions were associated with greater gait speed variability, cadence variability, and gait cycle time variability but not with mean gait characteristics. Associations remained similar after adjustment for gait speed and covariates, except for memory, which attenuated associations of PiB+/- with cadence variability and gait cycle time variability. Associations were prominent in men but were not found in women. CONCLUSIONS: In usual aging, integrated temporal gait variability measures, but not mean performance, appear related to amyloid burden from cortical and motor-related cortical and subcortical regions, especially in men. Increased gait variability may be a subclinical indicator of increased amyloid burden in men.

29429971|t|Biomarker pattern of ARIA-E participants in phase 3 randomized clinical trials with bapineuzumab.
29429971|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema/effusion (ARIA-E) observed in bapineuzumab clinical trials was associated with specific biomarker patterns. METHODS: Bapineuzumab, an anti-beta-amyloid monoclonal antibody, was evaluated in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease. Amyloid PET imaging, CSF biomarkers, or volumetric MRI (vMRI) were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 1,512 participants underwent one or more biomarker assessments; 154 developed incident ARIA-E. No differences were observed at baseline between ARIA-E and non-ARIA-E participants in brain amyloid burden by PET, the majority of vMRI measures, or CSF biomarkers, with the exception of lower baseline CSF Abeta42 in APOE epsilon4 noncarrier ARIA-E vs non-ARIA-E groups (bapineuzumab non-ARIA-E p = 0.027; placebo non-ARIA-E p = 0.012). At week 71, bapineuzumab-treated participants with ARIA-E vs non-ARIA-E showed greater reduction in brain amyloid PET, greater reductions in CSF phosphorylated tau (p-tau) (all comparisons p < 0.01), and total tau (t-tau) (all comparisons p < 0.025), and greater hippocampal volume reduction and ventricular enlargement (all p < 0.05). Greater reduction in CSF Abeta40 concentrations was observed for ARIA-E versus both non-ARIA-E groups (bapineuzumab/placebo non-ARIA-E p = 0.015/0.049). No group differences were observed at week 71 for changes in whole brain volume or CSF Abeta42. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline biomarkers largely do not predict risk for developing ARIA-E. ARIA-E was associated with significant longitudinal changes in several biomarkers, with larger reductions in amyloid PET and CSF p-tau and t-tau concentrations, and paradoxically greater hippocampal volume reduction and ventricular enlargement, suggesting that ARIA-E in bapineuzumab-treated cases may be related to increased Abeta efflux from the brain and affecting downstream pathogenic processes.

29429973|a|

29432188|t|Identification of genetic risk factors in the Chinese population implicates a role of immune system in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.
29432188|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of mortality among the elderly. We performed a whole-genome sequencing study of AD in the Chinese population. In addition to the variants identified in or around the APOE locus (sentinel variant rs73052335, P = 1.44 x 10-14), two common variants, GCH1 (rs72713460, P = 4.36 x 10-5) and KCNJ15 (rs928771, P = 3.60 x 10-6), were identified and further verified for their possible risk effects for AD in three small non-Asian AD cohorts. Genotype-phenotype analysis showed that KCNJ15 variant rs928771 affects the onset age of AD, with earlier disease onset in minor allele carriers. In addition, altered expression level of the KCNJ15 transcript can be observed in the blood of AD subjects. Moreover, the risk variants of GCH1 and KCNJ15 are associated with changes in their transcript levels in specific tissues, as well as changes of plasma biomarkers levels in AD subjects. Importantly, network analysis of hippocampus and blood transcriptome datasets suggests that the risk variants in the APOE, GCH1, and KCNJ15 loci might exert their functions through their regulatory effects on immune-related pathways. Taking these data together, we identified common variants of GCH1 and KCNJ15 in the Chinese population that contribute to AD risk. These variants may exert their functional effects through the immune system.

29432723|t|Phos-tau peptide immunization of amyloid-tg-mice reduced non-mutant phos-tau pathology, improved cognition and reduced amyloid plaques.
29432723|a|Tau-immumotherapy has shown promising results in tangle/tauopathy-tg animal models. Here we immunized amyloid-mice (APPSwe/PSEN1dE9-tg, presenting amyloid-plaques, not neurofibrillary-tangles) with phos-tau peptides, previously shown by us to have high efficacy in mutant-tau tauopathy-mice. These amyloid-mice allowed us to test the effect of the vaccine in a model of familial AD patients with mutant amyloid plaque pathology, where tau pathology - once develops - is of non-mutant tau. Fourteen-month-old amyloid-mice were immunized with phos-tau peptides or vehicle. Eight weeks later, amelioration of cognitive impairment was noticed. Histological analysis revealed that the phos (non-mutant)-tau pathology (detected by us in these aged amyloid-mice while not in non-tg-mice), was lower in the phos-tau immunized amyloid-mice than in the non-immunized mice. Interestingly, we detected a decrease in amyloid plaque pathology, probably associated with the increased microglial burden, which surrounded both tau and amyloid pathology. These results point to the added value of immunizing AD-mice with the phos-tau-vaccine, targeting both tau and amyloid pathology, which may have clinical relevance. It also points to the multifaceted interplay between tau/amyloid pathologies.

29433392|t|The Protective Effects of Gardenia jasminoides (Fructus Gardenia) on Amyloid-beta-Induced Mouse Cognitive Impairment and Neurotoxicity.
29433392|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease in the world. Although the exact causes of AD have not yet been fully elucidated, cholinergic dysfunction, mitochondrial damage, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation have been recognized as influential factors. Current drugs that are designed to address only a single target are unable to mitigate or prevent the progression of this complicated disease, so new disease-modifying drugs are urgently needed. Chinese herbs with thousand years of effective usage might be a good source for potential drugs. Gardenia jasminoides J. Ellis (Fructus Gardenia) is a common traditional Chinese medicine with tranquilizing effects, which is an important component of widely-used traditional Chinese medicine for dementia. GJ-4 is crocin richments extracted from Gardenia jasminoides J. Ellis. In our study, we attempted to observe the effects of GJ-4 on learning and memory injury induced by amyloid-[Formula: see text] 25-35 (A[Formula: see text] injection in mice. Treatment with GJ-4 dose-dependently enhanced the memory and cognition ability of A[Formula: see text]-injected mice. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed the protective effect of GJ-4 was related to its protection of neurons and cholinergic dysfunction. The mechanistic results also indicated that GJ-4 could enhance antioxidant capacity and attenuate neuroinflammation. Our results implied that GJ-4 might be a promising drug to improve cognitive and memory impairment, with multiple targets.

29435558|t|Association Between Amyloid and Tau Accumulation in Young Adults With Autosomal Dominant Alzheimer Disease.
29435558|a|Importance: It is critically important to improve our ability to diagnose and track Alzheimer disease (AD) as early as possible. Individuals with autosomal dominant forms of AD can provide clues as to which and when biological changes are reliably present prior to the onset of clinical symptoms. Objective: To characterize the associations between amyloid and tau deposits in the brains of cognitively unimpaired and impaired carriers of presenilin 1 (PSEN1) E280A mutation. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional imaging study, we leveraged data from a homogeneous autosomal dominant AD kindred, which allowed us to examine measurable tau deposition as a function of individuals' proximity to the expected onset of dementia. Cross-sectional measures of carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B positron emission tomography (PET) and flortaucipir F 18 (previously known as AV 1451, T807) PET imaging were assessed in 24 PSEN1 E280A kindred members (age range, 28-55 years), including 12 carriers, 9 of whom were cognitively unimpaired and 3 of whom had mild cognitive impairment, and 12 cognitively unimpaired noncarriers. Main Outcomes and Measures: We compared carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B PET cerebral with cerebellar distribution volume ratios as well as flortaucipir F 18 PET cerebral with cerebellar standardized uptake value ratios in mutation carriers and noncarriers. Spearman correlations characterized the associations between age and mean cortical Pittsburgh Compound B distribution volume ratio levels or regional flortaucipir standardized uptake value ratio levels in both groups. Results: Of the 24 individuals, the mean (SD) age was 38.0 (7.4) years, or approximately 6 years younger than the expected onset of clinical symptoms in carriers. Compared with noncarriers, cognitively unimpaired mutation carriers had elevated mean cortical Pittsburgh Compound B distribution volume ratio levels in their late 20s, and 7 of 9 carriers older than 30 years reached the threshold for amyloidosis (distribution volume ratio level > 1.2). Elevated levels of tau deposition were seen within medial temporal lobe regions in amyloid-positive mutation carriers 6 years before clinical onset of AD in this kindred. Substantial tau deposition in the neocortex was only observed in 1 unimpaired carrier and in those with mild cognitive impairment. beta-Amyloid uptake levels were diffusely elevated in unimpaired carriers approximately 15 years prior to expected onset of mild cognitive impairment. In carriers, higher levels of tau deposition were associated with worse performance on the Mini-Mental State Examination (entorhinal cortex: r = -0.60; P = .04; inferior temporal lobe: r = -0.54; P = .06) and the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer Disease Word List Delayed Recall (entorhinal cortex: r = -0.86; P < .001; inferior temporal lobe: r = -0.70; P = .01). Conclusions and Relevance: The present findings add to the growing evidence that molecular markers can characterize biological changes associated with AD in individuals who are still cognitively unimpaired. The findings also suggest that tau PET imaging may be useful as a biomarker to distinguish individuals at high risk to develop the clinical symptoms of AD and to track disease progression.

29438037|t|Tau-negative amnestic dementia masquerading as Alzheimer disease dementia.
29438037|a|OBJECTIVE: To describe the phenomenon of tau-negative amnestic dementia mimicking Alzheimer disease (AD) clinically and radiologically and to highlight the importance of biomarkers in AD research. METHODS: Eight participants with amnestic mild cognitive impairment or AD dementia were evaluated by a behavioral neurologist and had a standardized neuropsychological battery performed. All participants completed structural (MRI) and molecular (amyloid and tau PET) imaging. AD-signature thickness and adjusted hippocampal volume served as structural biomarkers, while standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) from validated regions of interest for amyloid and tau PET were used to determine molecular biomarker status. RESULTS: All participants were thought to have AD as the primary driver of their symptoms before any PET imaging. All participants had hippocampal atrophy, and 2 participants fell below the AD-signature thickness cutoff for elderly controls (2.57), with a further 3 falling below the more stringent cutoff based on young controls (2.67). Four participants were amyloid positive (SUVR >1.42), and all were tau negative (SUVR <1.33). CONCLUSIONS: The participants presented here were clinically impaired, with structural imaging evidence of neurodegeneration, in the absence of any significant tau accumulation. Therefore, AD is unlikely as a cause of their clinical presentation and neurodegenerative imaging findings. Several implications are discussed, including the need to establish amyloid and tau positivity in N+ participants before enrolling them in trials of disease-modifying therapy agents for AD.

29438978|t|A single N-terminal phosphomimic disrupts TDP-43 polymerization, phase separation, and RNA splicing.
29438978|a|TDP-43 is an RNA-binding protein active in splicing that concentrates into membraneless ribonucleoprotein granules and forms aggregates in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer's disease. Although best known for its predominantly disordered C-terminal domain which mediates ALS inclusions, TDP-43 has a globular N-terminal domain (NTD). Here, we show that TDP-43 NTD assembles into head-to-tail linear chains and that phosphomimetic substitution at S48 disrupts TDP-43 polymeric assembly, discourages liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in vitro, fluidizes liquid-liquid phase separated nuclear TDP-43 reporter constructs in cells, and disrupts RNA splicing activity. Finally, we present the solution NMR structure of a head-to-tail NTD dimer comprised of two engineered variants that allow saturation of the native polymerization interface while disrupting higher-order polymerization. These data provide structural detail for the established mechanistic role of the well-folded TDP-43 NTD in splicing and link this function to LLPS. In addition, the fusion-tag solubilized, recombinant form of TDP-43 full-length protein developed here will enable future phase separation and in vitro biochemical assays on TDP-43 function and interactions that have been hampered in the past by TDP-43 aggregation.

29439322|t|Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers are Differentially Related to Structural and Functional Changes in Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type.
29439322|a|The two cardinal pathologies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) develop according to distinct anatomical trajectories. Cerebral tau-related pathology first accumulates in the mesial temporal region, while amyloid-related pathology first appears in neocortex. The eventual distributions of these pathologies reflect their anatomical origins. An implication is that the cardinal pathologies might exert preferential effects on the structurofunctional brain changes observed in AD. We investigated this hypothesis in 39 patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type. Interrelationships were analyzed between cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of the cardinal pathologies, volumetric brain changes using magnetic resonance imaging, and brain metabolism using [18F]-FDG-PET. Amyloid-related pathology was preferentially associated with structurofunctional changes in the precuneus and lateral temporal regions. Tau-related pathology was not associated with changes in these regions. These findings support the hypothesis that tau- and amyloid-pathology exert differential effects on structurofunctional changes in the AD brain. These findings have implications for future therapeutic trials and hint at a more complex relationship between the cardinal pathologies and disruption of brain networks.

29439323|t|Interrelationship between the Levels of C9orf72 and Amyloid-beta Protein Precursor and Amyloid-beta in Human Cells and Brain Samples.
29439323|a|A subset of C9orf72 repeat expansion-carrying frontotemporal dementia patients display an Alzheimer-like decrease in cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta (Abeta) biomarker levels. We report that downregulation of C9orf72 in non-neuronal human cells overexpressing amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) resulted in increased levels of secreted AbetaPP fragments and Abeta, while levels of AbetaPP or its C-terminal fragments (CTFs) remained unchanged. In neuronal cells, AbetaPP and C83 CTF levels were decreased upon C9orf72 knockdown, but those of secreted AbetaPP fragments or Abeta remained unchanged. C9orf72 protein levels significantly increased in human brain with advancing neurofibrillary pathology and positively correlated with brain Abeta42 levels. Our data suggest that altered C9orf72 levels may lead to cell-type specific alterations in AbetaPP processing, but warrant further studies to clarify the underlying mechanisms.

29439324|t|Altered Expression of Urea Cycle Enzymes in Amyloid-beta Protein Precursor Overexpressing PC12 Cells and in Sporadic Alzheimer's Disease Brain.
29439324|a|Urea cycle enzymes may play important yet poorly characterized roles in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our previous results showed that amyloid-beta (Abeta) affects urea cycle enzymes in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. The aim of the present study was to investigate the changes in arginases, other urea cycle enzymes, and nitric oxide synthases (NOSs) in PC12 cells transfected with AbetaPP bearing the double 'Swedish' mutation (APPsw, K670M/N671L) and in postmortem sporadic AD brain hippocampus; the mutation intensifies Abeta production and strongly associates with AD neuropathology. mRNA expression was analyzed using real-time PCR in cell cultures and DNA microarrays in hippocampal CA1 area of human AD brains. Arginase activity was measured spectrophotometrically, and arginine, ornithine, and citrulline levels by high-performance liquid chromatography. Our data demonstrated that the expression and activity of arginases (Arg1 and Arg2), as well as the expression of argininosuccinate synthase (Ass) were significantly reduced in APPsw cells compared to control. However, argininosuccinate lyase (Asl) was upregulated in APPsw cells. Real-time PCR analysis revealed significant elevation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (Nnos) mRNA in APPsw cells, without changes in the endothelial Enos, whereas inducible Inos was undetectable. The changes were found to follow closely those observed in the human hippocampal CA1 region of sporadic AD brains. The changes in enzyme expression were accompanied in APPsw cells by significantly elevated citrulline, ornithine, and arginine. Our findings demonstrate that AbetaPP/Abeta alters arginine metabolism and induces a shift of cellular homeostasis that may support the oxidative/nitrosative stress observed in AD.

29439327|t|Stabilized Low-n Amyloid-beta Oligomers Induce Robust Novel Object Recognition Deficits Associated with Inflammatory, Synaptic, and GABAergic Dysfunction in the Rat.
29439327|a|BACKGROUND: With current treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) only providing temporary symptomatic benefits, disease modifying drugs are urgently required. This approach relies on improved understanding of the early pathophysiology of AD. A new hypothesis has emerged, in which early memory loss is considered a synapse failure caused by soluble amyloid-beta oligomers (Abetao). These small soluble Abetao, which precede the formation of larger fibrillar assemblies, may be the main cause of early AD pathologies. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of acute administration of stabilized low-n amyloid-beta1-42 oligomers (Abetao1-42) on cognitive, inflammatory, synaptic, and neuronal markers in the rat. METHODS: Female and male Lister Hooded rats received acute intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of either vehicle or 5 nmol of Abetao1-42 (10muL). Cognition was assessed in the novel object recognition (NOR) paradigm at different time points. Levels of inflammatory (IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha), synaptic (PSD-95, SNAP-25), and neuronal (n-acetylaspartate, parvalbumin-positive cells) markers were investigated in different brain regions (prefrontal and frontal cortex, striatum, dorsal and ventral hippocampus). RESULTS: Acute ICV administration of Abetao1-42 induced robust and enduring NOR deficits. These deficits were reversed by acute administration of donepezil and rolipram but not risperidone. Postmortem analysis revealed an increase in inflammatory markers, a decrease in synaptic markers and parvalbumin containing interneurons in the frontal cortex, with no evidence of widespread neuronal loss. CONCLUSION: Taken together the results suggest that acute administration of soluble low-n Abetao may be a useful model to study the early mechanisms involved in AD and provide us with a platform for testing novel therapeutic approaches that target the early underlying synaptic pathology.

29439341|t|Reproducibility of Alzheimer's Disease Cerebrospinal Fluid-Biomarker Measurements under Clinical Routine Conditions.
29439341|a|Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is one of the key tools for the state-of-the-art differential diagnosis of dementias. Dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by elevated CSF levels of total Tau (tTau) and phospho-181-Tau (pTau) and low CSF amyloid-beta42 (Abeta42). Discrepancies in the laboratory analysis of human materials are well known and much effort has been put into harmonization procedures. In this study, we measured CSF biomarkers of more than 100 patients obtained under clinical routine conditions in two different clinical laboratories. The CSF biomarker levels obtained from the two different sites were significantly correlated: R2 = 0.7129 (tTau, p < 0.001), 0.7914 (pTau, p < 0.001), 0.5078 (Abeta42, p < 0.001), 0.5739 (Abeta40, p < 0.001), and 0.4308 (Abeta42/40, p < 0.001). However, the diagnostic classifications of the Abeta42, tTau, and pTau levels of identical subjects into normal versus pathological range made by the two different sites showed substantial discrepancies (31.5%, 29.6%, and 25.0% discordant cases, respectively). Applying Abeta42/40, instead of CSF Abeta42 alone, lead to a reduction of the discordant cases to 16.8%. Our findings suggest that CSF Abeta42/40 can outperform Abeta42 as a biomarker for AD neuropathology, not only under well-controlled study conditions but also in real life clinical routine. Thus, we recommend the inclusion of Abeta42/40 as a CSF biomarker in the diagnostic procedure.

29439351|t|Relationship of Area of Soft Drusen in Retina with Cerebral Amyloid-beta Accumulation and Blood Amyloid-beta Level in the Elderly.
29439351|a|BACKGROUND: Histopathological studies have confirmed that soft drusen contains amyloid-beta (Abeta). OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between the area of soft drusen in the macular area and cerebral Abeta accumulation or plasma Abeta level in elderly persons without dementia. METHODS: Fourteen consecutive patients (18 eyes) aged >=50 years with macular soft drusen were studied prospectively. From color fundus photographs, the area of soft drusen (pixel) within a 6,000 mum diameter with the macula as center was measured. Standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) was obtained from positron emission tomography using florbetapir, which indicates the ratio of cerebral cortical-to-cerebellar Abeta accumulation. Ratio of plasma Abeta1-42 to Abeta1-40 level was calculated. RESULTS: Mean age was 73.3+-7.6 years. The soft drusen area was 4.32+-2.42 mm2. The SUVR was 1.08+-0.15. Plasma Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 ratio was 0.17+-0.08. When SUVR >=1.10 was defined as positive and <1.10 as negative, the soft drusen area in SUVR-positive patients (6.19+-1.14 mm2) was significantly (p = 0.0043) larger than that in SUVR-negative patients (3.13+-2.27 mm2). Multivariate regression analysis showed that SUVR positivity correlated with soft drusen area (p = 0.0484) and with Voxel-based Specific Regional Analysis System for Alzheimer's Disease score (p = 0.0360). However, there was no correlation with gender (p = 0.1921), age (p = 0.2361), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale score (p = 0.6310), Mini-Mental State Examination score (p = 0.4246), or plasma Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 ratio (p = 0.8398). CONCLUSION: Among elderly persons without dementia, the area of soft drusen was larger in those with more extensive cerebral Abeta accumulation. The area of soft drusen may be a biomarker of cerebral Abeta accumulation.

29439352|t|Linking Atrial Fibrillation with Alzheimer's Disease: Epidemiological, Pathological, and Mechanistic Evidence.
29439352|a|Many studies have shown a relationship between atrial fibrillation (AF) and vascular dementia. AF is a major risk factor for stroke, and stroke is the greatest risk factor for vascular dementia. However, the relationship between Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, and AF remains unclear. At least four epidemiological studies have reported AF significantly raises the risk of AD 1.5- to 2.5-fold. Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, resulting from persistent AF, could explain the link as hypoperfusion may mechanistically exacerbate amyloid-beta (Abeta) neuropathology, such as senile plaques and amyloid angiopathy, by upregulating Abeta-producing enzymes and lowering Abeta clearance efficiency. In addition, hypoperfusion may exacerbate tau pathology directly through upregulation of tau-phosphorylating enzymes and indirectly via the amyloid cascade. However, most neuropathological studies do not support the direct link between AD pathology and AF but rather suggests vascular neuropathology is related to, or coexistent with, AF and lowers the threshold for clinically-evident AD. Vascular neuropathology may thus mediate the link between AD and AF. From a treatment perspective, an observational study has shown that catheter ablation is associated with less incidence of AD in AF patients, suggesting rhythm-control suppresses hypoperfusion-induced AD neuropathology. In addition, rate-control may lower the rate of cognitive decline in cognitively impaired elderly subjects with AF. Further studies are warranted to clarify the mechanisms underlying the linkage between AF and AD. However, anticoagulation and rhythm-/rate-control against AF may hold promise even for AD patients.

29440563|t|In vivo 18F-AV-1451 tau PET signal in MAPT mutation carriers varies by expected tau isoforms.
29440563|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate 18F-AV-1451 tau PET binding among microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) mutation carriers. METHODS: Using a case-control study, we quantitatively and qualitatively compared tau PET scans in 10 symptomatic and 3 asymptomatic MAPT mutation carriers (n = 13, age range 42-67 years) with clinically normal (CN) participants (n = 241, age range 42-67 years) and an Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia cohort (n = 30, age range 52-67 years). Eight participants had MAPT mutations that involved exon 10 (N279K n = 5, S305N n = 2, P301L n = 1) and tend to form 4R tau pathology, and 5 had mutations outside exon 10 (V337M n = 2, R406W n = 3) and tend to form mixed 3R/4R tau pathology. RESULTS: Tau PET signal was qualitatively and quantitatively different between participants with AD, CN participants, and MAPT mutation carriers, with the greatest signal intensity in those with AD and minimal regional signal in MAPT mutation carries with mutations in exon 10. However, MAPT mutation carriers with mutations outside exon 10 had uptake levels within the AD range, which was significantly higher than both MAPT mutation carriers with mutations in exon 10 and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Tau PET shows higher magnitude of binding in MAPT mutation carriers who harbor mutations that are more likely to produce AD-like tau pathology (e.g., in our series, the non-exon 10 families tend to accumulate mixed 3R/4R aggregates). Exon 10 splicing determines the balance of 3R and 4R tau isoforms, with some mutations involving exon 10 predisposing to a greater proportion of 4R aggregates and consequently a lower level of AV-1451 binding, as seen in this case series, thus supporting the notion that this tau PET ligand has specific binding properties for AD-like tau pathology.

29443891|t|Conformational Dynamics and Stability of U-Shaped and S-Shaped Amyloid beta Assemblies.
29443891|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the aggregation and deposition of Amyloid beta (Abeta) oligomers in the brain of patients. Two principal variants of Abeta exist in humans: Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42. The former is the most abundant in the plaques, while the latter is the most toxic species and forms fibrils more rapidly. Interestingly, fibrils of Abeta1-40 peptides can only assume U-shaped conformations while Abeta1-42 can also arrange as S-shaped three-stranded chains, as recently discovered. As alterations in protein conformational arrangement correlate with cell toxicity and speed of disease progression, it is important to characterize, at molecular level, the conformational dynamics of amyloid fibrils. In this work, Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics simulations were carried out to compare the conformational dynamics of U-shaped and S-shaped Abeta17-42 small fibrils. Our computational results provide support for the stability of the recently proposed S-shaped model due to the maximized interactions involving the C-terminal residues. On the other hand, the U-shaped motif is characterized by significant distortions resulting in a more disordered assembly. Outcomes of our work suggest that the molecular architecture of the protein aggregates might play a pivotal role in formation and conformational stability of the resulting fibrils.

29444819|t|BACE1 deletion in the adult mouse reverses preformed amyloid deposition and improves cognitive functions.
29444819|a|BACE1 initiates the generation of the beta-amyloid peptide, which likely causes Alzheimer's disease (AD) when accumulated abnormally. BACE1 inhibitory drugs are currently being developed to treat AD patients. To mimic BACE1 inhibition in adults, we generated BACE1 conditional knockout (BACE1fl/fl) mice and bred BACE1fl/fl mice with ubiquitin-CreER mice to induce deletion of BACE1 after passing early developmental stages. Strikingly, sequential and increased deletion of BACE1 in an adult AD mouse model (5xFAD) was capable of completely reversing amyloid deposition. This reversal in amyloid deposition also resulted in significant improvement in gliosis and neuritic dystrophy. Moreover, synaptic functions, as determined by long-term potentiation and contextual fear conditioning experiments, were significantly improved, correlating with the reversal of amyloid plaques. Our results demonstrate that sustained and increasing BACE1 inhibition in adults can reverse amyloid deposition in an AD mouse model, and this observation will help to provide guidance for the proper use of BACE1 inhibitors in human patients.

29448601|t|Probing Amyloid beta and the Antibody Interaction Using Atomic Force Microscopy.
29448601|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide is considered to be the critical causative factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) because the hydrophilic molecules accumulated outside of the neural cells and results in the formation of highly toxicity amyloid plaque. In this study, we probed the interaction between Abeta and the antibody using atomic force microscopy (AFM). We compared two kinds of antibodies which are the antibody for Abeta 1-42 (antibody42) and the antibody for Abeta 1-16 (antibody16). To detect the interaction between Abeta and the antibodies, the single molecular force spectroscopy was carried out using Abeta modified glass substrate and the antibodies modified AFM probes. In the results, the single Abeta-antibody42 dissociation constant was estimated to be 5.2 x 10-3 s-1 and the single Abeta-antibody16 dissociation constant was 2.8x10-2 s-1. The Abeta-antibody42 showed 5.3 times longer bond life time compare with Abeta-antibody16. It suggested that antibody42 is better choice for the Abeta sensor development.

29453052|t|Ac-LVFFARK-NH2 conjugation to beta-cyclodextrin exhibits significantly enhanced performance on inhibiting amyloid beta-protein fibrillogenesis and cytotoxicity.
29453052|a|Inhibition of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) aggregation is of significance for the potential treatment of Alzheimer's disease. We have herein conjugated heptapeptide Ac-LVFFARK-NH2 (LK7) to beta-cyclodextrin (betaCyD) and studied the inhibitory effect of the LK7-betaCyD conjugate on Abeta aggregation. The conjugation significantly improved the peptide solubility and suppressed the self-assembly propensity. This led to 30% increase of the binding affinity of LK7 for Abeta in the conjugate due to increased hydrophobic interactions. Thus, LK7-betaCyD suppressed the conformational transition of Abeta and showed stronger inhibitory effect on Abeta fibrillation than LK7. Thus, LK7-betaCyD exhibited protective effect on Abeta40-induced cytotoxicity, and the cells completely survived at 10 molar excess of LK7-betaCyD (from 67% to 100%). By contrast, LK7 showed only a moderate inhibition on Abeta fibrillation, and could not inhibit the amyloid cytotoxicity. The research proved that conjugation of hydrophobic peptide to betaCyD was promising to increase its inhibition potency against Abeta aggregation.

29454025|t|Early alteration of distribution and activity of hippocampal type-1 cannabinoid receptor in Alzheimer's disease-like mice overexpressing the human mutant amyloid precursor protein.
29454025|a|Besides its involvement in Alzheimer's disease (AD) as precursor of the neurotoxic amyloid peptides, the pathophysiological impact of brain accumulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) is not yet well understood. Recent studies reported that APP interacts with other membrane proteins, including G protein coupled receptors, affecting their biological functions. Here, we focused on the study of the potential impact of human mutant APP on expression, distribution and activity of type-1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptor in the hippocampus of Tg2576 mice, an AD-like mice model. By using biochemical and electrophysiological measures, we found that in a presymptomatic phase, when amyloid plaques have not yet formed and there is no sign of cognitive deficits, the over-expression of full-length APP in the hippocampus of Tg2576 mice altered membrane localization and inhibitory signalling activity of CB1 receptor, possibly by binding to the receptor and reducing its specific interaction with caveolin-1 and G proteins.

29458025|t|Cell model for the identification and characterization of prion-like components from Alzheimer brain tissue.
29458025|a|Intracerebral injection of brain extracts from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients into appropriate mouse models was previously found to drastically accelerate the deposition of Abeta amyloid in the recipient animals indicating a prion-like activity. In this study we show that this prion-like activity can be also identified by using a cell culture model of Abeta plaque formation. Analysis of biochemical fractions of AD brain extract indicate that the seeding-activity correlated with the presence of Abeta peptide and Abeta-derived aggregates. In vitro-formed fibrils were also active but their activity was low and depending on the fibril structure and conditions of fibril formation. Our data indicate a conformational basis of the observed seeding effect and suggest the utility of our cell model for further studies on the prion-like activity of AD extracts.

29458036|t|Plasma amyloid levels within the Alzheimer's process and correlations with central biomarkers.
29458036|a|INTRODUCTION: Diagnostic relevance of plasma amyloid beta (Abeta) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) process yields conflicting results. The objective of the study was to assess plasma levels of Abeta42 and Abeta40 in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), nonamnestic MCI, and AD patients and to investigate relationships between peripheral and central biomarkers. METHODS: One thousand forty participants (417 amnestic MCI, 122 nonamnestic MCI, and 501 AD) from the Biomarker of AmyLoid pepTide and AlZheimer's diseAse Risk multicenter prospective study with cognition, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and magnetic resonance imaging assessments were included. RESULTS: Plasma Abeta1-42 and Abeta1-40 were lower in AD (36.9 [11.7] and 263 [80] pg/mL) than in amnestic MCI (38.2 [11.9] and 269 [68] pg/mL) than in nonamnestic MCI (39.7 [10.5] and 272 [52] pg/mL), respectively (P = .01 for overall difference between groups for Abeta1-42 and P = .04 for Abeta1-40). Globally, plasma Abeta1-42 correlated with age, Mini-Mental State Examination, and APOE epsilon4 allele. Plasma Abeta1-42 correlated with all CSF biomarkers in MCI but only with CSF Abeta42 in AD. DISCUSSION: Plasma Abeta was associated with cognitive status and CSF biomarkers, suggesting the interest of plasma amyloid biomarkers for diagnosis purpose.

29458418|t|Amyloid beta-induced impairments on mitochondrial dynamics, hippocampal neurogenesis, and memory are restored by phosphodiesterase 7 inhibition.
29458418|a|BACKGROUND: The phosphodiesterase (PDE) 7 inhibitor S14 is a cell-permeable small heterocyclic molecule that is able to cross the blood-brain barrier. We previously found that intraperitoneal treatment with S14 exerted neuroprotection in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) model (in APP/PS1 mice). The objective of this study was to investigate the neurogenic and cellular effects of oral administration of S14 on amyloid beta (Abeta) overload. METHODS: We orally administered the PDE7 inhibitor S14 (15 mg/kg/day) or vehicle in 6-month-old APP/PS1 mice. After 5 weeks of S14 treatment, we evaluated cognitive functions and brain tissues. We also assessed the effects of S14 on the Abeta-treated human neuroblastome SH-SY5Y cell line. RESULTS: Targeting the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) pathway, S14 rescued cognitive decline by improving hippocampal neurogenesis in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Additionally, S14 treatment reverted the Abeta-induced reduction in mitochondrial mass in APP/PS1 mice and in the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells co-exposed to Abeta. The restoration of the mitochondrial mass was found to be a dual effect of S14: a rescue of the mitochondrial biogenesis formerly slowed down by Abeta overload, and a reduction in the Abeta-increased mitochondrial clearance mechanism of mitophagy. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we show new therapeutic effects of the PDE7 inhibitor, confirming S14 as a potential therapeutic drug for AD.

29459944|t|Association of Changes in Plasma Neurofilament Light and Tau Levels With Anesthesia and Surgery: Results From the CAPACITY and ARCADIAN Studies.
29459944|a|Importance: Anesthesia and surgery are believed to act on the central nervous system by a fully reversible mechanism innocuous to nerve cells. Evidence that neurological sequelae may follow would challenge this belief and would thereby suggest a need to reassess theories of the mechanism of anesthetic action or the response of the central nervous system to surgery. Objective: To measure 2 biomarkers of neurological injury (neurofilament light and tau) in plasma in a series of timed collections before and after anesthesia and surgery. Design, Setting, and Participants: These 2 related observational studies (CAPACITY and ARCADIAN) recruited patients 60 years and older who were undergoing general anesthesia for surgeries performed within a tertiary hospital. Blood samples were taken immediately before surgical anesthesia was administered and then sequentially after surgery at 30-minute, 6-hour, 24-hour, and 48-hour intervals. Sampling took place from January 2014 to August 2015. Data analysis took place from October 2016 to February 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: Plasma neurofilament light and tau. Results: A total of 30 patients were enrolled (13 from the CAPACITY study and 17 from the ARCADIAN study). The mean (SD) age was 69.1 (7.0) years, and 18 members (59%) of the participant group were female; 22 (73%) were undergoing joint arthroplasty. Mean neurofilament light increased at each measurement from a combined baseline mean (SD) of 22.3 (20.4) pg/mL to a maximal combined mean (SD) level of 35.1 (28.7) pg/mL, a maximum increase of 67% (95% CI, 45%-89%; P < .001), at 48 hours postoperatively. The level of tau increased significantly from baseline at every measurement, from a combined baseline mean (SD) of 3.1 (1.3) pg/mL to a maximal combined mean (SD) of 10.8 (9.5) pg/mL, a peak increase of 257% (95% CI, 154%-361%; P < .001), at 6 hours postoperatively. After 6 hours, the mean level began to return to baseline but remained elevated after 48 hours. Conclusions and Relevance: Neurofilament light is a specific marker of axonal injury and has been shown to indicate neuronal damage in a number of diseases. Tau proteins are an integral component of axonal integrity, and increased tau indicates neuronal damage. The increases in both neurofilament light and tau over 48 hours after surgery suggest that general anesthesia and surgery may be associated with neuronal damage in the short term. Further investigations will be required to study any association with clinical outcomes. These preliminary findings demand that we question the prevailing assumption that anesthesia and surgery are innocuous, transient, and without injurious changes to the central nervous system.

29462334|t|Left frontal hub connectivity delays cognitive impairment in autosomal-dominant and sporadic Alzheimer's disease.
29462334|a|Patients with Alzheimer's disease vary in their ability to sustain cognitive abilities in the presence of brain pathology. A major open question is which brain mechanisms may support higher reserve capacity, i.e. relatively high cognitive performance at a given level of Alzheimer's pathology. Higher functional MRI-assessed functional connectivity of a hub in the left frontal cortex is a core candidate brain mechanism underlying reserve as it is associated with education (i.e. a protective factor often associated with higher reserve) and attenuated cognitive impairment in prodromal Alzheimer's disease. However, no study has yet assessed whether such hub connectivity of the left frontal cortex supports reserve throughout the evolution of pathological brain changes in Alzheimer's disease, including the presymptomatic stage when cognitive decline is subtle. To address this research gap, we obtained cross-sectional resting state functional MRI in 74 participants with autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease, 55 controls from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network and 75 amyloid-positive elderly participants, as well as 41 amyloid-negative cognitively normal elderly subjects from the German Center of Neurodegenerative Diseases multicentre study on biomarkers in sporadic Alzheimer's disease. For each participant, global left frontal cortex connectivity was computed as the average resting state functional connectivity between the left frontal cortex (seed) and each voxel in the grey matter. As a marker of disease stage, we applied estimated years from symptom onset in autosomal dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease and cerebrospinal fluid tau levels in sporadic Alzheimer's disease cases. In both autosomal dominant and sporadic Alzheimer's disease patients, higher levels of left frontal cortex connectivity were correlated with greater education. For autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease, a significant left frontal cortex connectivity x estimated years of onset interaction was found, indicating slower decline of memory and global cognition at higher levels of connectivity. Similarly, in sporadic amyloid-positive elderly subjects, the effect of tau on cognition was attenuated at higher levels of left frontal cortex connectivity. Polynomial regression analysis showed that the trajectory of cognitive decline was shifted towards a later stage of Alzheimer's disease in patients with higher levels of left frontal cortex connectivity. Together, our findings suggest that higher resilience against the development of cognitive impairment throughout the early stages of Alzheimer's disease is at least partially attributable to higher left frontal cortex-hub connectivity.

29462572|t|Lactobacilli and bifidobacteria ameliorate memory and learning deficits and oxidative stress in beta-amyloid (1-42) injected rats.
29462572|a|The gastrointestinal microbiota affects brain function, including memory and learning. In this study we investigated the effects of probiotics on memory and oxidative stress biomarkers in an experimental model of Alzheimer's disease. Sixty rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: control; control-probiotics, which received probiotics for 8 weeks; sham operation, which received an intrahippocampal injection of phosphate-buffered saline; Alzheimer, which received an intrahippocampal injection of beta-amyloid (Abeta1-42); and Alzheimer-probiotics, which in addition to being injected with Abeta1-42, received 2 g (1 x 1010 CFU/g) of probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. fermentum, Bifidobacterium lactis, and B. longum) for 8 weeks. Memory and learning were measured using the Morris water maze, and oxidative stress biomarkers in the hippocampus were measured using ELISA kits. Morris water maze results indicated that compared with the Alzheimer group, the Alzheimer-probiotics group had significantly improved spatial memory, including shorter escape latency and travelled distance and greater time spent in the target quadrant. There was also improvement in oxidative stress biomarkers such as increased malondialdehyde levels and superoxide dismutase activity following the beta-amyloid injection. Overall, it seems that probiotics play a role in improving memory deficit and inhibiting the pathological mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease by modifying microbiota.

29463708|t|Environmental enrichment and exercise are better than social enrichment to reduce memory deficits in amyloid beta neurotoxicity.
29463708|a|Recently, nongenetic animal models to study the onset and development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have appeared, such as the intrahippocampal infusion of peptides present in Alzheimer amyloid plaques [i.e., amyloid-beta (Abeta)]. Nonpharmacological approaches to AD treatment also have been advanced recently, which involve combinations of behavioral interventions whose specific effects are often difficult to determine. Here we isolate the neuroprotective effects of three of these interventions-environmental enrichment (EE), anaerobic physical exercise (AnPE), and social enrichment (SE)-on Abeta-induced oxidative stress and on impairments in learning and memory induced by Abeta. Wistar rats were submitted to 8 wk of EE, AnPE, or SE, followed by Abeta infusion in the dorsal hippocampus. Short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM) of object recognition (OR) and social recognition (SR) were evaluated. Biochemical assays determined hippocampal oxidative status: reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation by thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) test, and total antioxidant capacity by ferric reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP), as well as acetylcholinesterase activity. Abeta infusion resulted in memory deficits and hippocampal oxidative damage. EE and AnPE prevented all memory deficits (STM and LTM of OR and SR) and lipid peroxidation (i.e., TBARS). SE prevented only the SR memory deficits and the decrease of total antioxidant capacity decrease (i.e., FRAP). Traditionally, findings obtained with EE protocols do not allow discrimination of the roles of the three individual factors involved. Here we demonstrate that EE and physical exercise have better neuroprotective effects than SE in memory deficits related to Abeta neurotoxicity in the AD model tested.

29464543|t|Detection of Amyloid Beta (Abeta) Oligomeric Composition Using Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MALDI MS).
29464543|a|The use of MALDI MS as a fast and direct method to detect the Abeta oligomers of different masses is examined in this paper. Experimental results suggest that Abeta oligomers are ionized and detected as singly charged ions, and thus, the resulting mass spectrum directly reports the oligomer size distribution. Validation experiments were performed to verify the MS data against artifacts. Mass spectra collected from modified Abeta peptides with different propensities for aggregation were compared. Generally, the relative intensities of multimers were higher from samples where oligomerization was expected to be more favorable, and vice versa. MALDI MS was also able to detect the differences in oligomeric composition before and after the incubation/oligomerization step. Such differences in sample composition were also independently confirmed with an in vitro Abeta toxicity study on primary rat cortical neurons. An additional validation was accomplished through removal of oligomers from the sample using molecular weight cutoff filters; the resulting MS data correctly reflected the removal at the expected cutoff points. The results collectively validated the ability of MALDI MS to assess the monomeric/multimeric composition of Abeta samples. Graphical Abstract  .

29467574|t|A hydrogel biosensor for high selective and sensitive detection of amyloid-beta oligomers.
29467574|a|Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive and memory impairment. It is the most common neurological disease that causes dementia. Soluble amyloid-beta oligomers (AbetaO) in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are the pathogenic biomarker correlated with AD. Methods: A simple electrochemical biosensor using graphene oxide/gold nanoparticles (GNPs) hydrogel electrode was developed in this study. Thiolated cellular prion protein (PrPC) peptide probe was immobilized on GNPs of the hydrogel electrode to construct an AbetaO biosensor. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was utilized for AbetaO analysis. Results: The specific binding between AbetaO and PrPC probes on the hydrogel electrode resulted in an increase in the electron-transfer resistance. The biosensor showed high specificity and sensitivity for AbetaO detection. It could selectively differentiate AbetaO from amyloid-beta (Abeta) monomers or fibrils. Meanwhile, it was highly sensitive to detect as low as 0.1 pM AbetaO in artificial CSF or blood plasma. The linear range for AbetaO detection is from 0.1 pM to 10 nM. Conclusion: This biosensor could be used as a cost-effective tool for early diagnosis of AD due to its high electrochemical performance and bionic structure.

29471214|t|Joint associations of beta-amyloidosis and cortical thickness with cognition.
29471214|a|In 1164 cognitively unimpaired persons, aged 50-95 years, from the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, we examined the relationships of baseline cognition and cognitive changes across the full range of cortical thickness of an Alzheimer signature region of interest and global beta-amyloid levels measured by Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography (PIB PET) standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR). In machine-learning models accounting for both biomarkers simultaneously, worsening biomarker values were additive and associated with lower baseline global cognition and greater subsequent decline in global cognition. Associations between Alzheimer's disease signature cortical thickness or PIB PET beta-amyloid SUVR and baseline cognition were mainly linear. Lower Alzheimer's disease signature cortical thickness values across the entire range of thickness predicted future decline in global cognitive scores, demonstrating its close relationship to cognitive functioning. PIB PET beta-amyloid SUVR also predicted cognitive decline across its full range, even when cortical thickness was accounted for. PIB PET beta-amyloid's relationship to cognitive decline was nonlinear, more prominent at lower beta-amyloid levels and less prominent at higher beta-amyloid levels.

29472606|t|Nanogels of dual inhibitor-modified hyaluronic acid function as a potent inhibitor of amyloid beta-protein aggregation and cytotoxicity.
29472606|a|Inhibition of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) aggregation is considered as a promising strategy for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and curcumin have been recognized as effective inhibitors of Abeta aggregation. Herein, we proposed dual-inhibitor modification of hyaluronic acid (HA) to explore the synergistic effect of the two inhibitors. EGCG-modified HA (EHA) formed dispersed hydrogel structures, while EGCG-curcumin bi-modified HA (CEHA) self-assembled into nanogels like curcumin-modified HA (CHA). Thioflavin T fluorescent assays revealed that the inhibitory effect of CEHA was 69% and 55% higher than EHA and CHA, respectively, and cytotoxicity assays showed that the viability of SH-SY5Y cells incubated with Abeta and CEHA was 28% higher than that with Abeta and the mixture of EHA and CHA. These results clearly indicate the synergism of the two inhibitors. It is considered that the difference in the hydrophobicities of the two inhibitors made the bi-modification of HA provide a favorable CEHA nanostructure that coordinated different inhibition effects of the two inhibitors. This research indicates that fabrication of dual-inhibitor nanosystem is promising for the development of potent agents against Abeta aggregation and cytotoxicity.

29476081|t|Amyloid-beta with isomerized Asp7 cytotoxicity is coupled to protein phosphorylation.
29476081|a|Neuronal dysfunction and loss associated with the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the form of extracellular amyloid plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau in the form of intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles represent key features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid plaques found in the brains of AD patients are predominantly composed of Abeta42 and its multiple chemically or structurally modified isoforms. Recently, we demonstrated that Abeta42 with isomerised Asp7 (isoAbeta42) which is one of the most abundant Abeta isoform in plaques, exhibited high neurotoxicity in human neuronal cells. Here, we show that, in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, the administration of synthetic isoAbeta42 rather than intact Abeta42 resulted in a significantly higher level of protein phosphorylation, especially the phosphorylation of tau, tubulins, and matrin 3. IsoAbeta42 induced a drastic reduction of tau protein levels. Our data demonstrate, for the first time, that isoAbeta42, being to date the only known synthetic Abeta species to cause AD-like amyloidogenesis in an animal AD model, induced cell death by disabling structural proteins in a manner characteristic of that observed in the neurons of AD patients. The data emphasize an important role of isoAbeta42 in AD progression and provide possible neurotoxicity paths for this particular isoform.

29476859|t|Stoichiometric Zn2+ interferes with the self-association of Abeta42: Insights from size distribution analysis.
29476859|a|The abnormal aggregation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides in the brain has been recognized as a central event in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Divalent metal ions such as Zn2+ have been shown to be closely involved in modulating Abeta self-association. Although the link between Zn2+ dyshomeostasis and brain Abeta deposition has been established, the effect of Zn2+ on the aggregation of Abeta is still incompletely clarified. By combining analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC), circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, thioflavin T (ThT) assay and atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging, we analyzed the impact of stoichiometric Zn2+ on the aggregation process of Abeta42, the main toxic isoform of Abeta species in the brain. Abeta42 aggregates found in the presence of Zn2+ were smaller in size, non-fibrillary and showed less beta-sheet structures than aggregates formed in absence of Zn2+. AUC showed that Zn2+ was capable of retaining monomeric Abeta42 in solution. Zn2+ chelation by EDTA totally reversed the inhibitory effect of Zn2+ on Abeta42 fibrillation. Our results provide further evidence that Zn2+ shifts the self-association of Abeta42 toward a non-fibrillary pathway by interfering with the aggregation process at multiple levels.

29477125|t|Enantiomeric lignans with anti-beta-amyloid aggregation activity from the twigs and leaves of Pithecellobium clypearia Benth.
29477125|a|To develop potential agents for slowing the progression of Alzheimer's disease, two pairs of new enantiomeric lignans, including a couple of rarely 8',9'-dinor-3',7-epoxy-8,4'-oxyneolignanes named (7S, 8S)- and (7R, 8R)-pithecellobiumin A (1a/1b) and a pair of 2',9'-epoxy-arylnaphthalenes named (7R, 8R, 8'R)- and (7S, 8S, 8'S)-pithecellobiumin B (2a/2b) were separated by chiral high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Their planar structures were elucidated by spectroscopic data analyses. The absolute configurations were determined by comparing of experimental and calculated electronic circular dichroism (ECD). The inhibitory activity on Abeta aggregation of all optical pure compounds was tested by ThT assay. Interestingly, enantiomeric inhibitors 1a (62.1%) and 1b (81.6%) exhibited different degrees of anti-Abeta aggregation activity. However, 2a (65.4%) and 2b (68.4%) showed similar inhibition rate. The different inhibition profiles were explained by molecular dynamics and docking simulation studies.

29477284|t|Early striatal amyloid deposition distinguishes Down syndrome and autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease from late-onset amyloid deposition.
29477284|a|INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to evaluate amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition patterns in different groups of cerebral beta amyloidosis: (1) nondemented with amyloid precursor protein overproduction (Down syndrome); (2) nondemented with abnormal processing of amyloid precursor protein (preclinical autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease); (3) presumed alteration in Abeta clearance with clinical symptoms (late-onset AD); and (4) presumed alterations in Abeta clearance (preclinical AD). METHODS: We performed whole-brain voxelwise comparison of cerebral Abeta between 23 Down syndrome, 10 preclinical autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease, 17 late-onset AD, and 16 preclinical AD subjects, using Pittsburgh Compound B-positron emission tomography. RESULTS: We found both Down syndrome and preclinical autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease shared a distinct pattern of increased bilateral striatal and thalamic Abeta deposition compared to late-onset AD and preclinical AD. CONCLUSION: Disorders associated with early-life alterations in amyloid precursor protein production or processing are associated with a distinct pattern of early striatal fibrillary Abeta deposition before significant cognitive impairment. A better understanding of this unique pattern could identify important mechanisms of Abeta deposition and possibly important targets for early intervention.

29477545|t|Neurosteroid metabolites of testosterone and progesterone differentially inhibit ERK phosphorylation induced by amyloid beta in SH-SY5Y cells and primary cortical neurons.
29477545|a|Gonadal steroid hormones exert neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects on the brain. Recent work suggests potential neuroprotective roles for the 3alpha-hydroxy, 5alpha-reduced metabolites of these hormones. Two such metabolites are 5alpha-androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol (3alpha-diol) and 5alpha-pregnan-3alpha-ol-20-one (allopregnanolone; Allo), which may contribute to the overall protection conferred by their precursors (testosterone and progesterone, respectively) through mechanisms including potentiation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor (GABAAR) activity. We have previously demonstrated that physiological concentrations of 3alpha-diol inhibit prolonged phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and the associated neurotoxicity resulting from amyloid beta peptide 1-42 (Abeta42) exposure in vitro. In the present study, we sought to characterize the GABAAR-dependency of 3alpha-diol's effects, compared to those of Allo, in SH-SY5Y human female neuroblastoma cells and primary cortical neurons isolated from postnatal day 0-1 mice. Both 3alpha-diol and Allo prevented Abeta42-mediated ERK phosphorylation in SH-SY5Y cells, with substantially different concentration requirements (10 nM for 3alpha-diol, 100 nM for Allo). Pharmacological inhibition of GABAAR with picrotoxin did not prevent this effect, indicating that neurosteroid-mediated ERK inhibition in SH-SY5Y cells may be GABAAR-independent. While 10 nM and 100 nM concentrations of both neurosteroids inhibited ERK phosphorylation induced by Abeta42 in primary cortical neurons, which have high expression levels of GABAARs, only the effects of Allo were significantly inhibited by picrotoxin. These results suggest that neurosteroid metabolites of testosterone and progesterone may contribute to neuroprotection by suppressing ERK phosphorylation through both GABAAR-dependent and -independent mechanisms.

29478713|t|Tokishakuyakusan ameliorates spatial memory deficits induced by ovariectomy combined with beta-amyloid in rats.
29478713|a|Previously, we reported that ovariectomy (OVX) combined with beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) impaired spatial memory by decreasing extracellular acetylcholine (ACh) levels in the dorsal hippocampus. Here, we investigated the effect of tokishakuyakusan (TSS), a Kampo medicine, on the impairment of spatial memory induced by OVX combined with Abeta in rats. Repeated administration of TSS (300 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly decreased the number of errors in the eight-arm radial maze test. Though TSS had no effect on extracellular ACh levels at baseline, TSS significantly increased extracellular ACh levels in the dorsal hippocampus. These results suggest that TSS improves the impairment of spatial memory induced by OVX combined with Abeta by (at least in part) increasing extracellular ACh levels in the dorsal hippocampus.

29478851|t|Drosophila Full-Length Amyloid Precursor Protein Is Required for Visual Working Memory and Prevents Age-Related Memory Impairment.
29478851|a|The beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays a central role in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, its normal physiological functions are still unclear. APP is cleaved by various secretases whereby sequential processing by the beta- and gamma-secretases produces the beta-amyloid peptide that is accumulating in plaques that typify AD. In addition, this produces secreted N-terminal sAPPbeta fragments and the APP intracellular domain (AICD). Alternative cleavage by alpha-secretase results in slightly longer secreted sAPPalpha fragments and the identical AICD. Whereas the AICD has been connected with transcriptional regulation, sAPPalpha fragments have been suggested to have a neurotrophic and neuroprotective role [1]. Moreover, expression of sAPPalpha in APP-deficient mice could rescue their deficits in learning, spatial memory, and long-term potentiation [2]. Loss of the Drosophila APP-like (APPL) protein impairs associative olfactory memory formation and middle-term memory that can be rescued with a secreted APPL fragment [3]. We now show that APPL is also essential for visual working memory. Interestingly, this short-term memory declines rapidly with age, and this is accompanied by enhanced processing of APPL in aged flies. Furthermore, reducing secretase-mediated proteolytic processing of APPL can prevent the age-related memory loss, whereas overexpression of the secretases aggravates the aging effect. Rescue experiments confirmed that this memory requires signaling of full-length APPL and that APPL negatively regulates the neuronal-adhesion molecule Fasciclin 2. Overexpression of APPL or one of its secreted N termini results in a dominant-negative interaction with the FASII receptor. Therefore, our results show that specific memory processes require distinct APPL products.

29480181|t|Assessment of the Genetic Architecture of Alzheimer's Disease Risk in Rate of Memory Decline.
29480181|a|Many genetic studies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been focused on the identification of common genetic variants associated with AD risk and not on other aspects of the disease, such as age at onset or rate of dementia progression. There are multiple approaches to untangling the genetic architecture of these phenotypes. We hypothesized that the genetic architecture of rate of progression is different than the risk for developing AD dementia. To test this hypothesis, we used longitudinal clinical data from ADNI and the Knight-ADRC at Washington University, and we calculated PRS (polygenic risk score) based on the IGAP study to compare the genetic architecture of AD risk and dementia progression. Dementia progression was measured by the change of Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR)-SB per year. Out of the 21 loci for AD risk, no association with the rate of dementia progression was found. The PRS rate was significantly associated with the rate of dementia progression (beta= 0.146, p = 0.03). In the case of rare variants, TREM2 (beta= 0.309, p = 0.02) was also associated with the rate of dementia progression. TREM2 variant carriers showed a 23% faster rate of dementia compared with non-variant carriers. In conclusion, our results indicate that the recently identified common and rare variants for AD susceptibility have a limited impact on the rate of dementia progression in AD patients.

29480197|t|Biallelic Loss of Function of SORL1 in an Early Onset Alzheimer's Disease Patient.
29480197|a|Heterozygous SORL1 protein truncating variants (PTV) are a strong risk factor for early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD). In case control studies performed at the genome-wide level, PTV definition is usually straightforward. Regarding splice site variants, only those affecting canonical sites are typically included. Some other variants, not annotated as PTV, could, however, affect splicing and hence result in a loss of SORL1 function. We took advantage of the whole exome sequencing data from the 9/484 patients with a previously reported SORL1 PTV in the French EOAD series and searched for a second variant which may affect splicing and eventually result in more than 50% loss of function overall. We found that one patient, known to carry a variant predicted to disrupt the canonical 5' splice site of exon 8, also carried a second novel intronic variant predicted to affect SORL1 splicing of exon 29. Segregation analysis showed that the second variant was located in trans from the known PTV. We performed ex vivo minigene splicing assays and showed that both variants led to the generation of transcripts containing a premature stop codon. This is therefore the first evidence of a human carrying biallelic SORL1 PTV. This patient had a family history of dementia in both maternal and paternal lineages with later ages of onset than the proband himself. However, his 55 years age at onset was in the same ranges as previously published SORL1 heterozygous PTV carriers. This suggests that biallelic loss of SORL1 function is an extremely rare event that was not associated with a dramatically earlier age at onset than heterozygous SORL1 loss-of-function variant carriers, in this single patient.

29482212|t|Proximity to Parental Symptom Onset and Amyloid-beta Burden in Sporadic Alzheimer Disease.
29482212|a|Importance: Alzheimer disease (AD) develops during several decades. Presymptomatic individuals might be the best candidates for clinical trials, but their identification is challenging because they have no symptoms. Objective: To assess whether a sporadic parental estimated years to symptom onset calculation could be used to identify information about amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels in asymptomatic individuals with a parental history of AD dementia. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study analyzed Abeta1-42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens from 101 cognitively normal individuals who had a lumbar puncture as part of the Presymptomatic Evaluation of Novel or Experimental Treatments for Alzheimer Disease (PREVENT-AD) cohort from September 1, 2011, through November 30, 2016 (374 participants were enrolled in the cohort during this period). The study estimated each participant's proximity to his/her parent's symptom onset by subtracting the index relative's onset age from his/her current age. The association between proximity to parental symptom onset and Abeta levels was then assessed using apolipoprotein E epsilon4 (APOE4) status and sex as interactive terms. These analyses were performed again in 2 independent cohorts using CSF and Pittsburgh compound B carbon 11-labeled positron emission tomography (PIB-PET) Abeta biomarkers: the Adult Children Study (ACS) and the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer Prevention (WRAP) cohorts. Main Outcomes and Measures: The association between proximity to parental symptom onset and Abeta burden in asymptomatic individuals with a parental history of sporadic AD. Results: The present analysis included a subset of 101 PREVENT-AD individuals (mean [SD] age, 61.8 [5.1] years; 30 [29.7%] male), 128 ACS participants (112 participants underwent CSF measurement: mean [SD] age, 63.4 [5.1] years; 31 [27.7%] male; and 107 underwent PIB-PET: mean [SD] age, 64.6 [5.3] years; 27 [25.2%] male), and 135 WRAP participants (85 participants underwent CSF measurement: mean [SD] age, 59.9 [6.0] years; 27 [31.8%] male; and 135 underwent PIB-PET: mean [SD] age, 59.6 [6.1] years; 43 [31.9%] male). In the PREVENT-AD cohort, individuals approaching their parent's onset age had lower CSF Abeta1-42 levels (range, 402-1597; B = -9.09, P = .04). This association was stronger in APOE4 carriers (B = -17.9, P = .03) and women (B = -19.8, P = .02). In the ACS cohort, the main association was replicated using PIB-PET data, and the sex interaction was replicated using CSF and PIB-PET data. In the WRAP cohort, the results were not replicated using cross-sectional data, but the main association and the APOE interaction were replicated using PIB-PET longitudinal data. Conclusions and Relevance: These results suggest that proximity to parental symptom onset may help estimate Abeta biomarker changes in women or APOE4 carrier asymptomatic individuals with a parental history of sporadic AD.

29482324|t|Energy Landscapes for the Aggregation of Abeta17-42.
29482324|a|The aggregation of the Abeta peptide (Abeta1-42) to form fibrils is a key feature of Alzheimer's disease. The mechanism is thought to be a nucleation stage followed by an elongation process. The elongation stage involves the consecutive addition of monomers to one end of the growing fibril. The aggregation process proceeds in a stop-and-go fashion and may involve off-pathway aggregates, complicating experimental and computational studies. Here we present exploration of a well-defined region in the free and potential energy landscapes for the Abeta17-42 pentamer. We find that the ideal aggregation process agrees with the previously reported dock-lock mechanism. We also analyze a large number of additional stable structures located on the multifunnel energy landscape, which constitute kinetic traps. The key contributors to the formation of such traps are misaligned strong interactions, for example the stacking of F19 and F20, as well as entropic contributions. Our results suggest that folding templates for aggregation are a necessity and that aggregation studies could employ such species to obtain a more detailed description of the process.

29483128|t|ApoE facilitates the microglial response to amyloid plaque pathology.
29483128|a|One of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease is the presence of extracellular diffuse and fibrillar plaques predominantly consisting of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) influences the deposition of amyloid pathology through affecting the clearance and aggregation of monomeric Abeta in the brain. In addition to influencing Abeta metabolism, increasing evidence suggests that apoE influences microglial function in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we characterize the impact that apoE has on amyloid pathology and the innate immune response in APPPS1DeltaE9 and APPPS1-21 transgenic mice. We report that Apoe deficiency reduced fibrillar plaque deposition, consistent with previous studies. However, fibrillar plaques in Apoe-deficient mice exhibited a striking reduction in plaque compaction. Hyperspectral fluorescent imaging using luminescent conjugated oligothiophenes identified distinct Abeta morphotypes in Apoe-deficient mice. We also observed a significant reduction in fibrillar plaque-associated microgliosis and activated microglial gene expression in Apoe-deficient mice, along with significant increases in dystrophic neurites around fibrillar plaques. Our results suggest that apoE is critical in stimulating the innate immune response to amyloid pathology.

29487280|t|Reduction of Abeta Generation by Schisandrin B through Restraining Beta-Secretase 1 Transcription and Translation.
29487280|a|BACKGROUND Beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) is a rate-limiting enzyme in the generation of amyloid beta peptides, which are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has been reported that Schisandrin B could improve cognitive functions in animal models of AD, but the underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this research, in order to investigate the effects of Schisandrin B on amyloid-beta (Abeta) metabolism and its mechanisms, amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its proteolytic products were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), western blotting, and RT-PCR after incubation of N2a/Swe cells with Schisandrin B. RESULTS The results indicated that Schisandrin B can significantly reduce the level of secretion of Abeta40 and Abeta42 secreted in N2a/Swe cells. Additionally, there was nonsignificant change in APP level after Schisandrin B treatment. Treatment of Schisandrin B dramatically reduced the mRNA and protein expression levels of BACE1. Moreover, Schisandrin B treatment resulted in a reduction of protein level of sAPPbeta, an APP fragment cleavage by BACE1. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that Schisandrin B inhibits the transcription and translation of BACE1, suppresses the activity of BACE1, and ultimately attenuates Abeta generation, which provides a novel mechanism for the regulation of Abeta metabolism by Schisandrin B.

29488144|t|Anti-herpetic Medications and Reduced Risk of Dementia in Patients with Herpes Simplex Virus Infections-a Nationwide, Population-Based Cohort Study in Taiwan.
29488144|a|This retrospective cohort study is to investigate the association between herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections and dementia, and the effects of anti-herpetic medications on the risk involved, using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). We enrolled a total of 33,448 subjects, and identified 8362 with newly diagnosed HSV infections and 25,086 randomly selected sex- and age-matched controls without HSV infections in a ratio of 1:3, selected from January 1, to December 31, 2000. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to evaluate the risk of developing dementia in the HSV cohort. This analysis revealed an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.564 (95% CI: 2.351-2.795, P < 0.001) for the development of dementia in the HSV-infected cohort relative to the non-HSV cohort. Thus, patients with HSV infections may have a 2.56-fold increased risk of developing dementia. A risk reduction of dementia development in patients affected by HSV infections was found upon treatment with anti-herpetic medications (adjusted HR = 0.092 [95% CI 0.079-0.108], P < 0.001). The usage of anti-herpetic medications in the treatment of HSV infections was associated with a decreased risk of dementia. These findings could be a signal to clinicians caring for patients with HSV infections. Further research is, therefore, necessary to explore the underlying mechanism(s) of these associations.

29490247|t|Highly Disordered Amyloid-beta Monomer Probed by Single-Molecule FRET and MD Simulation.
29490247|a|Monomers of amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein are known to be disordered, but there is considerable controversy over the existence of residual or transient conformations that can potentially promote oligomerization and fibril formation. We employed single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) spectroscopy with site-specific dye labeling using an unnatural amino acid and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate conformations and dynamics of Abeta isoforms with 40 (Abeta40) and 42 residues (Abeta42). The FRET efficiency distributions of both proteins measured in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature show a single peak with very similar FRET efficiencies, indicating there is apparently only one state. 2D FRET efficiency-donor lifetime analysis reveals, however, that there is a broad distribution of rapidly interconverting conformations. Using nanosecond fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, we measured the timescale of the fluctuations between these conformations to be ~35 ns, similar to that of disordered proteins. These results suggest that both Abeta40 and Abeta42 populate an ensemble of rapidly reconfiguring unfolded states, with no long-lived conformational state distinguishable from that of the disordered ensemble. To gain molecular-level insights into these observations, we performed molecular dynamics simulations with a force field optimized to describe disordered proteins. We find, as in experiments, that both peptides populate configurations consistent with random polymer chains, with the vast majority of conformations lacking significant secondary structure, giving rise to very similar ensemble-averaged FRET efficiencies.

29490706|t|Early long-term administration of the CSF1R inhibitor PLX3397 ablates microglia and reduces accumulation of intraneuronal amyloid, neuritic plaque deposition and pre-fibrillar oligomers in 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
29490706|a|BACKGROUND: Besides the two main classical features of amyloid beta aggregation and tau-containing neurofibrillary tangle deposition, neuroinflammation plays an important yet unclear role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Microglia are believed to be key mediators of neuroinflammation during AD and responsible for the regulation of brain homeostasis by balancing neurotoxicity and neuroprotective events. We have previously reported evidence that neuritic plaques are derived from dead neurons that have accumulated intraneuronal amyloid and further recruit Iba1-positive cells, which play a role in either neuronal demise or neuritic plaque maturation or both. METHODS: To study the impact of microglia on neuritic plaque development, we treated two-month-old 5XFAD mice with a selective colony stimulation factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor, PLX3397, for a period of 3 months, resulting in a significant ablation of microglia. Directly after this treatment, we analyzed the amount of intraneuronal amyloid and neuritic plaques and performed behavioral studies including Y-maze, fear conditioning and elevated plus maze. RESULTS: We found that early long-term PLX3397 administration results in a dramatic reduction of both intraneuronal amyloid as well as neuritic plaque deposition. PLX3397 treated young 5XFAD mice also displayed a significant decrease of soluble fibrillar amyloid oligomers in brain lysates, a depletion of soluble pre-fibrillar oligomers in plasma and an improvement in cognitive function measured by fear conditioning tests. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that CSF1R signaling, either directly on neurons or mediated by microglia, is crucial for the accumulation of intraneuronal amyloid and formation of neuritic plaques, suggesting that these two events are serially linked in a causal pathway leading to neurodegeneration and neuritic plaque formation. CSF1R inhibitors represent potential preventative or therapeutic approach that target the very earliest stages of the formation of intraneuronal amyloid and neuritic plaques.

29491368|t|Targeting glucocorticoid receptors prevents the effects of early life stress on amyloid pathology and cognitive performance in APP/PS1 mice.
29491368|a|Exposure to chronic stress or elevated glucocorticoid hormone levels in adult life has been associated with cognitive deficits and an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since exposure to stress during early life enhances stress-responsiveness and lastingly affects cognition in adult life, we here investigated; (i) whether chronic early life stress (ELS) affects AD pathology and cognition in middle-aged APPswe/PS1dE9 mice, and (ii) whether it is still possible to rescue these late effects by briefly blocking glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) at a translationally relevant, middle age. Transgenic APPswe/PS1dE9 mice were subjected to ELS by housing dams and pups with limited nesting and bedding material from postnatal days 2-9 only. In 6- and 12-month-old offspring, this resulted in enhanced hippocampal amyloid-beta (Abeta)-40 and -42 levels, and in reduced cognitive flexibility, that correlated well with the Abeta42 levels. In parallel, CORT levels and BACE1 levels were significantly elevated. Surprisingly, blocking GRs for only 3 days at 12 months of age reduced CORT levels, reduced hippocampal Abeta40 and -42, and beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) levels, and notably rescued the cognitive deficits in 12-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. These mouse data demonstrate that exposure to stress during the sensitive period early in life influences later amyloid pathology and cognition in genetically predisposed, mutant mice, and as such, may increase AD vulnerability. The fact that a short treatment with a GR antagonist at middle age lastingly reduced Abeta levels and rescued the cognitive deficits after ELS, highlights the therapeutic potential of this drug for reducing amyloid pathology.

29491481|t|The Spanish version of Face-Name Associative Memory Exam (S-FNAME) performance is related to amyloid burden in Subjective Cognitive Decline.
29491481|a|The Face-Name Associative Memory Exam (FNAME) is a paired associative memory test created to detect memory deficits in individuals with preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). Worse performance on FNAME in cognitively healthy individuals were found related to higher amyloid beta (Abeta) burden measured with Positron-Emission-Tomography using 11C-PiB (PiB-PET). We previously reported normative data of a Spanish version of FNAME (S-FNAME) in cognitively healthy Spanish-speaking subjects. The aim of the present study was to determine whether performance on S-FNAME was associated with Abeta burden in subjective cognitive decline (SCD) individuals. 200 SCD subjects received neurological and neuropsychological assessments, including the S-FNAME and the Word List task from the Wechsler-Memory-Scale-III (WMS-III). Moreover, they received an MRI and (18)F-Florbetaben Positron-Emission-Tomography (FBB-PET) to measure Abeta burden. Three cognitive factor composites were derived for the episodic memory measures (face-name [SFN-N], face-occupation [SFN-O] and WMS-III) to determine whether episodic memory performance was related to Abeta deposition. Higher global Abeta deposition was significantly related to worse performance on SFN-N but not with SFN-O or WMS-III Composite. Moreover, worse SFN-N performance was significantly related to higher Abeta deposition in bilateral  Posterior Cingulate Cortex. The S-FNAME may be a promising neuropsychological tool for detecting SCD individuals with preclinical AD.

29494806|t|Synaptic vesicle cycle and amyloid beta: Biting the hand that feeds.
29494806|a|The synaptic vesicle cycle (SVC) holds center stage in the biology of presynaptic terminals. Through recurrent exocytosis and endocytosis, it facilitates a sequence of events enabling chemical neurotransmission between functionally related neurons. As a fundamental process that links the interior of nerve cells with their environment, the SVC is also critical for signaling and provides an entry route for a range of pathogens and toxins, enabling detrimental effects. In Alzheimer's disease, the SVC is both the prime site of amyloid beta production and toxicity. In this study, we discuss the emerging evidence for physiological and pathological effects of Abeta on various stages of the SVC, from postfusion membrane recovery to trafficking, docking, and priming of vesicles for fusion and transmitter release. Understanding of the mechanisms of Abeta interaction with the SVC within the unifying calcium hypothesis of aging and Alzheimer's disease should further elucidate the fundamental biology of the presynaptic terminal and reveal novel therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's disease and other age-related dementias.

29495486|t|Aptamers Selected for Recognizing Amyloid beta-Protein-A Case for Cautious Optimism.
29495486|a|Aptamers are versatile oligonucleotide ligands used for molecular recognition of diverse targets. However, application of aptamers to the field of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) has been limited so far. Abeta is an intrinsically disordered protein that exists in a dynamic conformational equilibrium, presenting time-dependent ensembles of short-lived, metastable structures and assemblies that have been generally difficult to isolate and characterize. Moreover, despite understanding of potential physiological roles of Abeta, this peptide has been linked to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease, and its pathogenic roles remain controversial. Accumulated scientific evidence thus far highlights undesirable or nonspecific interactions between selected aptamers and different Abeta assemblies likely due to the metastable nature of Abeta or inherent affinity of RNA oligonucleotides to beta-sheet-rich fibrillar structures of amyloidogenic proteins. Accordingly, lessons drawn from Abeta-aptamer studies emphasize that purity and uniformity of the protein target and rigorous characterization of aptamers' specificity are important for realizing and garnering the full potential of aptamers selected for recognizing Abeta or other intrinsically disordered proteins. This review summarizes studies of aptamers selected for recognizing different Abeta assemblies and highlights controversies, difficulties, and limitations of such studies.

29497818|t|[18F] AV-1451 uptake in corticobasal syndrome: the influence of beta-amyloid and clinical presentation.
29497818|a|Corticobasal syndrome (CBS) is a phenotypic manifestation of diverse pathologies, including Alzheimer's disease and 4-repeat tauopathies. Predicting pathology in CBS is unreliable and, hence, molecular neuroimaging may prove to be useful. The aim of this study was to assess regional patterns of uptake on [18F] AV-1451 PET in CBS and determine whether patterns of uptake differ according to beta-amyloid deposition or differing clinical presentations. Fourteen patients meeting criteria for CBS underwent Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) and [18F] AV-1451 PET. Seven patients presented as CBS and seven presented with apraxia of speech (AOS) and later evolved into CBS. A global PiB summary was calculated and used to classify patients as PiB (-) or PiB (+). AV-1451 uptake was calculated in fourteen regions-of-interest, with values divided by uptake in cerebellar crus grey matter to generate standard uptake value ratios. AV-1451 uptake was considered elevated if it fell above the 95th percentile from a group of 476 cognitively unimpaired normal controls. Six of the 14 CBS patients (43%) were PiB (+), with three of these patients showing strikingly elevated AV-1451 uptake across many cortical regions. Of the eight PiB (-) patients, only those with AOS showed elevated AV-1451 uptake in supplementary motor area and precentral cortex compared to controls. No region of elevated AV-1451 uptake were observed in PiB (-) typical CBS patients without AOS. These results suggest that regional [18F] AV-1451 is variable in CBS and depends on the presence of beta-amyloid as well as clinical presentation such as AOS. PiB (+) CBS does not necessarily reflect underlying Alzheimer's disease; however, the possibility some of these patients will evolve into Alzheimer's disease over time cannot be excluded.

29499171|t|CSF biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease concord with amyloid-beta PET and predict clinical progression: A study of fully automated immunoassays in BioFINDER and ADNI cohorts.
29499171|a|INTRODUCTION: We studied whether fully automated Elecsys cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) immunoassay results were concordant with positron emission tomography (PET) and predicted clinical progression, even with cutoffs established in an independent cohort. METHODS: Cutoffs for Elecsys amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta), total tau/Abeta(1-42), and phosphorylated tau/Abeta(1-42) were defined against [18F]flutemetamol PET in Swedish BioFINDER (n = 277) and validated against [18F]florbetapir PET in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (n = 646). Clinical progression in patients with mild cognitive impairment (n = 619) was studied. RESULTS: CSF total tau/Abeta(1-42) and phosphorylated tau/Abeta(1-42) ratios were highly concordant with PET classification in BioFINDER (overall percent agreement: 90%; area under the curve: 94%). The CSF biomarker statuses established by predefined cutoffs were highly concordant with PET classification in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (overall percent agreement: 89%-90%; area under the curves: 96%) and predicted greater 2-year clinical decline in patients with mild cognitive impairment. Strikingly, tau/Abeta ratios were as accurate as semiquantitative PET image assessment in predicting visual read-based outcomes. DISCUSSION: Elecsys CSF biomarker assays may provide reliable alternatives to PET in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.

29500152|t|Cognitive and neuroimaging features and brain beta-amyloidosis in individuals at risk of Alzheimer's disease (INSIGHT-preAD): a longitudinal observational study.
29500152|a|BACKGROUND: Improved understanding is needed of risk factors and markers of disease progression in preclinical Alzheimer's disease. We assessed associations between brain beta-amyloidosis and various cognitive and neuroimaging parameters with progression of cognitive decline in individuals with preclinical Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: The INSIGHT-preAD is an ongoing single-centre observational study at the Salpetriere Hospital, Paris, France. Eligible participants were age 70-85 years with subjective memory complaints but unimpaired cognition and memory (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] score >=27, Clinical Dementia Rating score 0, and Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test [FCSRT] total recall score >=41). We stratified participants by brain amyloid beta deposition on 18F-florbetapir PET (positive or negative) at baseline. All patients underwent baseline assessments of demographic, cognitive, and psychobehavioural, characteristics, APOE epsilon4 allele carrier status, brain structure and function on MRI, brain glucose-metabolism on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET, and event-related potentials on electroencephalograms (EEGs). Actigraphy and CSF investigations were optional. Participants were followed up with clinical, cognitive, and psychobehavioural assessments every 6 months, neuropsychological assessments, EEG, and actigraphy every 12 months, and MRI, and 18F-FDG and 18F-florbetapir PET every 24 months. We assessed associations of amyloid beta deposition status with test outcomes at baseline and 24 months, and with clinical status at 30 months. Progression to prodromal Alzheimer's disease was defined as an amnestic syndrome of the hippocampal type. FINDINGS: From May 25, 2013, to Jan 20, 2015, we enrolled 318 participants with a mean age of 76 0 years (SD 3 5). The mean baseline MMSE score was 28 67 (SD 0 96), and the mean level of education was high (score >6 [SD 2] on a scale of 1-8, where 1=infant school and 8=higher education). 88 (28%) of 318 participants showed amyloid beta deposition and the remainder did not. The amyloid beta subgroups did not differ for any psychobehavioural, cognitive, actigraphy, and structural and functional neuroimaging results after adjustment for age, sex, and level of education More participants positive for amyloid beta deposition had the APOE epsilon4 allele (33 [38%] vs 29 [13%], p<0 0001). Amyloid beta1-42 concentration in CSF significantly correlated with mean 18F-florbetapir uptake at baseline (r=-0 62, p<0 0001) and the ratio of amyloid beta1-42 to amyloid beta1-40 (r=-0 61, p<0 0001), and identified amyloid beta deposition status with high accuracy (mean area under the curve values 0 89, 95% CI 0 80-0 98 and 0 84, 0 72-0 96, respectively). No difference was seen in MMSE (28 3 [SD 2 0] vs 28 9 [1 2], p=0 16) and Clinical Dementia Rating scores (0 06 [0 2] vs 0 05 [0 3]; p=0 79) at 30 months (n=274) between participants positive or negative for amyloid beta. Four participants (all positive for amyloid beta deposition at baseline) progressed to prodromal Alzheimer's disease. They were older than other participants positive for amyloid beta deposition at baseline (mean 80 2 years [SD 4 1] vs 76 8 years [SD 3 4]) and had greater 18F-florbetapir uptake at baseline (mean standard uptake value ratio 1 46 [SD 0 16] vs 1 02 [SD 0 20]), and more were carriers of the APOE epsilon4 allele (three [75%] of four vs 33 [39%] of 83). They also had mild executive dysfunction at baseline (mean FCSRT free recall score 21 25 [SD 2 75] vs 29 08 [5 44] and Frontal Assessment Battery total score 13 25 [1 50] vs 16 05 [1 68]). INTERPRETATION: Brain beta-amyloidosis alone did not predict progression to prodromal Alzheimer's disease within 30 months. Longer follow-up is needed to establish whether this finding remains consistent.

29501155|t|A new electrochemical immunoassay for prion protein based on hybridization chain reaction with hemin/G-quadruplex DNAzyme.
29501155|a|In this work, a new electrochemical immunosensor was developed for prion protein assay based on hybridization chain reaction (HCR) with hemin/G-quadruplex DNAzyme for signal amplification. In this amplification system, the hemin/G-quadruplex DNAzyme simultaneously mimicked the biocatalytic functions for H2O2 reduction and L-cysteine oxidation. In the presence of L-cysteine, the hemin/G-quadruplex catalyzed the oxidation of L-cysteine to L-cystine. At the same time, H2O2 was produced under the oxygen condition. Then, the hemin/G-quadruplex could quickly catalyze the reduction of H2O2, mimicking the catalytic performance of horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Under the optimal conditions, the immunosensor showed a wide linear response range from 0.5 pg/mL to 100 ng/mL with the low detection limit of 0.38 pg/mL (3sigma). By changing the specific antibody, this strategy could be easily extended to detect the infectious isoform of prion (PrPSc) and other proteins. Based on its good analytical performance, the developed method shows great potential applications in diagnosis of prion diseases at presymptomatic stage and bioanalysis.

29501462|t|Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers measured by Elecsys assays compared to amyloid imaging.
29501462|a|INTRODUCTION: Levels of amyloid beta peptide 42 (Abeta42), total tau, and phosphorylated tau-181 are well-established cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease, but variability in manual plate-based assays has limited their use. We examined the relationship between CSF biomarkers, as measured by a novel automated immunoassay platform, and amyloid positron emission tomography. METHODS: CSF samples from 200 individuals underwent separate analysis for Abeta42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau-181 with automated Roche Elecsys assays. Abeta40 was measured with a commercial plate-based assay. Positron emission tomography with Pittsburgh Compound B was performed less than 1 year from CSF collection. RESULTS: Ratios of CSF biomarkers (total tau/Abeta42, phosphorylated tau-181/Abeta42, and Abeta42/Abeta40) best discriminated Pittsburgh Compound B-positive from Pittsburgh Compound B-negative individuals. DISCUSSION: CSF biomarkers and amyloid positron emission tomography reflect different aspects of Alzheimer's disease brain pathology, and therefore, less-than-perfect correspondence is expected. Automated assays are likely to increase the utility of CSF biomarkers.

29501676|t|Validation of ethnopharmacology of ayurvedic sarasvata ghrita and comparative evaluation of its neuroprotective effect with modern alcoholic and lipid based extracts in beta-amyloid induced memory impairment.
29501676|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Sarasvata ghrita (SG), a polyherbal formulation from ayurveda, an ancient medicinal system of India, has been used to improve intelligence and memory, treat speech delay, speaking difficulties and low digestion power in children. AIM OF THE STUDY: Study aimed to validate the ethno use of SG in memory enhancement through systematic scientific protocol. The effect of SG and modern extracts of ingredients of SG was compared on cognitive function and neuroprotection in amyloid-beta peptide 25-35(Abeta25-35) induced memory impairment in wistar rats. Further the underlying mechanism for neuroprotective activity was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SG was prepared as per traditional method, ethanolic extract (EE) was prepared by conventional method and lipid based extract was prepared by modern extraction method. All extracts were standardised by newly developed HPLC method with respect to marker compounds. SG, EE and LE were administered orally to male Wistar rats at doses of 100,200 and 400 mg/kg Body Weight by feeding needle for a period of 21 days after the intracerebroventricular administration of Abeta25-35 bilaterally. Spatial memory of rats was tested using Morris water maze (MWM) and Radial arm maze (RAM) test. The possible underlying mechanisms for the cognitive improvement exhibited by SG, EE and LE was investigated through ex-vivo brain antioxidant effect, monoamine level estimation, acetylcholine esterase (AchE) inhibitory effect and Brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) levels estimation. RESULTS: SG, EE and LE were analyzed by HPLC method, results showed that EE extract has high percent of selected phytoconstituents as compared with SG and LE. SG and LE decrease escape latency and searching distance in a dose dependant manner during MWM test. In case of RAM significant decrease in number of errors and increase in number of correct choices indicate an elevation in retention and recall aspects of learning and memory after administration of SG an LE. SG and LE extract can efficiently prevent accumulation of beta-amyloid plaque in hippocampus region. There was increase in SOD, GSH, CAT and NO level and decrease in MDA levels in SG and LE administered animals. SG and LE have found to exhibit AchE inhibitiory activity and significant dose-dependant increase in BDNF level in the plasma. SG and LE significantly increased the levels of noradrenaline, dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine in the brain. CONCLUSION: The study validated the neuroprotective activity of SG. The study concludes the extraction efficiency of SG for selected phytoconstituents is less than modern methods. However the neuroprotective activity of SG and LE was found to be greater than EE.

29504531|t|Induction of Amyloid-beta42 Production by Fipronil and Other Pyrazole Insecticides.
29504531|a|Generation of amyloid-beta peptides (Abetas) by proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP), especially increased production of Abeta42/Abeta43 over Abeta40, and their aggregation as oligomers and plaques, represent a characteristic feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In familial AD (FAD), altered Abeta production originates from specific mutations of AbetaPP or presenilins 1/2 (PS1/PS2), the catalytic subunits of gamma-secretase. In sporadic AD, the origin of altered production of Abetas remains unknown. We hypothesize that the 'human chemical exposome' contains products able to favor the production of Abeta42/Abeta43 over Abeta40 and shorter Abetas. To detect such products, we screened a library of 3500 + compounds in a cell-based assay for enhanced Abeta42/Abeta43 production. Nine pyrazole insecticides were found to induce a beta- and gamma-secretase-dependent, 3-10-fold increase in the production of extracellular Abeta42 in various cell lines and neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells derived from healthy and FAD patients. Immunoprecipitation/mass spectrometry analyses showed increased production of Abetas cleaved at positions 42/43, and reduced production of peptides cleaved at positions 38 and shorter. Strongly supporting a direct effect on gamma-secretase activity, pyrazoles shifted the cleavage pattern of another gamma-secretase substrate, alcadeinalpha, and shifted the cleavage of AbetaPP by highly purified gamma-secretase toward Abeta42/Abeta43. Focusing on fipronil, we showed that some of its metabolites, in particular the persistent fipronil sulfone, also favor the production of Abeta42/Abeta43 in both cell-based and cell-free systems. Fipronil administered orally to mice and rats is known to be metabolized rapidly, mostly to fipronil sulfone, which stably accumulates in adipose tissue and brain. In conclusion, several widely used pyrazole insecticides enhance the production of toxic, aggregation prone Abeta42/Abeta43 peptides, suggesting the possible existence of environmental "Alzheimerogens" which may contribute to the initiation and propagation of the amyloidogenic process in sporadic AD.

29505099|t|Higher levels of kallikrein-8 in female brain may increase the risk for Alzheimer's disease.
29505099|a|Women seem to have a higher vulnerability to Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying mechanisms of this sex dichotomy are not well understood. Here, we first determined the influence of sex on various aspects of Alzheimer's pathology in transgenic CRND8 mice. We demonstrate that beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaque burden starts to be more severe around P180 (moderate disease stage) in female transgenics when compared to males and that aging aggravates this sex-specific difference. Furthermore, we show that female transgenics suffer from higher levels of neurovascular dysfunction around P180, resulting in impaired Abeta peptide clearance across the blood-brain-barrier at P360. Female transgenics show also higher levels of diffuse microgliosis and inflammation, but the density of microglial cells surrounding Abeta plaques is less in females. In line with this finding, testosterone compared to estradiol was able to improve microglial viability and Abeta clearance in vitro. The spatial memory of transgenics was in general poorer than in wildtypes and at P360 worse in females irrespective of their genotype. This difference was accompanied by a slightly diminished dendritic complexity in females. While all the above-named sex-differences emerged after the onset of Abeta pathology, kallikrein-8 (KLK8) protease levels were, as an exception, higher in female than in male brains very early when virtually no plaques were detectable. In a second step, we quantified cerebral KLK8 levels in AD patients and healthy controls, and could ascertain, similar to mice, higher KLK8 levels not only in AD-affected but also in healthy brains of women. Accordingly, we could demonstrate that estradiol but not testosterone induces KLK8 synthesis in neuronal and microglial cells. In conclusion, multiple features of AD are more pronounced in females. Here, we show for the first time that this sex-specific difference may be meditated by estrogen-induced KLK8 overproduction long before AD pathology emerges.

In developed countries the highest incidence of epilepsy is already in people over 65 and, as life expectancy increases, individuals who developed epilepsy at a young age are also living longer. Recent findings show that older persons with epilepsy are more likely to suffer from cognitive dysfunction and that there might be an important bidirectional relationship between epilepsy and dementia. Thus some people with epilepsy may be at a higher risk of developing dementia, while individuals with some forms of dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, are at significantly higher risk of developing epilepsy. Consistent with this emerging view, epidemiological findings reveal that people with epilepsy and individuals with Alzheimer's disease share common risk factors. Recent studies in Alzheimer's disease and late-onset epilepsy also suggest common pathological links mediated by underlying vascular changes and/or tau pathology. Meanwhile electrophysiological and neuroimaging investigations in epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia have focused interest on network level dysfunction, which might be important in mediating cognitive dysfunction across all three of these conditions. In this review we consider whether seizures promote dementia, whether dementia causes seizures, or if common underlying pathophysiological mechanisms cause both. We examine the evidence that cognitive impairment is associated with epilepsy in older people (aged over 65) and the prognosis for patients with epilepsy developing dementia, with a specific emphasis on common mechanisms that might underlie the cognitive deficits observed in epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease. Our analyses suggest that there is considerable intersection between epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease and cerebrovascular disease raising the possibility that better understanding of shared mechanisms in these conditions might help to ameliorate not just seizures, but also epileptogenesis and cognitive dysfunction.

29508987|t|Elucidating the Structures of Amyloid Oligomers with Macrocyclic beta-Hairpin Peptides: Insights into Alzheimer's Disease and Other Amyloid Diseases.
29508987|a|In the more than a century since its identification, Alzheimer's disease has become the archetype of amyloid diseases. The first glimpses of the chemical basis of Alzheimer's disease began with the identification of "amyloid" plaques in the brain in 1892 and extended to the identification of proteinaceous fibrils with "cross-beta" structure in 1968. Further efforts led to the discovery of the beta-amyloid peptide, Abeta, as a 40- or 42-amino acid peptide that is responsible for the plaques and fibrils. At this point, a three-decade-long marathon began to elucidate the structure of the fibrils and identify the molecular basis of Alzheimer's disease. Along the way, an alternative model began to emerge in which small aggregates of Abeta, called "oligomers", rather than fibrils, are the culprits that lead to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. This Account describes what is known about the structures of the fibrils and details our research group's efforts to understand the structural, biophysical, and biological properties of the oligomers in amyloid diseases. beta-Sheets are the building blocks of amyloid fibrils and oligomers. Amyloid fibrils generally consist of extended networks of parallel beta-sheets. Amyloid oligomers appear to be more compact enclosed structures, some of which are thought to be composed of antiparallel beta-sheets comprising beta-hairpins. beta-Hairpins are special because their twisted shape, hydrophobic surfaces, and exposed hydrogen-bonding edges impart a unique propensity to form compact assemblies. Our laboratory has developed macrocyclic beta-sheets that are designed to mimic beta-hairpins formed by amyloidogenic peptides and proteins. The beta-hairpin mimics contain two beta-strand peptide fragments linked together at their N- and C-termini by two delta-linked ornithine turn mimics to create a macrocycle. An N-methyl group is installed on one of the beta-strands to prevent uncontrolled aggregation. These design features facilitate crystallization of the beta-hairpin mimics and determination of the X-ray crystallographic structures of the oligomers that they form. During the past few years, our laboratory has elucidated the X-ray crystallographic structures of oligomers formed by beta-hairpin mimics derived from Abeta, alpha-synuclein, and beta2-microglobulin. Out of these three amyloidogenic peptides and proteins, the Abeta beta-hairpin mimics have provided the most insight into amyloid oligomers. Our studies have revealed a previously undiscovered mode of self-assembly, whereby three Abeta beta-hairpin mimics assemble to form a triangular trimer. The triangular trimers are remarkable, because they contain two largely hydrophobic surfaces that pack together with other triangular trimers to form higher-order oligomers, such as hexamers and dodecamers. Some of the dodecamers pack in the crystal lattice to form annular porelike assemblies. Some of the beta-hairpin mimics and triangular trimers assemble in solution to form oligomers that recapitulate the crystallographically observed oligomers. These oligomers exhibit toxicity toward neuronally derived cells, recapitulating the toxicity of the oligomers formed by full-length amyloidogenic peptides and proteins. These findings are significant, because they address a gap in understanding the molecular basis of amyloid diseases. We anticipate that these studies will pave the way for developing diagnostics and therapeutics to combat Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and other amyloid diseases.

29510187|t|Rhynchophylline suppresses soluble Abeta1-42-induced impairment of spatial cognition function via inhibiting excessive activation of extrasynaptic NR2B-containing NMDA receptors.
29510187|a|Rhynchophylline (RIN) is a significant active component isolated from the Chinese herbal medicine Uncaria rhynchophylla. The overproduction of soluble amyloid beta protein (Abeta) oligomers in the hippocampus is closely involved in impairments in cognitive function at the early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Growing evidences show that RIN possesses neuroprotective effects against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. However, whether RIN can prevent soluble Abeta1-42-induced impairments in spatial cognitive function and synaptic plasticity is still unclear. Using the combined methods of behavioral tests, immunofluorescence and electrophysiological recordings, we characterized the key neuroprotective properties of RIN and its possible cellular and molecular mechanisms against soluble Abeta1-42-related impairments in rats. Our findings are as follows: (1) RIN efficiently rescued the soluble Abeta1-42-induced spatial learning and memory deficits in the Morris water maze test and prevented soluble Abeta1-42-induced suppression in long term potentiation (LTP) in the entorhinal cortex (EC)-dentate gyrus (DG) circuit. (2) Excessive activation of extrasynaptic GluN2B-NMDAR and subsequent Ca2+ overload contributed to the soluble Abeta1-42-induced impairments in spatial cognitive function and synaptic plasticity. (3) RIN prevented Abeta1-42-induced excessive activation of extrasynaptic NMDARs by reducing extrasynaptic NMDARs -mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents and down regulating GluN2B-NMDAR expression in the DG region, which inhibited Abeta1-42-induced Ca2+ overload mediated by extrasynanptic NMDARs. The results suggest that RIN could be an effective therapeutic candidate for cognitive impairment in AD.

29518051|t|Multi-Target Anti-Alzheimer Activities of Four Prenylated Compounds from Psoralea Fructus.
29518051|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease that is mediated by multiple signaling pathways. In recent years, the components of Psoralea Fructus (PF) have demonstrated some anti-Alzheimer effects both in vitro and in vivo. To further reveal the active compounds of PF and their mechanisms regulating key targets of AD, in this study, we identified four prenylated compounds from the 70% ethanolic aqueous extract of PF, namely bavachin, bavachinin, bavachalcone, and isobavachalcone. Multi-target bioactivity analysis showed that these compounds could differentially inhibit neuroinflammation, oxidative damage, and key AD-related protein targets, such as amyloid beta-peptide 42, beta-secretase, glycogen synthase kinase 3beta, and acetylcholinesterase. These compounds may generate beneficial effects in AD prevention and treatment.

29518357|t|Elevated TREM2 Gene Dosage Reprograms Microglia Responsivity and Ameliorates Pathological Phenotypes in Alzheimer's Disease Models.
29518357|a|Variants of TREM2 are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). To study whether increasing TREM2 gene dosage could modify the disease pathogenesis, we developed BAC transgenic mice expressing human TREM2 (BAC-TREM2) in microglia. We found that elevated TREM2 expression reduced amyloid burden in the 5xFAD mouse model. Transcriptomic profiling demonstrated that increasing TREM2 levels conferred a rescuing effect, which includes dampening the expression of multiple disease-associated microglial genes and augmenting downregulated neuronal genes. Interestingly, 5xFAD/BAC-TREM2 mice showed further upregulation of several reactive microglial genes linked to phagocytosis and negative regulation of immune cell activation. Moreover, these mice showed enhanced process ramification and phagocytic marker expression in plaque-associated microglia and reduced neuritic dystrophy. Finally, elevated TREM2 gene dosage led to improved memory performance in AD models. In summary, our study shows that a genomic transgene-driven increase in TREM2 expression reprograms microglia responsivity and ameliorates neuropathological and behavioral deficits in AD mouse models.

29522171|t|Preferential degradation of cognitive networks differentiates Alzheimer's disease from ageing.
29522171|a|Converging evidence from structural, metabolic and functional connectivity MRI suggests that neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, target specific neural networks. However, age-related network changes commonly co-occur with neuropathological cascades, limiting efforts to disentangle disease-specific alterations in network function from those associated with normal ageing. Here we elucidate the differential effects of ageing and Alzheimer's disease pathology through simultaneous analyses of two functional connectivity MRI datasets: (i) young participants harbouring highly-penetrant mutations leading to autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network (DIAN), an Alzheimer's disease cohort in which age-related comorbidities are minimal and likelihood of progression along an Alzheimer's disease trajectory is extremely high; and (ii) young and elderly participants from the Harvard Aging Brain Study, a cohort in which imaging biomarkers of amyloid burden and neurodegeneration can be used to disambiguate ageing alone from preclinical Alzheimer's disease. Consonant with prior reports, we observed the preferential degradation of cognitive (especially the default and dorsal attention networks) over motor and sensory networks in early autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease, and found that this distinctive degradation pattern was magnified in more advanced stages of disease. Importantly, a nascent form of the pattern observed across the autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease spectrum was also detectable in clinically normal elderly with clear biomarker evidence of Alzheimer's disease pathology (preclinical Alzheimer's disease). At the more granular level of individual connections between node pairs, we observed that connections within cognitive networks were preferentially targeted in Alzheimer's disease (with between network connections relatively spared), and that connections between positively coupled nodes (correlations) were preferentially degraded as compared to connections between negatively coupled nodes (anti-correlations). In contrast, ageing in the absence of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers was characterized by a far less network-specific degradation across cognitive and sensory networks, of between- and within-network connections, and of connections between positively and negatively coupled nodes. We go on to demonstrate that formalizing the differential patterns of network degradation in ageing and Alzheimer's disease may have the practical benefit of yielding connectivity measurements that highlight early Alzheimer's disease-related connectivity changes over those due to age-related processes. Together, the contrasting patterns of connectivity in Alzheimer's disease and ageing add to prior work arguing against Alzheimer's disease as a form of accelerated ageing, and suggest multi-network composite functional connectivity MRI metrics may be useful in the detection of early Alzheimer's disease-specific alterations co-occurring with age-related connectivity changes. More broadly, our findings are consistent with a specific pattern of network degradation associated with the spreading of Alzheimer's disease pathology within targeted neural networks.

29522854|t|Chronic Amyloid beta Oligomer Infusion Evokes Sustained Inflammation and Microglial Changes in the Rat Hippocampus via NLRP3.
29522854|a|Microglia are instrumental for recognition and elimination of amyloid beta1-42 oligomers (AbetaOs), but the long-term consequences of AbetaO-induced inflammatory changes in the brain are unclear. Here, we explored microglial responses and transciptome-level inflammatory signatures in the rat hippocampus after chronic AbetaO challenge. Middle-aged Long Evans rats received intracerebroventricular infusion of AbetaO or vehicle for 4 weeks, followed by treatment with artificial CSF or MCC950 for the subsequent 4 weeks. AbetaO infusion evoked a sustained inflammatory response including activation of NF-kappaB, triggered microglia activation and increased the expression of pattern recognition and phagocytic receptors. Abeta1-42 plaques were not detectable likely due to microglial elimination of infused oligomers. In addition, we found upregulation of neuronal inhibitory ligands and their cognate microglial receptors, while downregulation of Esr1 and Scn1a, encoding estrogen receptor alpha and voltage-gated sodium-channel Na(v)1.1, respectively, was observed. These changes were associated with impaired hippocampus-dependent spatial memory and resembled early neurological changes seen in Alzheimer's disease. To investigate the role of inflammatory actions in memory deterioration, we performed MCC950 infusion, which specifically blocks the NLRP3 inflammasome. MCC950 attenuated AbetaO-evoked microglia reactivity, restored expression of neuronal inhibitory ligands, reversed downregulation of ERalpha, and abolished memory impairments. Furthermore, MCC950 abrogated AbetaO-invoked reduction of serum IL-10. These findings provide evidence that in response to AbetaO infusion microglia change their phenotype, but the resulting inflammatory changes are sustained for at least one month after the end of AbetaO challenge. Lasting NLRP3-driven inflammatory alterations and altered hippocampal gene expression contribute to spatial memory decline.

29523644|t|Age-accelerated cognitive decline in asymptomatic adults with CSF beta-amyloid.
29523644|a|OBJECTIVE: Compare cognitive and hippocampal volume trajectories in asymptomatic middle-aged and older adults with positive CSF markers of beta-amyloid (Abeta) or tau to adults without an Alzheimer disease (AD)-associated biomarker profile. METHODS: Three hundred ninety-two adults enrolled in a longitudinal cohort study (Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention or Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center) completed a lumbar puncture and at least 2 biennial or annual neuropsychological evaluations. Cutoffs for Abeta42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau were developed via receiver operating characteristic curve analyses on a sample of 78 participants (38 dementia, 40 controls). These cutoffs were applied to a separate sample of 314 cognitively healthy adults (mean age at CSF collection = 61.5 years), and mixed-effects regression analyses tested linear and quadratic interactions of biomarker group x age at each visit on cognitive and hippocampal volume outcomes. RESULTS: Two hundred fifteen participants (69%) were biomarker negative (preclinical AD stage 0), 46 (15%) were Abeta+ only (preclinical AD stage 1), 25 (8%) were Abeta+ and tau+ (preclinical AD stage 2), and 28 (9%) were tau+ only. Both stage 1 and stage 2 groups exhibited greater rates of linear decline on story memory and processing speed measures, and nonlinear decline on list-learning and set-shifting measures compared to stage 0. The tau+ only group did not significantly differ from stage 0 in rates of cognitive decline. CONCLUSION: In an asymptomatic at-risk cohort, elevated CSF Abeta (with or without elevated tau) was associated with greater rates of cognitive decline, with the specific pattern of decline varying across cognitive measures.

29525434|t|Metallomics for Alzheimer's disease treatment: Use of new generation of chelators combining metal-cation binding and transport properties.
29525434|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting tens of million people. Currently marketed drugs have limited therapeutic efficacy and only slowing down the neurodegenerative process. Interestingly, it has been suggested that biometal cations in the amyloid beta (Abeta) aggregate deposits contribute to neurotoxicity and degenerative changes in AD. Thus, chelation therapy could represent novel mode of therapeutic intervention. Here we describe the features of chelators with therapeutically relevant mechanism of action. We have found that the tested compounds effectively reduce the toxicity of exogenous Abeta and suppress its endogenous production as well as decrease oxidative stress. Cholyl hydrazones were found to be the most active compounds. In summary, our data show that cation complexation, together with improving transport efficacy may represent basis for eventual treatment strategy in AD.

29526708|t|Aggregation kinetics in the presence of brain lipids of Abeta(1-40) cleaved from a soluble fusion protein.
29526708|a|The cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein by beta- and gamma-secretases is a key event in Alzheimer's disease. A fusion protein was constructed to investigate the cleavage rate and aggregation kinetics of amyloid-beta (1-40) (Abeta(1-40)) peptides. The peptide was expressed with a Small Ubiquitin-Like Modifier (SUMO) on the N-terminus and cleaved by a SUMO protease Ulp1. The time course of the cleavage reaction was monitored by SDS-PAGE gel with 100:1 or 1000:1 SUMO-Abeta(1-40) to Ulp1 molar ratio and in the presence of brain total lipid extract unilamellar vesicles. Similarly, the aggregation of Abeta(1-40) peptides upon cleavage was monitored by thioflavin T fluorescence assays and by circular dichroism. The cleavage reaction was modulated by the concentration of Ulp1, with fast release of Abeta(1-40) peptides producing shorter lag time before fibril formation, but with similar elongation rate. The presence of lipids significantly reduced the cleavage completion at 1000:1, but reduced the lag time before fibril formation, while at 100:1 similar cleavage and aggregation kinetics were observed compared to the lipid-free condition. Overall, the results showed that the fusion protein SUMO-Abeta(1-40) is a means to study the cleavage and aggregation of amyloid peptides and that the presence of lipids and the fast release rate accelerated the aggregation of Abeta(1-40) peptides.

29527600|t|Microfluidic approaches for probing amyloid assembly and behaviour.
29527600|a|The self-assembly of proteins into supramolecular structures and machinery underpins biological activity in living systems. Misassembled, misfolded and aggregated protein structures can, by contrast, have deleterious activity and such species are at the origin of a number of disease states ranging from cancer to neurodegenerative disorders. In particular, the formation of highly ordered protein aggregates, amyloid fibrils, from normally soluble peptides and proteins, is the common pathological hallmark of a range a group of over fifty protein misfolding disorders. Because of the critical role of the process in the aetiology of such disorders, as well as the quest to understand the basic principles of protein folding and misfolding, the amyloid phenomenon has become a central area of modern biomedical research. Advances in our knowledge of the physical properties of amyloid systems have, however, also highlighted the potential of amyloid structures in the context of materials science. In this review, we explore how microfluidic approaches can be used to study aspects of amyloid assembly and behaviour that are challenging to probe under bulk solution conditions. We discuss the use of volume confinement to probe very early events in the amyloid formation process. In addition, the well-defined fluid flow properties within channels with dimensions on the micron scale can be exploited to measure the physical properties of protein aggregates, such as their sizes and charges, to shed light on the physical and chemical parameters defining amyloid species. Moreover, the molecular species formed during aggregation reactions have physical dimensions spanning at least three orders of magnitude, and microfluidic techniques are well suited to work with analytes of such disparate dimensions. Furthermore, the flexibility of the design of microfluidic devices lends itself to adaptable experimental setups, including the study of protein self-assembly within living cells. Finally, we highlight the salient features of microfluidic experiments that facilitate probing complex biological systems, and discuss their use in the exploration of amyloids as a class of functional material.

29530050|t|Sulforaphane rescues amyloid-beta peptide-mediated decrease in MerTK expression through its anti-inflammatory effect in human THP-1 macrophages.
29530050|a|BACKGROUND: Mer tyrosine kinase (MerTK) activity necessary for amyloid-stimulated phagocytosis strongly implicates that MerTK dysregulation might contribute to chronic inflammation implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. However, the precise mechanism involved in the regulation of MerTK expression by amyloid-beta (Abeta) in proinflammatory environment has not yet been ascertained. METHODS: The objective of this study was to determine the underlying mechanism involved in Abeta-mediated decrease in MerTK expression through Abeta-mediated regulation of MerTK expression and its modulation by sulforaphane in human THP-1 macrophages challenged with Abeta1-42. We used protein preparation, Ca2+ influx fluorescence imaging, nuclear fractionation, Western blotting techniques, and small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown to perform our study. RESULTS: Abeta1-42 elicited a marked decrease in MerTK expression along with increased intracellular Ca2+ level and induction of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta and TNF-alpha. Ionomycin A and thapsigargin also increased intracellular Ca2+ levels and production of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, mimicking the effect of Abeta1-42. In contrast, the Abeta1-42-evoked responses were attenuated by depletion of Ca2+ with ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid. Furthermore, recombinant IL-1beta or TNF-alpha elicited a decrease in MerTK expression. However, immunodepletion of IL-1beta or TNF-alpha with neutralizing antibodies significantly inhibited Abeta1-42-mediated downregulation of MerTK expression. Notably, sulforaphane treatment potently inhibited Abeta1-42-induced intracellular Ca2+ level and rescued the decrease in MerTK expression by blocking nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) nuclear translocation, thereby decreasing IL-1beta and TNF-alpha production upon Abeta1-42 stimulation. Such adverse effects of sulforaphane were replicated by BAY 11-7082, a NF-kappaB inhibitor. Moreover, sulforaphane's anti-inflammatory effects on Abeta1-42-induced production of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha were significantly diminished by siRNA-mediated knockdown of MerTK, confirming a critical role of MerTK in suppressing Abeta1-42-induced innate immune response. CONCLUSION: These findings implicate that targeting of MerTK with phytochemical sulforaphane as a mechanism for preventing Abeta1-42-induced neuroinflammation has potential to be applied in AD therapeutics.

29530923|t|Endosomal-Lysosomal Cholesterol Sequestration by U18666A Differentially Regulates Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) Metabolism in Normal and APP-Overexpressing Cells.
29530923|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide, derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP), plays a critical role in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Current evidence indicates that altered levels or subcellular distribution of cholesterol can regulate Abeta production and clearance, but it remains unclear how cholesterol sequestration within the endosomal-lysosomal (EL) system can influence APP metabolism. Thus, we evaluated the effects of U18666A, which triggers cholesterol redistribution within the EL system, on mouse N2a cells expressing different levels of APP in the presence or absence of extracellular cholesterol and lipids provided by fetal bovine serum (FBS). Our results reveal that U18666A and FBS differentially increase the levels of APP and its cleaved products, the alpha-, beta-, and eta-C-terminal fragments, in N2a cells expressing normal levels of mouse APP (N2awt), higher levels of human wild-type APP (APPwt), or "Swedish" mutant APP (APPsw). The cellular levels of Abeta1-40/Abeta1-42 were markedly increased in U18666A-treated APPwt and APPsw cells. Our studies further demonstrate that APP and its cleaved products are partly accumulated in the lysosomes, possibly due to decreased clearance. Finally, we show that autophagy inhibition plays a role in mediating U18666A effects. Collectively, these results suggest that altered levels and distribution of cholesterol and lipids can differentially regulate APP metabolism depending on the nature of APP expression.

Objective: To investigate whether EDS at baseline is associated with a longitudinal increase in regional beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation in a cohort of elderly individuals without dementia. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective analysis included participants enrolled in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, a longitudinal population-based study in Olmsted County, Minnesota. Of 2900 participants, 2172 (74.9%) agreed to undergo carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography (PiB-PET). We included 283 participants 70 years or older without dementia who completed surveys assessing sleepiness at baseline and had at least 2 consecutive PiB-PET scans from January 1, 2009, through July 31, 2016, after excluding 45 (13.7%) who had a comorbid neurologic disorder. Main Outcomes and Measures: Excessive daytime sleepiness was defined as an Epworth Sleepiness Scale score of at least 10. The difference in Abeta levels between the 2 consecutive scans (DeltaPiB) in Abeta-susceptible regions (prefrontal, anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate-precuneus, and parietal) was determined. Multiple linear regression models were fit to explore associations between baseline EDS and DeltaPiB while adjusting for baseline age, sex, presence of the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele, educational level, baseline PiB uptake, global PiB positivity (standardized uptake value ratio >=1.4), physical activity, cardiovascular comorbidities (obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes), reduced sleep duration, respiratory symptoms during sleep, depression, and interval between scans. Results: Of the initial 283 participants, mean (SD) age was 77.1 (4.8) years; 204 (72.1%) were men and 79 (27.9%) were women. Sixty-three participants (22.3%) had EDS. Baseline EDS was significantly associated with increased regional Abeta accumulation in the anterior cingulate (B coefficient = 0.031; 95% CI, 0.001-0.061; P = .04), posterior cingulate-precuneus (B coefficient = 0.038; 95% CI, 0.006-0.069; P = .02), and parietal (B coefficient = 0.033; 95% CI, 0.001-0.065; P = .04) regions. Association of EDS with longitudinal Abeta accumulation was stronger in participants with baseline global PiB positivity in the anterior cingulate (B coefficient = 0.065; 95% CI, 0.010-0.118; P = .02) and cingulate-precuneus (B coefficient = 0.068; 95% CI, 0.009-0.126; P = .02) regions. Conclusions and Relevance: Baseline EDS was associated with increased longitudinal Abeta accumulation in elderly persons without dementia, suggesting that those with EDS may be more vulnerable to pathologic changes associated with Alzheimer disease. Further work is needed to elucidate whether EDS is a clinical marker of greater sleep instability, synaptic or network overload, or neurodegeneration of wakefulness-promoting centers. Early identification of patients with EDS and treatment of underlying sleep disorders could reduce Abeta accumulation in this vulnerable group.

29537826|t|Direct Evidence of the Presence of Cross-Linked Abeta Dimers in the Brains of Alzheimer's Disease Patients.
29537826|a|Brain-derived amyloid-beta (Abeta) dimers are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, their covalent nature remains controversial. This feature is relevant, as a covalent cross-link has been proposed to make brain-derived dimers (brain dimers) more synaptotoxic than Abeta monomers and would also make them suitable candidates for biomarker development. To resolve this controversy, we here present a three-step approach. First, we validated a type of synthetic cross-linked Abeta (CL Abeta) dimers, obtained by means of the photoinduced cross-linking of unmodified proteins (PICUP) reaction, as well-defined mimics of putative brain CL Abeta dimers. Second, we used these PICUP CL Abeta dimers as standards to improve the isolation of brain Abeta dimers and to develop state-of-the-art mass spectrometry (MS) strategies to allow their characterization. Third, we applied these MS methods to the analysis of brain Abeta dimer samples allowing the detection of the CL [Abeta(6-16)]2 peptide comprising a dityrosine cross-link. This result demonstrates the presence of CL Abeta dimers in the brains of patients with AD and opens up avenues for establishing new therapeutic targets and developing novel biomarkers for this disease.

29538658|t|FDG-PET in tau-negative amnestic dementia resembles that of autopsy-proven hippocampal sclerosis.
29538658|a|See Gordon (doi:10.1093/brain/awy052) for a scientific commentary on this article.Predicting underlying pathology based on clinical presentation has historically proven difficult, especially in older cohorts. Age-related hippocampal sclerosis may account for a significant proportion of elderly participants with amnestic dementia. Advances in molecular neuroimaging have allowed for detailed biomarker-based phenotyping, but in the absence of antemortem markers of hippocampal sclerosis, cases of mixed pathology remain problematic. We evaluated the utility of 18F-FDG-PET to differentiate flortaucipir tau PET negative from flortaucipir positive amnestic mild cognitive impairment and dementia and used an autopsy confirmed cohort to test the hypothesis that hippocampal sclerosis might account for the observed pattern. We identified impaired participants (Clinical Dementia Rating > 0) with amnestic presentations >= 75 years who had MRI and PET imaging with 18F-FDG (glucose metabolism), Pittsburgh compound B (amyloid) and flortaucipir (tau) performed within a year of cognitive assessment. These were stratified into amyloid positive/negative and tau positive/negative according to the A/T/N classification scheme. Our sample included 15 amyloid and tau-positive participants, and nine tau-negative participants (five of whom were amyloid-positive). For the autopsy cohort, sequential cases with antemortem 18F-FDG-PET were screened and those with TDP-43-negative Alzheimer's disease (10 cases) and TDP-43-positive hippocampal sclerosis (eight cases) were included. We compared each group to controls and to each other in a voxel-based analysis, and supplemented this with a region of interest-based analysis comparing medial to inferior temporal metabolism. Tau-positive and negative cases did not differ on neuropsychological testing or structural magnetic resonance biomarkers. Tau-negative cases had focal medial temporal and posterior cingulate/retrosplenial hypometabolism regardless of amyloid status, whereas tau-positive cases had additional lateral parietal and inferior temporal involvement. The inferior/medial temporal metabolism ratio was significantly different between the groups with the tau-negative group having a higher ratio. In the autopsy series, hippocampal sclerosis cases had greater medial temporal hypometabolism than Alzheimer's disease cases, who had more parietal and lateral/inferior temporal hypometabolism. Again, the ratio between temporal regions of interest differed significantly between groups. Two of the tau-negative patients, both of whom had an elevated inferior/medial temporal ratio, came to autopsy during the study and were found to have hippocampal sclerosis. Our finding that tau-negative amnestic mild cognitive impairment and dementia is associated with focal medial temporal and posterior cingulate hypometabolism extends prior reports in amyloid-negative cases. The inferior/medial temporal metabolism ratio can help identify tau-negative cases of amnestic dementia and may serve as a biomarker for hippocampal sclerosis.

29539391|t|Binding Modes of Phthalocyanines to Amyloid beta Peptide and Their Effects on Amyloid Fibril Formation.
29539391|a|The inherent tendency of proteins to convert from their native states into amyloid aggregates is associated with a range of human disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In that sense, the use of small molecules as probes for the structural and toxic mechanism related to amyloid aggregation has become an active area of research. Compared with other compounds, the structural and molecular basis behind the inhibitory interaction of phthalocyanine tetrasulfonate (PcTS) with proteins such as alphaS and tau has been well established, contributing to a better understanding of the amyloid aggregation process in these proteins. We present here the structural characterization of the binding of PcTS and its Cu(II) and Zn(II)-loaded forms to the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) and the impact of these interactions on the peptide amyloid fibril assembly. Elucidation of the PcTS binding modes to Abeta40 revealed the involvement of specific aromatic and hydrophobic interactions in the formation of the Abeta40-PcTS complex, ascribed to a binding mode in which the planarity and hydrophobicity of the aromatic ring system in the phthalocyanine act as main structural determinants for the interaction. Our results demonstrated that formation of the Abeta40-PcTS complex does not interfere with the progression of the peptide toward the formation of amyloid fibrils. On the other hand, conjugation of Zn(II) but not Cu(II) at the center of the PcTS macrocyclic ring modified substantially the binding profile of this phthalocyanine to Abeta40 and became crucial to reverse the effects of metal-free PcTS on the fibril assembly of the peptide. Overall, our results provide a firm basis to understand the structural rules directing phthalocyanine-protein interactions and their implications on the amyloid fibril assembly of the target proteins; in particular, our results contradict the hypothesis that PcTS might have similar mechanisms of action in slowing the formation of a variety of pathological aggregates.

29539399|t|Packing Density of the Amyloid Precursor Protein in the Cell Membrane.
29539399|a|Plasma membrane proteins organize into structures named compartments, microdomains, rafts, phases, crowds, or clusters. These structures are often smaller than 100 nm in diameter. Despite their importance in many cellular functions, little is known about their inner organization. For instance, how densely are molecules packed? Being aware of the protein compaction may contribute to our general understanding of why such structures exist and how they execute their functions. In this study, we have investigated plasma membrane crowds formed by the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a protein well known for its involvement in Alzheimer's disease. By combining biochemical experiments with conventional and super-resolution stimulated emission depletion microscopy, we quantitatively determined the protein packing density within APP crowds. We found that crowds occurring with reasonable frequency contain between 20 and 30 molecules occupying a spherical area with a diameter between 65 and 85 nm. Additionally, we found the vast majority of plasmalemmal APP residing in these crowds. The model suggests a high molecular density of protein material within plasmalemmal APP crowds. This should affect the protein's biochemical accessibility and processing by nonpathological alpha-secretases. As clustering of APP is a prerequisite for endocytic entry into the pathological processing pathway, elucidation of the packing density also provides a deeper understanding of this part of APP's life cycle.

29540588|t|Midlife cardiovascular fitness and dementia: A 44-year longitudinal population study in women.
29540588|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether greater cardiovascular fitness in midlife is associated with decreased dementia risk in women followed up for 44 years. METHODS: A population-based sample of 1,462 women 38 to 60 years of age was examined in 1968. Of these, a systematic subsample comprising 191 women completed a stepwise-increased maximal ergometer cycling test to evaluate cardiovascular fitness. Subsequent examinations of dementia incidence were done in 1974, 1980, 1992, 2000, 2005, and 2009. Dementia was diagnosed according to DSM-III-R criteria on the basis of information from neuropsychiatric examinations, informant interviews, hospital records, and registry data up to 2012. Cox regressions were performed with adjustment for socioeconomic, lifestyle, and medical confounders. RESULTS: Compared with medium fitness, the adjusted hazard ratio for all-cause dementia during the 44-year follow-up was 0.12 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.03-0.54) among those with high fitness and 1.41 (95% CI 0.72-2.79) among those with low fitness. High fitness delayed age at dementia onset by 9.5 years and time to dementia onset by 5 years compared to medium fitness. CONCLUSIONS: Among Swedish women, a high cardiovascular fitness in midlife was associated with a decreased risk of subsequent dementia. Promotion of a high cardiovascular fitness may be included in strategies to mitigate or prevent dementia. Findings are not causal, and future research needs to focus on whether improved fitness could have positive effects on dementia risk and when during the life course a high cardiovascular fitness is most important.

29545118|t|Cognitive benefits of lithium chloride in APP/PS1 mice are associated with enhanced brain clearance of beta-amyloid.
29545118|a|Epidemiological evidence suggests that people with bipolar disorder prescribed lithium exhibit a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) relative to those prescribed other mood-stabilizing medicines. Lithium chloride (LiCl) reduces brain beta-amyloid (Abeta) levels, and the brain clearance of Abeta is reduced in AD. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess whether the cognitive benefits of LiCl are associated with enhanced brain clearance of exogenously-administered Abeta. The brain clearance of intracerebroventricularly (icv) administered 125I-Abeta42 was assessed in male Swiss outbred mice administered daily oral NaCl or LiCl (300 mg/kg for 21 days). LiCl exhibited a 31% increase in the brain clearance of 125I-Abeta42 over 10 min, which was associated with a 1.6-fold increase in brain microvascular expression of the blood-brain barrier efflux transporter low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) and increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) bulk-flow. 8-month-old female wild type (WT) and APP/PS1 mice were also administered daily NaCl or LiCl for 21 days, which was followed by cognitive assessment by novel object recognition and water maze, and measurement of soluble Abeta42, plaque-associated Abeta42, and brain efflux of 125I-Abeta42. LiCl treatment restored the long-term spatial memory deficit observed in APP/PS1 mice as assessed by the water maze (back to similar levels of escape latency as WT mice), but the short-term memory deficit remained unaffected by LiCl treatment. While LiCl did not affect plaque-associated Abeta42, soluble Abeta42 levels were reduced by 49.9% in APP/PS1 mice receiving LiCl. The brain clearance of 125I-Abeta42 decreased by 27.8% in APP/PS1 mice, relative to WT mice, however, LiCl treatment restored brain 125I-Abeta42 clearance in APP/PS1 mice to a rate similar to that observed in WT mice. These findings suggest that the cognitive benefits and brain Abeta42 lowering effects of LiCl are associated with enhanced brain clearance of Abeta42, possibly via brain microvascular LRP1 upregulation and increased CSF bulk-flow, identifying a novel mechanism of protection by LiCl for the treatment of AD.

29545579|t|An acute functional screen identifies an effective antibody targeting amyloid-beta oligomers based on calcium imaging.
29545579|a|Soluble amyloid beta oligomers (AbetaOs) are widely recognized neurotoxins that trigger aberrant signaling in specific subsets of neurons, leading to accumulated neuronal damage and memory disorders in Alzheimer's disease (AD). One of the profound downstream consequences of AbetaO-triggered events is dysregulation of cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i), which has been implicated in synaptic failure, cytoskeletal abnormalities, and eventually neuronal death. We have developed an in vitro/in vivo drug screening assay to evaluate putative AbetaO-blocking candidates by measuring AbetaO-induced real-time changes in [Ca2+]i. Our screening assay demonstrated that the anti-AbetaO monoclonal antibody ACU3B3 exhibits potent blocking capability against a broad size range of AbetaOs. We showed that picomolar concentrations of AbetaOs were capable of increasing [Ca2+]i in primary neuronal cultures, an effect prevented by ACU3B3. Topical application of 5 nM AbetaOs onto exposed cortical surfaces also elicited significant calcium elevations in vivo, which was completely abolished by pre-treatment of the brain with 1 ng/mL (6.67 pM) ACU3B3. Our results provide strong support for the utility of this functional screening assay in identifying and confirming the efficacy of AbetaO-blocking drug candidates such as the human homolog of ACU3B3, which may emerge as the first experimental AD therapeutic to validate the amyloid oligomer hypothesis.

29548698|t|The on-fibrillation-pathway membrane content leakage and off-fibrillation-pathway lipid mixing induced by 40-residue beta-amyloid peptides in biologically relevant model liposomes.
29548698|a|Disruption of the synaptic plasma membrane (SPM) induced by the aggregation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides has been considered as a potential mechanism for the neurotoxicity of Abeta in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the molecular basis of such membrane disruption process remains unclear, mainly because of the severe systematic heterogeneity problem that prevents the high-resolution studies. Our previous studies using a two-component phosphatidylcholine (PC)/phosphatidylglycerol (PG) model liposome showed the presence of Abeta-induced membrane disruptions that were either on the pathway or off the pathway of fibril formation. The present study focuses on a more biologically relevant model membrane with compositions that mimic the outer leaflet of SPMs. The main findings are: (1) the two competing membrane disruption effects discovered in PC/PG liposomes and their general peptide-to-lipid-molar-ratio dependence persist in the more complicated membrane models; (2) the SPM-mimic membrane promotes the formation of certain "on-fibrillation-pathway" intermediates with higher alpha-helical structural population, which lead to more rapid and significant of membrane content leakage; (3) although the "on-fibrillation-pathway" intermediate structures show dependence on membrane compositions, there seems to be a common final fibril structure grown from different liposomes, suggesting that there may be a predominant fibril structure for 40-residue Abeta (i.e. Abeta40) peptides in biologically-relevant membranes.

29548847|t|Simultaneous quantitative susceptibility mapping and Flutemetamol-PET suggests local correlation of iron and beta-amyloid as an indicator of cognitive performance at high age.
29548847|a|The accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and recently published data suggest that increased brain iron burden may reflect pathologies that synergistically contribute to the development of cognitive dysfunction. While preclinical disease stages are considered most promising for therapeutic intervention, the link between emerging AD-pathology and earliest clinical symptoms remains largely unclear. In the current study we therefore investigated local correlations between iron and beta-amyloid plaques, and their possible association with cognitive performance in healthy older adults. 116 older adults (mean age 75 +- 7.4 years) received neuropsychological testing to calculate a composite cognitive score of performance in episodic memory, executive functioning, attention, language and communication. All participants were scanned on a combined PET-MRI instrument and were administered T1-sequences for anatomical mapping, quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) for assessing iron, and 18F-Flutemetamol-PET for estimating beta-amyloid plaque load. Biological parametric mapping (BPM) was used to generate masks indicating voxels with significant (p < 0.05) correlation between susceptibility and 18F-Flutemetamol-SUVR. We found a bilateral pattern of clusters characterized by a statistical relationship between magnetic susceptibility and 18F-Flutemetamol-SUVR, indicating local correlations between iron and beta-amyloid plaque deposition. For two bilateral clusters, located in the frontal and temporal cortex, significant relationships (p<0.05) between local beta-amyloid and the composite cognitive performance score could be observed. No relationship between whole-cortex beta-amyloid plaque load and cognitive performance was observable. Our data suggest that the local correlation of beta-amyloid plaque load and iron deposition may provide relevant information regarding cognitive performance of healthy older adults. Further studies are needed to clarify pathological correlates of the local interaction of beta-amyloid, iron and other causes of altered magnetic susceptibility.

29549223|t|Arterial stiffness and dementia pathology: Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC)-PET Study.
29549223|a|OBJECTIVE: Arterial stiffness has been associated with evidence of cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) and fibrillar beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition in the brain. These complex relationships have not been examined in racially and cognitively diverse cohorts. METHODS: The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC)-Neurocognitive Study collected detailed cognitive testing for adjudication of dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), brain MRI, and arterial stiffness by pulse wave velocity (PWV, carotid-femoral [cfPWV] and heart-carotid [hcPWV]). The ARIC-PET ancillary study added Abeta imaging using florbetapir ([18F]-AV-45) to obtain standardized uptake volume ratios and defined global Abeta-positivity as standardized uptake volume ratio >1.2. One-SD increase in PWV was related to brain volume, MRI-defined cSVD (e.g., cerebral microbleeds and white matter hyperintensity), and cortical Abeta deposition adjusted for age, body mass index, sex, race, and APOE epsilon4 status. We examined the cross-sectional relationships including interactions by race, APOE epsilon4 status, and cognition. RESULTS: Among the 320 ARIC-PET participants (76 [5] years, 45% black, 27% MCI), greater central stiffness (hcPWV) was associated with greater Abeta deposition (odds ratio [OR] = 1.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.71). Greater central stiffness (cfPWV) was significantly associated with having lower brain volumes in Alzheimer disease-susceptible regions (in mm3, beta = -1.5 [0.7 SD], p = 0.03) and high white matter hyperintensity burden (OR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.1). Furthermore, cfPWV was associated with a higher odds of concomitant high white matter hyperintensity and Abeta-positive scans (OR = 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-2.1). These associations were strongest among individuals with MCI and did not differ by race or APOE epsilon4 status. CONCLUSIONS: Arterial stiffness, measured by PWV, is an emerging risk factor for dementia through its repeated relationships with cognition, cSVD, and Abeta deposition.

29549749|t|Charge effects of self-assembled chitosan-hyaluronic acid nanoparticles on inhibiting amyloid beta-protein aggregation.
29549749|a|Amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) aggregation is crucial for the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, and surface charge of nanoparticles (NPs) has been recognized as an important factor influencing Abeta aggregation. Herein, we report a systematic study on the issue with a series of self-assembled chitosan-hyaluronic acid composite (CH) NPs of different surface charges (CH1 to CH7, zeta potentials from +38 to -35 mV). Both the positive and negative CH NPs inhibited Abeta aggregation and the inhibitory effect increased with increasing the surface charges density. Circular dichroism spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy revealed the difference in their working mechanisms. Studies at different pH values further confirmed the importance of electrostatic interactions in Abeta aggregation and presented that the effects of CH NPs changed due to the change of Abeta charge property with pH. This work has thus provided new insight into the surface charge effects on Abeta aggregation.

29550287|t|Structures and dynamics of beta-barrel oligomer intermediates of amyloid-beta16-22 aggregation.
29550287|a|Accumulating evidence suggests that soluble oligomers are more toxic than final fibrils of amyloid aggregations. Among the mixture of inter-converting intermediates with continuous distribution of sizes and secondary structures, oligomers in the beta-barrel conformation - a common class of protein folds with a closed beta-sheet - have been postulated as the toxic species with well-defined three-dimensional structures to perform pathological functions. A common mechanism for amyloid toxicity, therefore, implies that all amyloid peptides should be able to form beta-barrel oligomers as the aggregation intermediates. Here, we applied all-atom discrete molecular dynamics (DMD) simulations to evaluate the formation of beta-barrel oligomers and characterize their structures and dynamics in the aggregation of a seven-residue amyloid peptide, corresponding to the amyloid core of amyloid-beta with a sequence of 16KLVFFAE22 (Abeta16-22). We carried out aggregation simulations with various numbers of peptides to study the size dependence of aggregation dynamics and assembly structures. Consistent with previous computational studies, we observed the formation of beta-barrel oligomers in all-atom DMD simulations. Using a network-based approach to automatically identify beta-barrel conformations, we systematically characterized beta-barrels of various sizes. Our simulations revealed the conformational inter-conversion between beta-barrels and double-layer beta-sheets due to increased structural strains upon forming a closed beta-barrel while maximizing backbone hydrogen bonds. The potential of mean force analysis further characterized the free energy barriers between these two states. The obtained structural and dynamic insights of beta-barrel oligomers may help better understand the molecular mechanism of oligomer toxicities and design novel therapeutics targeting the toxic beta-barrel oligomers.

29550973|t|Amyloid and the origin of life: self-replicating catalytic amyloids as prebiotic informational and protometabolic entities.
29550973|a|A crucial stage in the origin of life was the emergence of the first molecular entity that was able to replicate, transmit information, and evolve on the early Earth. The amyloid world hypothesis posits that in the pre-RNA era, information processing was based on catalytic amyloids. The self-assembly of short peptides into beta-sheet amyloid conformers leads to extraordinary structural stability and novel multifunctionality that cannot be achieved by the corresponding nonaggregated peptides. The new functions include self-replication, catalytic activities, and information transfer. The environmentally sensitive template-assisted replication cycles generate a variety of amyloid polymorphs on which evolutive forces can act, and the fibrillar assemblies can serve as scaffolds for the amyloids themselves and for ribonucleotides proteins and lipids. The role of amyloid in the putative transition process from an amyloid world to an amyloid-RNA-protein world is not limited to scaffolding and protection: the interactions between amyloid, RNA, and protein are both complex and cooperative, and the amyloid assemblages can function as protometabolic entities catalyzing the formation of simple metabolite precursors. The emergence of a pristine amyloid-based in-put sensitive, chiroselective, and error correcting information-processing system, and the evolvement of mutualistic networks were, arguably, of essential importance in the dynamic processes that led to increased complexity, organization, compartmentalization, and, eventually, the origin of life.

In recent years, the vicious cycle between mitochondrial deficits and intra-neuronal Redox state imbalance has received considerable attention. In this regard, it is of great interest to determine whether antioxidants could alleviate mitochondrial dysfunction in AD-related conditions. Salvianolic acid B (SalB), a bioactive component of alvia miltiorrhiza Bge, is a potent antioxidant. Here we have determined the protective effect of SalB against Abeta-induced mitochondrial abnormalities. Our results showed that the application of SalB substantially alleviated intra-neuronal glutathione (GSH) and lipid oxidation and suppressed excess mitochondrial superoxide generation in Abeta-insulted neurons. Moreover, SalB has demonstrated strong protection on mitochondrial bioenergetics against Abeta toxicity evidenced by preserved mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production, as well as rescued enzymatic activities of cytochrome C oxidase and F1Fo ATP synthase. In addition, Abeta-induced axonal mitochondrial fragmentation and increased dynamin-like protein 1 phosphorylation at Ser 616 were substantially mitigated by SalB. Lastly, the application of SalB restored synaptic density in Abeta-exposed neurons. The most parsimonious interpretation of the results is that intra-neuronal oxidative stress promotes mitochondrial dysfunction in AD-relevant pathological settings, and SalB has the potential to be a promising agent for AD therapy.

29555191|t|Molecular mechanisms of membrane-associated amyloid aggregation: Computational perspective and challenges.
29555191|a|Amyloidogenic proteins are related to a variety of amyloid diseases, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The amyloid proteins in which this review focuses include amylin, Abeta, tau and alpha-synuclein. Understanding the molecular mechanisms in which these amyloidogenic proteins interact with membranes is a challenging research to both experimental and computational studies. This review illustrates recent studies on amyloid-membrane interactions, but it mainly focuses on the challenge issues related to experimental techniques to investigate at the molecular level these interactions and provides thoughts and outlook for future computational studies.

29555950|t|Zinc ion rapidly induces toxic, off-pathway amyloid-beta oligomers distinct from amyloid-beta derived diffusible ligands in Alzheimer's disease.
29555950|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease in the elderly. Zinc (Zn) ion interacts with the pathogenic hallmark, amyloid-beta (Abeta), and is enriched in senile plaques in brain of AD patients. To understand Zn-chelated Abeta (ZnAbeta) species, here we systematically characterized ZnAbeta aggregates by incubating equimolar Abeta with Zn. We found ZnAbeta40 and ZnAbeta42 both form spherical oligomers with a diameter of ~12-14 nm composed of reduced beta-sheet content. Oligomer assembly examined by analytical ultracentrifugation, hydrophobic exposure by BisANS spectra, and immunoreactivity of ZnAbeta and Abeta derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs) are distinct. The site-specific 13C labeled solid-state NMR spectra showed that ZnAbeta40 adopts beta-sheet structure as in Abeta40 fibrils. Interestingly, removal of Zn by EDTA rapidly shifted the equilibrium back to fibrillization pathway with a faster kinetics. Moreover, ZnAbeta oligomers have stronger toxicity than ADDLs by cell viability and cytotoxicity assays. The ex vivo study showed that ZnAbeta oligomers potently inhibited hippocampal LTP in the wild-type C57BL/6JNarl mice. Finally, we demonstrated that ZnAbeta oligomers stimulate hippocampal microglia activation in an acute Abeta-injected model. Overall, our study demonstrates that ZnAbeta rapidly form toxic and distinct off-pathway oligomers. The finding provides a potential target for AD therapeutic development.

29557445|t|Metal ions affect the formation and stability of amyloid beta aggregates at multiple length scales.
29557445|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) aggregates, which are a hallmark for neurodegenerative disease, are formed through a self-assembly process such as aggregation of Abeta peptide chains. This aggregation process depends on the solvent conditions under which the proteins are aggregated. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism of the ionic effect on the formation and stability of amyloid aggregates has not been fully understood. Here, we report how metal ions play a role in the formation and stability of Abeta aggregates at different length scales, i.e. oligomers and fibrils. It is shown that the metal (i.e. zinc or copper) ion increases the stability of Abeta oligomers, whereas the metal ion reduces the stability of Abeta fibrils. In addition, we found that zinc ions are able to more effectively destabilize fibril structures than copper ions. Metal ion-mediated (de)stabilization of Abeta oligomers (or fibrils) is attributed to the critical effect of the metal ion on the beta-sheet rich crystalline structure of the amyloid aggregate and the status of hydrogen bonds within the aggregate. Our study sheds light on the role of the metal ion in stabilizing the amyloid oligomers known as a toxic agent (to functional cells), which is consistent with clinical observation that high concentrations of metal ions are found in patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases.

29559198|t|New phenylaniline derivatives as modulators of amyloid protein precursor metabolism.
29559198|a|The chloroquinoline scaffold is characteristic of anti-malarial drugs such as chloroquine (CQ) or amodiaquine (AQ). These drugs are also described for their potential effectiveness against prion disease, HCV, EBV, Ebola virus, cancer, Parkinson or Alzheimer diseases. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism is deregulated in Alzheimer's disease. Indeed, CQ modifies amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism by precluding the release of amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta), which accumulate in the brain of Alzheimer patients to form the so-called amyloid plaques. We showed that AQ and analogs have similar effects although having a higher cytotoxicity. Herein, two new series of compounds were synthesized by replacing 7-chloroquinolin-4-amine moiety of AQ by 2-aminomethylaniline and 2-aminomethylphenyle moieties. Their structure activity relationship was based on their ability to modulate APP metabolism, Abeta release, and their cytotoxicity similarly to CQ. Two compounds 15a, 16a showed interesting and potent effect on the redirection of APP metabolism toward a decrease of Abeta peptide release (in the same range compared to AQ), and a 3-10-fold increased stability of APP carboxy terminal fragments (CTFalpha and AICD) without obvious cellular toxicity at 100 microM.

29561816|a|This commentary reviews the role of the Alzheimer amyloid peptide Abeta on basal synaptic transmission, synaptic short-term plasticity, as well as short- and long-term potentiation in transgenic mice, with a special focus on N-terminal truncated Abeta4-42. Abeta4-42 is highly abundant in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. It demonstrates increased neurotoxicity compared to full length Abeta, suggesting an important role in the pathogenesis of AD. Transgenic Tg4-42 mice, a model for sporadic AD, express human Abeta4-42 in Cornu Ammonis (CA1) neurons, and develop age-dependent hippocampal neuron loss and neurological deficits. In contrast to other transgenic AD mouse models, the Tg4-42 model exhibits synaptic hyperexcitability, altered synaptic short-term plasticity with no alterations in short- and long-term potentiation. The outcomes of this study are discussed in comparison with controversial results from other AD mouse models.

29562134|t|Determining the Potential of Mean Force for Amyloid-beta Dimerization: Combining Self-Consistent Field Theory with Molecular Dynamics Simulation.
29562134|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein aggregates through a complex pathway to progress from monomers to soluble oligomers and ultimately insoluble fibrils. Because of the dynamic nature of aggregation, it has proven exceedingly difficult to determine the precise interactions that lead to the formation of transient oligomers. Here, a statistical thermodynamic model has been developed to elucidate these interactions. Abeta1-42 was simulated using fully atomistic replica exchange molecular dynamics. We use an ensemble of approximately 5 x 105 configurations taken from simulation as input in a self-consistent field theory that explicitly accounts for the size, shape, and charge distribution of both the amino acids comprising Abeta and all molecular species present in solution. The solution of the model equations provides a prediction of the probabilities of the configurations of the Abeta dimer and the potential of mean force between two monomers during the dimerization process. This model constitutes a reliable methodology to elucidate the underlying physics of the Abeta dimerization process as a function of pH, temperature, and salt concentration. The results obtained with this new model could be valuable in the design of Abeta oligomerization inhibitors, a prospective therapeutic for Alzheimer's disease.

29562527|t|Oxidative Stress, Amyloid-beta Peptide, and Altered Key Molecular Pathways in the Pathogenesis and Progression of Alzheimer's Disease.
29562527|a|Oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its earlier stage, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). One source of oxidative stress in AD and aMCI brains is that associated with amyloid-beta peptide, Abeta1-42 oligomers. Our laboratory first showed in AD elevated oxidative stress occurred in brain regions rich in Abeta1-42, but not in Abeta1-42-poor regions, and was among the first to demonstrate Abeta peptides led to lipid peroxidation (indexed by HNE) in AD and aMCI brains. Oxidatively modified proteins have decreased function and contribute to damaged key biochemical and metabolic pathways in which these proteins normally play a role. Identification of oxidatively modified brain proteins by the methods of redox proteomics was pioneered in the Butterfield laboratory. Four recurring altered pathways secondary to oxidative damage in brain from persons with AD, aMCI, or Down syndrome with AD are interrelated and contribute to neuronal death. This "Quadrilateral of Neuronal Death" includes altered: glucose metabolism, mTOR activation, proteostasis network, and protein phosphorylation. Some of these pathways are altered even in brains of persons with preclinical AD. We opine that targeting these pathways pharmacologically and with lifestyle changes potentially may provide strategies to slow or perhaps one day, prevent, progression or development of this devastating dementing disorder. This invited review outlines both in vitro and in vivo studies from the Butterfield laboratory related to Abeta1-42 and AD and discusses the importance and implications of some of the major achievements of the Butterfield laboratory in AD research.

29562528|t|Metals and Alzheimer's Disease: How Far Have We Come in the Clinic?
29562528|a|It is estimated that by the year 2050 there will be more than 1.5 billion people globally over the age of 65 years. Aging is associated with changes to a number of different cellular processes which are driven by a variety of factors that contribute to the characteristic decline in function that is seen across multiple physiological domains/tissues in the elderly (including the brain). Importantly, aging is also the primary risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. As such, there is an urgent need to provide a greater understanding of both the pathogenesis and treatment of these devastating neurodegenerative disorders. One of the key cellular processes that becomes dysregulated with age and participates both directly and indirectly in age-related dysfunction, is metal homeostasis and the neurochemistry of metalloproteins, the basic science of which has been extensively reviewed in the past. In this review, we will focus on the human clinical intervention trials that have been conducted over approximately the last four decades that have attempted to establish the efficacy of targeting metal ions in the treatment of AD.

29563326|t|Extending a Systems Model of the APP Pathway: Separation of beta- and gamma-Secretase Sequential Cleavage Steps of APP.
29563326|a|The abnormal accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the brain parenchyma has been posited as a central event in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. Recently, we have proposed a systems pharmacology model of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) pathway, describing the Abeta APP metabolite responses (Abeta40, Abeta42, sAPPalpha, and sAPPbeta) to beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) inhibition. In this investigation this model was challenged to describe Abeta dynamics following gamma-secretase (GS) inhibition. This led an extended systems pharmacology model, with separate descriptions to characterize the sequential cleavage steps of APP by BACE1 and GS, to describe the differences in Abeta response to their respective inhibition. Following GS inhibition, a lower Abeta40 formation rate constant was observed, compared with BACE1 inhibition. Both BACE1 and GS inhibition were predicted to lower Abeta oligomer levels. Further model refinement and new data may be helpful to fully understand the difference in Abeta dynamics following BACE1 versus GS inhibition.

29566794|t|Tau Kinetics in Neurons and the Human Central Nervous System.
29566794|a|We developed stable isotope labeling and mass spectrometry approaches to measure the kinetics of multiple isoforms and fragments of tau in the human central nervous system (CNS) and in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons. Newly synthesized tau is truncated and released from human neurons in 3 days. Although most tau proteins have similar turnover, 4R tau isoforms and phosphorylated forms of tau exhibit faster turnover rates, suggesting unique processing of these forms that may have independent biological activities. The half-life of tau in control human iPSC-derived neurons is 6.74 +- 0.45 days and in human CNS is 23 +- 6.4 days. In cognitively normal and Alzheimer's disease participants, the production rate of tau positively correlates with the amount of amyloid plaques, indicating a biological link between amyloid plaques and tau physiology.

29571707|t|Synergistic approaches unraveling regulation and aggregation of intrinsically disordered beta-amyloids implicated in Alzheimer's disease.
29571707|a|Alzheimer's disease is a severe brain illness that causes vast numbers of nerve cells in the brain to die, driven by the production and deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) generally lack stable structures and are abundant in nature. Abeta peptide is a well-known IDP with a wide range of oligomeric forms. Dysfunctions in Abeta lead to oligomerization, formation of fibrils, and neurodegenerative disorders or other forms of dementia. In this study, we used replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) to elucidate the roles of different osmolytes, particularly urea and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), to study shifts in IDP populations. REMD samples the conformational space efficiently and at physiologically relevant temperatures, compared to conventional molecular dynamics that sample at a constant temperature. Urea is known to minimize the aggregation process, while TMAO is beneficial for its stabilizing action. The two osmolytes displayed characteristic effects on Abeta peptides and resulted in progressive modulation of conformations. The present study underlines the hypothesis of "modulation of conformational ensembles" to explain the regulation and aggregation of IDPs.

29572033|t|Role of the cell membrane interface in modulating production and uptake of Alzheimer's beta amyloid protein.
29572033|a|The beta amyloid protein (Abeta) plays a central role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis and its interaction with cell membranes in known to promote mutually disruptive structural perturbations that contribute to amyloid deposition and neurodegeneration in the brain. In addition to protein aggregation at the membrane interface and disruption of membrane integrity, growing reports demonstrate an important role for the membrane in modulating Abeta production and uptake into cells. The aim of this review is to highlight and summarize recent literature that have contributed insight into the implications of altered membrane composition on amyloid precursor protein (APP) proteolysis, production of Abeta, its internalization in to cells via permeabilization and receptor mediated uptake. Here, we also review the various membrane model systems and experimental tools used for probing Abeta-membrane interactions to investigate the key mechanistic aspects underlying the accumulation and toxicity of Abeta in AD.

29572105|t|Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and impaired cognition reflect unsuccessful neuronal compensation in the pre-plaque stage and serve as early markers for Alzheimer's disease in the APP23 mouse model.
29572105|a|Recent research on Alzheimer's disease (AD) focuses on processes prior to amyloid-beta plaque deposition accounting for the progress of the disease. However, early mechanisms of AD are still poorly understood and predictors of the disease in the pre-plaque stage essential for initiating an early therapy are lacking. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and potentially impaired cognition may serve as predictors and early clinical diagnostic markers for AD. To investigate potential BPSD and cognitive impairments in association with neuronal cell development as such markers for AD in the pre-plaque stage, female APP23 mice at eight, 19 and 31 weeks of age and corresponding control animals were tested for BPSD (elevated zero maze; sucrose preference test), motor coordination (rotarod), spatial memory and reversal learning (Morris water maze) and hippocampal neurogenesis as a neuronal correlate for hippocampus-dependent behavior. To evaluate a potential therapeutic effect of physical, cognitive and social stimulation, animals were exposed to environmental enrichment (EE) for one, twelve or 24 weeks from five weeks of age. In APP23, decreased anxiety accompanied increased agitation from eight weeks of age. Impairment of spatial memory and learning flexibility prior to plaque deposition involved an insufficient use of spatial search strategies associated with an unsuccessful compensatory increase of neurogenesis. EE had an overall beneficial effect on behavior and neurogenesis and thus constitutes a therapeutic tool to slow disease progression. BPSD, cognition and associated impaired neurogenesis complement clinical diagnostic markers for pre-plaque AD and contribute to an early detection essential to halt disease progression.

29572282|t|Memory decline accompanies subthreshold amyloid accumulation.
29572282|a|OBJECTIVE: Extensive cortical beta-amyloid (Abeta positivity) has been linked to cognitive decline, but the clinical significance of elevations in Abeta within the negative range is unknown. METHODS: We examined amyloid and cognitive trajectories (memory, executive function) in 142 cognitively normal older individuals enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative who were Abeta-negative at baseline and who had at least 2 [18F]-florbetapir PET scans over 3.9 +- 1.4 years. We determined whether Abeta accumulation was associated with longitudinal changes in memory or executive function. RESULTS: Among baseline-negative individuals, florbetapir slope (mean annual increase 0.002 +- 0.008 standardized uptake value ratio units/y) was not related to age, sex, education, APOE4 status, baseline memory or executive function, temporoparietal glucose metabolism, baseline hippocampal volume, or hippocampal volume change; but it was related to higher baseline cortical florbetapir, indicating that Abeta accumulation was ongoing at baseline in those who accumulated during the study. Over the course of follow-up, 13 individuals converted to florbetapir+ and 14 nearly nonoverlapping individuals converted to mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer disease. Amyloid accumulation among baseline-negative individuals was associated with poorer longitudinal memory performance (p = 0.019), but it was not associated with changes in executive function. Reducing the sample to individuals with at least 3 timepoints to estimate the florbetapir slope strengthened the relationship further between florbetapir accumulation and memory decline (p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Memory decline accompanies Abeta accumulation in otherwise healthy, Abeta-negative older adults. Amyloid increases within the negative range may represent the earliest detectable indication of pathology with domain-specific cognitive consequences.

29572646|t|Knockout of Amyloid beta Protein Precursor (APP) Expression Alters Synaptogenesis, Neurite Branching and Axonal Morphology of Hippocampal Neurons.
29572646|a|The function of the beta-A4 amyloid protein precursor (APP) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear. APP has a number of putative roles in neuronal differentiation, survival, synaptogenesis and cell adhesion. In this study, we examined the development of axons, dendrites and synapses in cultures of hippocampus neutrons derived from APP knockout (KO) mice. We report that loss of APP function reduces the branching of cultured hippocampal neurons, resulting in reduced synapse formation. Using a compartmentalised culture approach, we found reduced axonal outgrowth in cultured hippocampal neurons and we also identified abnormal growth characteristics of isolated hippocampal neuron axons. Although APP has previously been suggested to play an important role in promoting cell adhesion, we surprisingly found that APPKO hippocampal neurons adhered more strongly to a poly-L-lysine substrate and their neurites displayed an increased density of focal adhesion puncta. The findings suggest that the function of APP has an important role in both dendritic and axonal growth and that endogenous APP may regulate substrate adhesion of hippocampal neurons. The results may explain neuronal and synaptic morphological abnormalities in APPKO mice and the presence of abnormal APP expression in dystrophic neurites around amyloid deposits in AD.

29574591|t|Capillary cerebral amyloid angiopathy in Alzheimer's disease: association with allocortical/hippocampal microinfarcts and cognitive decline.
29574591|a|Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is caused by the deposition of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) in the wall of cerebral and leptomeningeal blood vessels and is related to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Capillary Abeta deposition is observed in a subset of CAA cases and represents a distinct type of CAA named capillary CAA or CAA type 1. This type of CAA is strongly associated with the presence of the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele. CAA type 1-associated AD cases often exhibit a more severe Abeta plaque pathology but less widespread neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology. The objective of this study was to analyze whether capillary CAA and its effects on cerebral blood flow have an impact on dementia. To address this objective, we performed neuropathological evaluation of 284 autopsy cases of demented and non-demented individuals. We assessed the presence of CAA and its subtypes as well as for that of hemorrhages and infarcts. Capillary CAA and CAA severity were associated with allocortical microinfarcts, comprising the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Allocortical microinfarcts, capillary CAA and CAA severity were, thereby, associated with cognitive decline. In conclusion, allocortical microinfarcts, CAA severity, and the capillary type of CAA were associated with one another and with the development of cognitive decline. Thus, AD cases with CAA type 1 (capillary CAA) appear to develop dementia symptoms not only due to AD-related Abeta plaque and NFT pathology but also due to hippocampal microinfarcts that are associated with CAA type 1 and CAA severity, and that damage a brain region important for memory function.

29575445|a|Various cytotoxic mechanisms for neurodegenerative disease are induced by specific conformations of Abeta intermediates. The efforts to understand the diverse intermediate forms of amyloid oligomers have been focused on understanding the aggregation mechanism of specific morphologies for Abeta intermediates. However, these are still not easy tasks to be accomplished because the diverse conformations of Abeta intermediates can be altered during the aggregation process, even though the same Abeta monomers are present. Thus, efforts to reveal the conformational change mechanism could be a fundamental process to understand the formation of diverse Abeta intermediate conformations. Here, we evaluate the conformational characteristics of Abeta17-42 fibrillar oligomers in different environments according to the length. We observed that Abeta fibrillar oligomers optimize their inherent hydrogen bonds and configurational entropy to stabilize their structure according to the simulation time and their length increase. In addition, we revealed the role of the expressed vibration mode shape in the fibrillar oligomers' elongation and deformation processes. Our results suggest that limitations in amyloid oligomer growth and transformations of their morphologies can be regulated and controlled by modifying the vibration features.

29577153|t|Time dependence of NMR observables reveals salient differences in the accumulation of early aggregated species between human islet amyloid polypeptide and amyloid-beta.
29577153|a|Type 2 diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer's disease are characterized by the accumulation of fibrillar amyloid deposits consisting mainly of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) and amyloid-beta (Abeta), respectively. Fibril formation is a multi-step nucleation process that involves the transient build-up of oligomeric species that are thought to be the most toxic components. To gain more insight into the molecular mechanism of early IAPP aggregated species formation, we performed a combination of direct and indirect biophysical approaches on IAPP and also on Abeta42 for the sake of comparison. Thioflavin T fluorescence kinetics measurements revealed a stronger autocatalytic behaviour of IAPP and a weaker concentration dependence of fibrillization half-time t1/2, as compared to Abeta42. Our NMR experiments highlight the absence of micelle reservoir or supercritical regime in the studied concentration range, indicating that the low concentration dependence of IAPP fibril formation can be ascribed to saturable pathways. IAPP and Abeta42 displayed marked differences in formation of oligomeric species, as observed by 1D 1H, pulsed-field gradient (PFG) diffusion and saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR experiments. A fast equilibrium between monomer and oligomeric species was detected in the case of Abeta42 but not IAPP, with a significant build-up of aggregated species, as shown by the time dependence of diffusion coefficient and STD magnetization transfer efficiency during the aggregation process. Altogether our data show significant differences between IAPP and Abeta42 regarding the microscopic events of amyloid species formation.

29578479|t|Comprehensive Characterization of the Pyroglutamate Amyloid-beta Induced Motor Neurodegenerative Phenotype of TBA2.1 Mice.
29578479|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and is being intensively investigated using a broad variety of animal models. Many of these models express mutant versions of human amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) that are associated with amyloid-beta protein (Abeta)-induced early onset familial AD. Most of these models, however, do not develop bold neurodegenerative pathology and the respective phenotypes. Nevertheless, this may well be essential for their suitability to identify therapeutically active compounds that have the potential for a curative or at least disease-modifying therapy in humans. In this study, the new transgenic mouse model TBA2.1 was explored in detail to increase knowledge about the neurodegenerative process induced by the presence of pyroglutamate modified human Abeta3-42 (pEAbeta3-42). Analysis of the sensorimotor phenotype, motor coordination, Abeta pathology, neurodegeneration, and gliosis revealed formation and progression of severe pathology and phenotypes including massive neuronal loss in homozygous TBA2.1 mice within a few months. In contrast, the start of a slight phenotype was observed only after 21 months in heterozygous mice. These data highlight the role of pEAbeta3-42 in the disease development and progression of AD. Based on the findings of this study, homozygous TBA2.1 mice can be utilized to gain deeper understanding in the underlying mechanisms of pEAbeta3-42 and might be suitable as an animal model for treatment studies targeting toxic Abeta species, complementary to the well described transgenic AbetaPP mouse models.

29578485|t|Cysteine-Rich Repeat Domains 2 and 4 are Amyloid-beta Binding Domains of Neurotrophin Receptor p75NTR and Potential Targets to Block Amyloid-beta Neurotoxicity.
29578485|a|The p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) is an amyloid-beta (Abeta) receptor that both mediates Abeta neurotoxicity and regulates Abeta production and deposition, thus playing an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The extracellular domain of p75NTR (p75ECD), consisting of four cysteine-rich repeat domains (CRDs), was recently reported to be an endogenous anti-Abeta scavenger to block p75NTR-mediated neuronal death and neurite degeneration signaling of Abeta and pro-neurotrophins. Identification of the specific Abeta binding domains of p75NTR is crucial for illuminating their interactions and the etiology of AD. CRDs of p75ECD were obtained by expression of recombinant plasmids or direct synthesis. Abeta aggregation inhibiting test and immunoprecipitation assay were applied to locate the specific binding domains of Abeta to p75ECD. The Abeta neurotoxicity antagonistic effects of different CRDs were examined by cytotoxicity experiments including neurite outgrowth assay, propidium iodide (PI) staining, and MTT assay. In the Abeta aggregation inhibiting test, the fluorescence intensity in the CRD2 and CRD4 treatment groups was significantly lower than that in the CRD1 and CRD3 treatment groups. Immunoprecipitation assay and western blot confirmed that Abeta could bind to CRD2 and CRD4. Besides, CRD2 and CRD4 antagonized Abeta neurotoxicity suggested by longer neurite length, less PI labelled cells, and higher cell viability than the control group. Our results indicate that CRD2 and CRD4 are Abeta binding domains of p75NTR and capable of antagonizing Abeta neurotoxicity, and therefore are potential therapeutic targets to block the interaction of Abeta and p75NTR in the pathogenesis of AD.

29579708|t|Punicalagin ameliorates the elevation of plasma homocysteine, amyloid-beta, TNF-alpha and apoptosis by advocating antioxidants and modulating apoptotic mediator proteins in brain.
29579708|a|The present study investigated the neuroprotective role of punicalagin, a major polyphenolic compound of pomegranate on methionine-induced brain injury. Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) was induced in two months old male BALB c mice by methionine supplementation in drinking water (1 g/kg body weight) for 30 days. Punicalagin (1 mg/kg) was injected i.p every other day concurrently with methionine. Punicalagin significantly prevented the rise in the levels of homocysteine, amyloid-beta and TNF-alpha. HHcy is associated with a decrease in the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (PGx) and glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione (GSH) levels in the brains of methionine-treated mice while these antioxidants are increased by punicalagin supplementation. The treatment with punicalagin significantly decreased oxidative stress as indicated by decreased malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl formation in the brain. Compared with methionine-treated animals, mice that treated with methionine and punicalagin remarkably displayed less apoptosis, indicated by the lower level of proapoptotic protein (Bax, caspases- 3, 9 and p53) and higher levels of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein than those in hyperhomocysteinemic mice. The potent bioactivity of punicalagin extends to protect neuronal DNA as evidenced by the inhibition of the increase of comet parameters compared to the methionine-treated mice. In conclusion, punicalagin protected from methionine-induced HHcy and brain damage with an ability to repress apoptosis by modulating apoptotic mediators and maintaining DNA integrity in the brain of mice.

29580771|t|Interactions of amyloid-beta peptides on lipid bilayer studied by single molecule imaging and tracking.
29580771|a|The amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta40 and Abeta42) feature prominently in the synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). This has been proposed to be due either to interactions between Abeta and cell surface receptors affecting cell signaling, or to the formation of calcium-permeable channels in the membrane that disrupt calcium homeostasis. In both mechanisms the cell membrane is the primary cellular structure with which Abeta interacts. Abeta concentrations in human bodily fluids are very low (pM-nM) rendering studies of the size, composition, cellular binding sites and mechanism of action of the oligomers formed in vivo very challenging. Most studies, therefore, have utilized Abeta oligomers prepared at micromolar peptide concentrations, where Abeta forms oligomeric species which possess easily observable cell toxicity. Such toxicity has not been observed when nM concentrations of peptide are used in the experiment highlighting the importance of employing physiologically relevant peptide concentrations for the results to be of biological significance. In this paper single-molecule microscopy was used to monitor Abeta oligomer formation and diffusion on a supported lipid bilayer at nanomolar peptide concentrations. Abeta monomers, the dominant species in solution, tightly associate with the membrane and are highly mobile whereas trimers and higher-order oligomers are largely immobile. Abeta dimers exist in a mixture of mobile and immobile states. Oligomer growth on the membrane is more rapid for Abeta40 than for the more amyloidogenic Abeta42 but is largely inhibited for a 1:1 Abeta40:Abeta42 mixture. The mechanism underlying these Abeta40-Abeta42 interactions may feature in Alzheimer's pathology.

29581486|t|Distinct thermodynamic signatures of oligomer generation in the aggregation of the amyloid-beta peptide.
29581486|a|Mapping free-energy landscapes has proved to be a powerful tool for studying reaction mechanisms. Many complex biomolecular assembly processes, however, have remained challenging to access using this approach, including the aggregation of peptides and proteins into amyloid fibrils implicated in a range of disorders. Here, we generalize the strategy used to probe free-energy landscapes in protein folding to determine the activation energies and entropies that characterize each of the molecular steps in the aggregation of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta42), which is associated with Alzheimer's disease. Our results reveal that interactions between monomeric Abeta42 and amyloid fibrils during fibril-dependent secondary nucleation fundamentally reverse the thermodynamic signature of this process relative to primary nucleation, even though both processes generate aggregates from soluble peptides. By mapping the energetic and entropic contributions along the reaction trajectories, we show that the catalytic efficiency of Abeta42 fibril surfaces results from the enthalpic stabilization of adsorbing peptides in conformations amenable to nucleation, resulting in a dramatic lowering of the activation energy for nucleation.

29592885|t|Resistance vs resilience to Alzheimer disease: Clarifying terminology for preclinical studies.
29592885|a|Preventing or delaying Alzheimer disease (AD) through lifestyle interventions will come from a better understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of (1) why a significant proportion of elderly remain cognitively normal with AD pathologies (ADP), i.e., amyloid or tau; and (2) why some elderly individuals do not have significant ADP. In the last decades, concepts such as brain reserve, cognitive reserve, and more recently brain maintenance have been proposed along with more general notions such as (neuro)protection and compensation. It is currently unclear how to effectively apply these concepts in the new field of preclinical AD specifically separating the 2 distinct mechanisms of coping with pathology vs avoiding pathology. We propose a simplistic conceptual framework that builds on existing concepts using the nomenclature of resistance in the context of avoiding pathology, i.e., remaining cognitively normal without significant ADP, and resilience in the context of coping with pathology, i.e., remaining cognitively normal despite significant ADP. In the context of preclinical AD studies, we (1) define these concepts and provide recommendations (and common scenarios) for their use; (2) discuss how to employ this terminology in the context of investigating mechanisms and factors; (3) highlight the complementarity and clarity they provide to existing concepts; and (4) discuss different study designs and methodologies. The application of the proposed framework for framing hypotheses, study design, and interpretation of results and mechanisms can provide a consistent framework and nomenclature for researchers to reach consensus on identifying factors that may prevent ADP or delay the onset of cognitive impairment.

29596966|a|In Alzheimer's disease (AD) the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is compromised, thus therapeutic targeting of the BBB to enhance its integrity and function could be a unique approach to treat, slow or hold the progression of AD. Recently, we have developed an in vitro high-throughput screening assay to screen for compounds that increase the integrity of a cell-based BBB model. Results from primary screen identified multiple hit compounds that enhanced the monolayer integrity. Herein, further characterization of selected hit compounds, namely 8-bromoguanosine cyclic monophosphate, JW74, 1,10-phenanthroline monohydrate, SB216763 and alpha-tocopherol was performed. Compounds were subjected to concentration-dependent studies to determine their EC50 and potency to enhance the cell-based model integrity by the Lucifer Yellow permeability and amyloid-beta (Abeta) transport across the monolayer. The compounds demonstrated different EC50s to enhance the monolayer integrity ranging from 0.4 to 12.8 microM, and different effect on enhancing Abeta transport with highest transport observed for alpha-tocopherol (2.2-fold increase). Such effects were associated with increased levels of tight junction proteins such as claudin-5 and/or ZO-1, and Abeta major transport proteins LRP1 and P-glycoprotein. In vivo studies for alpha-tocopherol were performed in AD mouse model; consistent with the in vitro results alpha-tocopherol significantly increased BBB integrity measured by IgG extravasation, and reduced brain Abeta levels. In conclusion, findings support our developed cell-based BBB model as a functional predictive in vivo tool to select hit compounds, and suggest that enhancing BBB tightness and function has the potential to reduce Abeta pathology associated with AD.

29600961|t|Targeting of nonlipidated, aggregated apoE with antibodies inhibits amyloid accumulation.
29600961|a|The apolipoprotein E E4 allele of the APOE gene is the strongest genetic factor for late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD). There is compelling evidence that apoE influences Alzheimer disease (AD) in large part by affecting amyloid beta (Abeta) aggregation and clearance; however, the molecular mechanism underlying these findings remains largely unknown. Herein, we tested whether anti-human apoE antibodies can decrease Abeta pathology in mice producing both human Abeta and apoE4, and investigated the mechanism underlying these effects. We utilized APPPS1-21 mice crossed to apoE4-knockin mice expressing human apoE4 (APPPS1-21/APOE4). We discovered an anti-human apoE antibody, anti-human apoE 4 (HAE-4), that specifically recognizes human apoE4 and apoE3 and preferentially binds nonlipidated, aggregated apoE over the lipidated apoE found in circulation. HAE-4 also binds to apoE in amyloid plaques in unfixed brain sections and in living APPPS1-21/APOE4 mice. When delivered centrally or by peripheral injection, HAE-4 reduced Abeta deposition in APPPS1-21/APOE4 mice. Using adeno-associated virus to express 2 different full-length anti-apoE antibodies in the brain, we found that HAE antibodies decreased amyloid accumulation, which was dependent on Fcgamma receptor function. These data support the hypothesis that a primary mechanism for apoE-mediated plaque formation may be a result of apoE aggregation, as preferentially targeting apoE aggregates with therapeutic antibodies reduces Abeta pathology and may represent a selective approach to treat AD.

29600962|t|Targeting the accomplice to thwart the culprit: a new target for the prevention of amyloid deposition.
29600962|a|Inheritance of the E4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE4) substantially increases the risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD). A large body of evidence has firmly established a role for apoE in modulating the risk of developing the amyloid plaque pathology that is pathognomonic for AD. In this issue of the JCI, Liao and colleagues discovered that antibodies against a nonlipidated form of apoE4 are highly effective in delaying the deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides in mouse models of AD pathology. Using a combination of passive immunization and viral-mediated expression of recombinant antibodies, the authors show that Fc receptor-mediated clearance of the nonlipidated apoE4 was critical in delaying Abeta deposition. Collectively, this study identifies a new therapeutic target that could be exploited to prevent, or possibly reverse, the Abeta pathology of AD.

29602697|t|Protein Phase Separation: A New Phase in Cell Biology.
29602697|a|Cellular compartments and organelles organize biological matter. Most well-known organelles are separated by a membrane boundary from their surrounding milieu. There are also many so-called membraneless organelles and recent studies suggest that these organelles, which are supramolecular assemblies of proteins and RNA molecules, form via protein phase separation. Recent discoveries have shed light on the molecular properties, formation, regulation, and function of membraneless organelles. A combination of techniques from cell biology, biophysics, physical chemistry, structural biology, and bioinformatics are starting to help establish the molecular principles of an emerging field, thus paving the way for exciting discoveries, including novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of age-related disorders.

29604335|t|Identification of prion protein-derived peptides of potential use in Alzheimer's disease therapy.
29604335|a|Soluble form of the prion protein (PrP) has been previously shown to interact with amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides, suppressing their fibrillization as well as toxicity, which indicates that this protein may play a protective role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The shortest known PrP fragment retaining all of these properties corresponds to physiologically generated proteolytic polypeptide PrP23-110/111, called N1. Here we have identified two N1-derived synthetic peptides, encompassing residues 23-50 (PrP23-50) and 90-112 (PrP90-112), which bind to Abeta1-42 protofibrillar oligomers as well as amyloid fibrils. We found that, akin to N1, the abovementioned synthetic peptides not only reduce the initial rate of Abeta fibrillization, but also alter the aggregation pathway of Abeta, inhibiting formation of protofibrillar oligomers and facilitating amorphous aggregation. Furthermore, our data show that N1, PrP23-50 and PrP90-112 protect cultured hippocampal neurons from neurotoxic effects of Abeta oligomers, preventing oligomers-induced retraction of neurites and loss of cell membrane integrity. The above PrP fragments can also attenuate neuronal intake of Abeta. Our results strongly suggest that synthetic peptides such as PrP23-50 and PrP90-112 can be useful in designing a novel class of therapeutics in AD.

29604402|t|Effects of aquatic and land-based exercises on amyloid beta, heat shock protein 27, and pulse wave velocity in elderly women.
29604402|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative brain disease resulting from the deterioration of neuronal cells and vascular dementia, the latter of which results from cerebrovascular disorders. Exercise is effective in preventing and treating degenerative brain diseases as it activates blood flow to the brain, increases nerve production in the hippocampus, and promotes the expression of synaptic plasticity-related proteins. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of 16-week aquatic and land-based exercise programs on amyloid beta (Abeta), heat shock protein (HSP) 27 levels, and pulse wave velocity (PWV). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty elderly women, aged 60-70 years, voluntarily participated in the study. They were divided into control (n = 12), aquatic exercise (n = 14), and land-based exercise groups (n = 14). The variables of amyloid beta, heat shock protein 27, and pulse wave velocity were measured in all the participants before and after the 16-week study. RESULTS: Significantly higher levels of serum HSP27 (p < 0.05) and significantly lower levels of vascular elasticity (p < 0.05) were found in the aquatic exercise group after 16 weeks of exercise compared with the control group. Abeta did not significantly differ between groups. Thirty minutes after the first exercise, Abeta in the aquatic exercise group (p < 0.01) and HSP27 in the land-based exercise group (p < 0.05) were significantly higher than the corresponding levels in the resting condition before exercise. 30 min after the last exercise, Abeta (p < 0.01) and HSP27 (p < 0.05) were significantly higher. CONCLUSIONS: Aquatic and land-based exercises increased serum Abeta and HSP27 and decreased pulse wave velocity. Thus, they may play a positive role in the prevention of degenerative brain diseases and improvement of brain function in elderly people.

29605222|t|Imaging correlations of tau, amyloid, metabolism, and atrophy in typical and atypical Alzheimer's disease.
29605222|a|INTRODUCTION: Neuroimaging modalities can measure different aspects of the disease process in Alzheimer's disease, although the relationship between these modalities is unclear. METHODS: We assessed subject-level regional correlations between tau on [18F]AV-1451 positron emission tomography (PET), beta amyloid on Pittsburgh compound B PET, hypometabolism on [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose PET, and cortical thickness on magnetic resonance imaging in 96 participants with typical and atypical Alzheimer's disease presentations. We also assessed how correlations between modalities varied according to age, presenting syndrome, tau-PET severity, and asymmetry. RESULTS: [18F]AV-1451 uptake showed the strongest regional correlation with hypometabolism. Correlations between [18F]AV-1451 uptake and both hypometabolism and cortical thickness were stronger in participants with greater cortical tau severity. In addition, age, tau asymmetry, and clinical diagnosis influenced the strength of the correlation between [18F]AV-1451 uptake and cortical thickness. DISCUSSION: These findings support a close relationship between tau and hypometabolism in Alzheimer's disease but show that correlations between neuroimaging modalities vary across participants.

29605485|t|A cAMP analog attenuates beta-amyloid (1-42)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and spatial learning and memory deficits.
29605485|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder in elderly, is indicated with deposition of Amyloid beta (Abeta) in the brain and accompanied with cognitive impairment. Bucladesine, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, may ameliorate AD's cognitive dysfunctions through mimicking the action of cAMP and raising its intracellular level. Here, we investigated the effects of bucladesine on Abeta-induced memory and learning impairment in a Morris water maze (MWM) model. Rats were injected with bucladesine (1 mul/side from a 100 muM stock solution) and Abeta (1 mul/side from a 100 muM stock solution) intra-hippocampally and after 19 days were trained for 4 successive days. The oxidative stress was evaluated through measurement of thiobarbituric acid (TBARS), thiol groups, and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). Effect of Abeta and its combination with bucladesine on the mitochondrial function was assessed according to changes in the ROS generation, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), mitochondrial swelling, ATP/ADP ratio, mitochondrial outer membrane damage and cytochrome C release. Our results showed a significant elevation in TBARS level after administration of Abeta causing mitochondrial ROS generation, swelling, outer membrane damage, cytochrome C release and also lower thiol, FRAP, and MMP levels. Abeta-induced spatial memory impairment was prevented by pre-treatment with bucladesine and the changed mitochondrial and biochemical indices upon treatment dose were improved. Taken together, we have obtained satisfactory results suggesting protecting effects of bucladesine against the Abeta-mediated memory deficit and implying its plausible beneficial capacity as a therapeutic agent in oxidative stress-associated neurodegenerative diseases.

29607920|t|Nobiletin Reduces Intracellular and Extracellular beta-Amyloid in iPS Cell-Derived Alzheimer's Disease Model Neurons.
29607920|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, with progressive memory impairment. Recently, neprilysin, a beta-amyloid (Abeta)-degrading enzyme has become featured as a drug target for AD. Previously, we identified nobiletin from citrus peels as a natural compound possessing anti-dementia activity. In addition, we demonstrated that nobiletin improved memory in memory-impaired animals and, further, that Abeta levels were markedly decreased in the brains of these animals. We demonstrated in vitro that nobiletin up-regulates neprilysin expression and activity in human neuroblastoma cells. However, the action of nobiletin with regard to Abeta degradation under in vitro AD pathological conditions remains unclear. In this study, we examined whether nobiletin could enhance the degradation of intra- and extracellular Abeta using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived AD model neurons, which generate an excess of Abeta1-42 due to the familial AD presenilin-1 mutation. The neurons were treated in the presence or absence of nobiletin. The results of real-time quantitative RT-PCR indicated that neprilysin mRNA levels were significantly up-regulated by nobiletin. Furthermore, immunostaining with an anti-Abeta antibody revealed that nobiletin substantially reduced the intraneuronal content of Abeta. Interestingly, the results of Abeta1-42 immunoassays confirmed that nobiletin also significantly decreased the levels of Abeta1-42 released into the cellular medium. These results suggest that nobiletin enhanced the reduction of intra- and that extracellular Abeta levels under AD pathologic conditions, and this is associated with the up-regulation of neprilysin expression. Collectively, nobiletin appears to be a promising novel prophylactic seed drug or functional food for AD.

29609516|t|A Systematic Review of Positron Emission Tomography of Tau, Amyloid Beta, and Neuroinflammation in Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy: The Evidence To Date.
29609516|a|Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is associated with pathological changes, yet detecting these changes during life has proven elusive. Positron emission tomography (PET) offers the potential for identifying such pathology. Few studies have been completed to date and their approaches and results have been diverse. It was the objective of this review to systematically examine relevant research using ligands for PET that bind to identified pathology in CTE. We focused on identification of patterns of binding and addressing gaps in knowledge of PET imaging for CTE. A comprehensive literature search was conducted. Data used were published on or before May 22, 2017. As the extant literature is limited, any peer-reviewed article assessing military, contact sports athletes, or professional fighters was considered for inclusion. The main outcomes were regional binding to brain regions identified through control comparisons or through clinical metrics (e.g., standardized uptake volume ratios). A total of 1207 papers were identified for review, of which six met inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses were planned but were deemed inappropriate given the small number of studies identified. Methodological concerns in these initial papers included small sample sizes, lack of a control comparison, use of nonstandard statistical procedures to quantify data, and interpretation of potentially off-target binding areas. Across studies, the hippocampi, amygdalae, and midbrain had reasonably consistent increased uptake. Evidence for increased uptake in cortical regions was less consistent. The evidence suggests that the field of PET imaging in those at risk for CTE remains nascent. As the field evolves to include more stringent studies, ligands for PET may prove an important tool in identifying CTE in vivo.

29611693|t|Lipid-Modified Graphene-Transistor Biosensor for Monitoring Amyloid-beta Aggregation.
29611693|a|A graphene field-effect transistor (G-FET) with the spacious planar graphene surface can provide a large-area interface with cell membranes to serve as a platform for the study of cell membrane-related protein interactions. In this study, a G-FET device paved with a supported lipid bilayer (referred to as SLB/G-FET) was first used to monitor the catalytic hydrolysis of the SLB by phospholipase D. With excellent detection sensitivity, this G-FET was also modified with a ganglioside GM1-enriched SLB (GM1-SLB/G-FET) to detect cholera toxin B. Finally, the GM1-SLB/G-FET was employed to monitor amyloid-beta 40 (Abeta40) aggregation. In the early nucleation stage of Abeta40 aggregation, while no fluorescence was detectable with traditional thioflavin T (ThT) assay, the prominent electrical signals probed by GM1-SLB/G-FET demonstrate that the G-FET detection is more sensitive than the ThT assay. The comprehensive kinetic information during the Abeta40 aggregation could be collected with a GM1-SLB/G-FET, especially covering the kinetics involved in the early stage of Abeta40 aggregation. These experimental results suggest that SLB/G-FETs hold great potential as a powerful biomimetic sensor for versatile investigations of membrane-related protein functions and interaction kinetics.

29611698|t|Ascorbate Oxidation by Cu(Amyloid-beta) Complexes: Determination of the Intrinsic Rate as a Function of Alterations in the Peptide Sequence Revealing Key Residues for Reactive Oxygen Species Production.
29611698|a|Along with aggregation of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide and subsequent deposit of amyloid plaques, oxidative stress is an important feature in Alzheimer's disease. Cu bound to Abeta is able to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the successive reductions of molecular dioxygen, and the ROS produced contribute to oxidative stress. In vitro, ascorbate consumption parallels ROS production, where ascorbate is the reductant that fuels the reactions. Because the affinity of Cu for Abeta is moderate compared to other biomolecules, the rate of ascorbate consumption is a combination of two contributions. The first one is due to peptide-unbound Cu and the second one to peptide-bound Cu complexes. In the present Article, we aim to determine the amounts of the second contribution in the global ascorbate consumption process. It is defined as the intrinsic rate of ascorbate oxidation, which mathematically corresponds to the rate at an infinite peptide to Cu ratio, i.e., without any contribution from peptide-unbound Cu. We show that, for the wild-type Cu(Abeta) complex, this value equals 10% of the value obtained for peptide-unbound Cu and that this value is strongly dependent on peptide alterations. By examination of the dependence of the intrinsic rate of ascorbate oxidation, followed by UV-vis spectroscopy, for several altered peptides, we determine some of the key residues that influence ROS production.

29613789|t|Design and Synthesis of Clinical Candidate PF-06751979: A Potent, Brain Penetrant, beta-Site Amyloid Precursor Protein Cleaving Enzyme 1 (BACE1) Inhibitor Lacking Hypopigmentation.
29613789|a|A major challenge in the development of beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) inhibitors for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease is the alignment of potency, drug-like properties, and selectivity over related aspartyl proteases such as Cathepsin D (CatD) and BACE2. The potential liabilities of inhibiting BACE2 chronically have only recently begun to emerge as BACE2 impacts the processing of the premelanosome protein (PMEL17) and disrupts melanosome morphology resulting in a depigmentation phenotype. Herein, we describe the identification of clinical candidate PF-06751979 (64), which displays excellent brain penetration, potent in vivo efficacy, and broad selectivity over related aspartyl proteases including BACE2. Chronic dosing of 64 for up to 9 months in dog did not reveal any observation of hair coat color (pigmentation) changes and suggests a key differentiator over current BACE1 inhibitors that are nonselective against BACE2 in later stage clinical development.

29614651|t|Amyloid-beta Induces AMPA Receptor Ubiquitination and Degradation in Primary Neurons and Human Brains of Alzheimer's Disease.
29614651|a|As the primary mediator for synaptic transmission, AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are crucial for synaptic plasticity and higher brain functions. A downregulation of AMPAR expression has been indicated as one of the early pathological molecular alterations in Alzheimer's disease (AD), presumably via amyloid-beta (Abeta). However, the molecular mechanisms leading to the loss of AMPARs remain less clear. We report that in primary neurons, application of Abeta triggers AMPAR internalization accompanied with a decrease in cell-surface AMPAR expression. Importantly, in both Abeta-treated neurons and human brain tissue from AD patients, we observed a significant decrease in total AMPAR amount and an enhancement in AMPAR ubiquitination. Consistent with facilitated receptor degradation, AMPARs show higher turnover rates in the presence of Abeta. Furthermore, AD brain lysates and Abeta-incubated neurons show increased expression of the AMPAR E3 ligase Nedd4 and decreased expression of AMPAR deubiquitinase USP46. Changes in these enzymes are responsible for the Abeta-dependent AMPAR reduction. These findings indicate that AMPAR ubiquitination acts as the key molecular event leading to the loss of AMPARs and thus suppressed synaptic transmission in AD.

29614660|t|Stimulation of SIRT1 Attenuates the Level of Oxidative Stress in the Brains of APP/PS1 Double Transgenic Mice and in Primary Neurons Exposed to Oligomers of the Amyloid-beta Peptide.
29614660|a|In the study, we examined whether the silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) can attenuate oxidative stress in the brains of mice carrying the APP/PS1 double mutation and/or in primary neonatal rat neurons exposed to oligomers of amyloid-beta peptide (AbetaOs). Starting at 4 or 8 months of age, the transgenic mice were treated with resveratrol (RSV, a stimulator of SIRT1) or suramin (an inhibitor) (each 20 mg/kg BW/day) for two months. The primary neurons were exposed to AbetaOs (0.5 muM) for 48 h and thereafter RSV (20 muM) or suramin (300 mg/ml) for 24 h. Cell viability was assessed by the CCK-8 assay; SIRT1 protein and mRNA determined by western blotting and real-time PCR, respectively; senile plaques examined immunohistochemically; ROS monitored by flow cytometry; and the contents of OH-, H2O2, O2 -, and MDA, and the activities of SOD and GSH-Px measured by standard biochemical procedures. In comparison to wild-type mice or untreated primary neurons, the expression of SIRT1 was significantly lower in the brains of APP/PS1 mice or neurons exposed to AbetaOs. In these same systems, increased numbers of senile plaques and a high level of oxidative stress were apparent. Interestingly, these two latter changes were attenuated by treatment with RSV, but enhanced by suramin. These findings indicate that SIRT1 may be neuroprotective.

29614661|t|Hippocampal Sclerosis in the Oldest Old: A Finnish Population-Based Study.
29614661|a|BACKGROUND: There are only few population-based studies that have systemically investigated the prevalence of hippocampal sclerosis (HS) in the very old. The frequency of unilateral versus bilateral HS has been rarely studied. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the prevalence and laterality of HS and its association with other neurodegenerative and vascular pathologies in a population-based sample of very elderly. Furthermore, the concomitant presence of immunoreactivity for TDP-43, p62, and HPtau was studied. METHODS: The population-based Vantaa 85+ study includes all inhabitants of the city of Vantaa, who were >85 years in 1991 (n = 601). Neuropathological assessment was possible in 302 subjects. Severity of neuronal loss of CA sectors and subiculum was determined bilaterally by HE- staining. Immunohistochemistry performed using antibodies for TDP-43, p62, and HPtau. RESULTS: Neuronal loss and pathological changes in the hippocampus sector CA1 and subiculum were observed in 47 of the 302 individuals (16%), and 51% of these changes were bilateral. HS without comorbid neurodegenerative pathology was found in 1/47 subjects with HS (2%). Dementia (p < 0.001) and TDP-43 immunopositivity of the granular cell layer of the dentate fascia (p < 0.001) were strongly associated with HS. The CERAD score, immunopositivity for HPtau and p62 in the granular cell layer of the fascia dentate were also associated. CONCLUSION: HS is prevalent (16%) in the oldest old population, but HS without any comorbid neurodegenerative pathology is rare. The high frequency of unilateral HS (49%) implied that bilateral sampling of hippocampi should be routine practice in neuropathological examination.

29614681|t|Effect of Fluvoxamine on Amyloid-beta Peptide Generation and Memory.
29614681|a|Alzheimer's disease is characterized by abnormal amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide accumulation beginning decades before symptom onset. An effective prophylactic treatment aimed at arresting the amyloidogenic pathway would therefore need to be initiated prior to the occurrence of Abeta pathology. The SIGMAR1 gene encodes a molecular chaperone that modulates processing of the amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP). Fluvoxamine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a potent SIGMAR1 agonist. We therefore hypothesized that fluvoxamine treatment would reduce Abeta production and improve cognition. We firstly investigated the impact of SIGMAR1 on AbetaPP processing, and found that overexpression and knockdown of SIGMAR1 significantly affected gamma-secretase activity in SK-N-MC neuronal cells. We then tested the impact of fluvoxamine on Abeta production in an amyloidogenic cell model, and found that fluvoxamine significantly reduced Abeta production by inhibiting gamma-secretase activity. Finally, we assessed the efficacy of long-term treatment (i.e., ~8 months) of 10 mg/kg/day fluvoxamine in the J20 amyloidogenic mouse model; the treatment was initiated prior to the occurrence of predicted Abeta pathology. Physical examination of the animals revealed no overt pathology or change in weight. We conducted a series of behavioral tests to assess learning and memory, and found that the fluvoxamine treatment significantly improved memory function as measured by novel object recognition task. Two other tests revealed no significant change in memory function. In conclusion, fluvoxamine has a clear impact on gamma-secretase activity and AbetaPP processing to generate Abeta, and may have a protective effect on cognition in the J20 mice.

29615677|t|Longitudinal outcomes of amyloid positive versus negative amnestic mild cognitive impairments: a three-year longitudinal study.
29615677|a|We aimed to compare the longitudinal outcome of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients with significant Pittsburgh Compound B uptake [PiB(+) aMCI] and those without [PiB(-) aMCI]. Cerebral beta-amyloid was measured in 47 patients with aMCI using PiB-positron emission tomography (PET) (31 PiB(+) aMCI and 16 PiB(-) aMCI). Clinical (N = 47) and neuropsychological follow-up (N = 37), and follow-up with brain magnetic resonance imaging (N = 38) and PiB-PET (N = 30) were performed for three years. PiB(+) aMCI had a higher risk of progression to dementia (hazard ratio = 3.74, 95% CI = 1.21-11.58) and faster rate of cortical thinning in the bilateral precuneus and right medial and lateral temporal cortices compared to PiB(-) aMCI. Among six PiB(-) aMCI patients who had regional PiB uptake ratio >1.5 in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), three (50.0%) progressed to dementia, and two of them had global PiB uptake ratio >1.5 at the follow-up PiB-PET. Our findings suggest that amyloid imaging is important for predicting the prognosis of aMCI patients, and that it is necessary to pay more attention to PiB(-) aMCI with increased regional PiB uptake in the PCC.

29617557|t|Computational Analysis for the Rational Design of Anti-Amyloid Beta (Abeta) Antibodies.
29617557|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that lacks effective treatment options. Anti-amyloid beta (Abeta) antibodies are the leading drug candidates to treat AD, but the results of clinical trials have been disappointing. Introducing rational mutations into anti-Abeta antibodies to increase their effectiveness is a way forward, but the path to take is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate the use of computational fragment-based docking and MMPBSA binding free energy calculations in the analysis of anti-Abeta antibodies for rational drug design efforts. Our fragment-based docking method successfully predicts the emergence of the common EFRH epitope. MD simulations coupled with MMPBSA binding free energy calculations are used to analyze scenarios described in prior studies, and we computationally introduce rational mutations into PFA1 to predict mutations that can improve its binding affinity toward the pE3-Abeta3-8 form of Abeta. Two out of our four proposed mutations are predicted to stabilize binding. Our study demonstrates that a computational approach may lead to an improved drug candidate for AD in the future.

29618535|t|Forensic Evaluations for Offenders With Dementia in Taiwan's Criminal Courts.
29618535|a|Dementia is an increasing world-wide health problem, and the association between dementia and adjudication of crimes has rarely been studied. The data in this study are described and analyzed by gender, psychiatric diagnosis, type of crime, and the acceptance rate by the courts of opinions tendered by forensic psychiatric examiners. The source data are derived from the databank of the Judicial Yuan (Judicial Department) of the Republic of China Law and Regulations Retrieval System. There was a male predominance of 85.1 percent. Larceny (42.6%) was the most frequent crime. There was also a high judicial acceptance rate of 91.5 percent of the professional opinions received from forensic psychiatric evaluators who examined defendants at the request of the courts. Psychiatrists play an important role in providing their professional opinions for the Taiwanese courts with regard to adjudication of evaluees with dementia. Most courts accepted psychiatrists' professional opinions about offenders with dementia, and the rate of acceptance was reflected in the judicial rulings of criminal responsibility.

29624402|t|MOMD Analysis of NMR Line Shapes from Abeta-Amyloid Fibrils: A New Tool for Characterizing Molecular Environments in Protein Aggregates.
29624402|a|The microscopic-order-macroscopic-disorder (MOMD) approach for 2H NMR line shape analysis is applied to dry and hydrated 3-fold- and 2-fold-symmetric amyloid-Abeta40 fibrils and protofibrils of the D23N mutant. The methyl moieties of L17, L34, V36 (C-CD3), and M35 (S-CD3) serve as probes. Experimental 2H spectra acquired previously in the 147-310 K range are used. MOMD describes local probe motion as axial diffusion ( R tensor) in the presence of a potential, u, which represents the spatial restrictions exerted by the molecular surroundings. We find that R  = (0.2-3.3) x 104 s-1, R  = (2.2-2.5) x 102 s-1, and R is tilted from the 2H quadrupolar tensor at 60-75 . The strength of u is in the (2.0-2.4) kT range; its rhombicity is substantial. The only methyl moieties affected by fibril hydration are those of M35, located at fibril interfaces. The associated local potentials change form abruptly around 260 K, where massive water freezing occurs. An independent study revealed unfrozen "tightly-peptide-bound" water residing at the interfaces of the 3-fold-symmetric Abeta40 fibrils and at the interfaces of the E22G and E22Delta Abeta40-mutant fibrils. Considering this to be the case in general for Abeta40-related fibrils, the following emerges. The impact of water freezing is transmitted selectively to the fibril structure through interactions with tightly-peptide-bound water, in this case of M35 methyl moieties. The proof that such waters reside at the interfaces of the 2-fold-symmetric fibril, and the protofibril of the D23N mutant, is new. MOMD provides information on the surroundings of the NMR probe directly via the potential, u, which is inherent to the model; a prior interpretation of the same experimental data does so partially and indirectly (see below). Thus, MOMD analysis of NMR line shapes as applied to amyloid fibrils/protein aggregates emerges as a consistent new tool for elucidating the properties of, and processes associated with, molecular environments in the fibril.

29624764|t|Porphyrin Cyclodextrin Conjugates Modulate Amyloid Beta Peptide Aggregation and Cytotoxicity.
29624764|a|Although fibrillar amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) aggregates are one of the major hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, increasing evidence suggests that soluble Abeta oligomers are the primary toxic species. Targeting the oligomeric species could represent an effective strategy to interfere with Abeta toxicity. In this work, the biological properties of 5[4-(6-O-beta-cyclodextrin)-phenyl],10,15,20-tri(4-hydroxyphenyl)-porphyrin and its zinc complex were tested, as new molecules that interact with Abeta and effectively prevent its cytotoxicity. We found that these systems can cross the cell membrane to deliver Abeta intracellularly and promote its clearance. Our results provide evidence for the use of cyclodextrin-porphyrin derivatives as a promising strategy to target amyloid aggregation.

29625119|t|The exosome of adipose-derived stem cells reduces beta-amyloid pathology and apoptosis of neuronal cells derived from the transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
29625119|a|Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC) have a therapeutic potential for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Exosomes are extracellular vesicles secreted from various types of cells, and stem cell-derived exosomes are known to have beneficial effects in many diseases. Many studies have suggested that amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides have a pivotal role in AD progression, by mitochondrial dysfunction of neuronal cells. We examined the therapeutic potential of exosomes derived from ADSCs (ADSC-Exo) in preventing the disease phenotypes induced by the Abeta cascade in an AD in vitro model. Neuronal stem cells (NSCs) from the brains of TG2576 AD mice were used to examine the effects of ADSC-Exo on AD phenotypes. NSCs from AD mice can be grown as a neurosphere and differentiated. Differentiated NSCs of TG2576 mice showed increase of Abeta42 and Abeta40 levels, and Abeta42/40 ratio. Apoptotic molecules such as p53, Bax and caspase-3 were increased and Bcl2, an anti-apoptotic molecule, was decreased in AD cells compared with wild-type littermate cells. Lower viable cell population and higher necrotic cells were examined in AD neuronal cells. ELISA result showed that ADSC-Exo treatment resulted in reduced Abeta42 levels, Abeta40 levels, and the Abeta42/40 ratio of AD cells. Increased apoptotic molecules, p53, Bax, pro-caspase-3 and cleaved-caspase-3, and decreased Bcl-2 protein level were normalized by ADSC-Exo treatment. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that increased cell apoptosis of AD neuronal cells was reduced by ADSC-Exo. In addition, neurite growth, which is impaired by Abeta in the brains of patients with AD, was augmented by ADSC-Exo treatment. Taken together, these findings implicate the disease-modulating effects of ADSC-Exo in the transgenic mice-derived AD in vitro model, and ADSC-Exo can be a therapeutic source to ameliorate the progression of Abeta-induced neuronal death and AD.

29626112|t|Amyloid blood biomarker detects Alzheimer's disease.
29626112|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is currently incurable, but there is general agreement that a minimally invasive blood biomarker for screening in preclinical stages would be crucial for future therapy. Diagnostic tools for detection of AD are either invasive like cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers or expensive such as positron emission tomography (PET) scanning. Here, we determine the secondary structure change of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in human blood. This change used as blood amyloid biomarker indicates prodromal AD and correlates with CSF AD biomarkers and amyloid PET imaging in the cross-sectional BioFINDER cohort. In a further population-based longitudinal cohort (ESTHER), the blood biomarker detected AD several years before clinical diagnosis in baseline samples with a positive likelihood ratio of 7.9; that is, those who were diagnosed with AD over the years were 7.9 times more likely to test positive. This assay may open avenues for blood screening of early AD stages as a funnel for further more invasive and expensive tests.

29626426|t|Plasma phospho-tau181 increases with Alzheimer's disease clinical severity and is associated with tau- and amyloid-positron emission tomography.
29626426|a|INTRODUCTION: We examined and compared plasma phospho-tau181 (pTau181) and total tau: (1) across the Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical spectrum; (2) in relation to brain amyloid beta (Abeta) positron emission tomography (PET), tau PET, and cortical thickness; and (3) as a screening tool for elevated brain Abeta. METHODS: Participants included 172 cognitively unimpaired, 57 mild cognitively impaired, and 40 AD dementia patients with concurrent Abeta PET (Pittsburgh compound B), tau PET (AV1451), magnetic resonance imaging, plasma total tau, and pTau181. RESULTS: Plasma total tau and pTau181 levels were higher in AD dementia patients than those in cognitively unimpaired. Plasma pTau181 was more strongly associated with both Abeta and tau PET. Plasma pTau181 was a more sensitive and specific predictor of elevated brain Abeta than total tau and was as good as, or better than, the combination of age and apolipoprotein E (APOE). DISCUSSION: Plasma pTau181 may have utility as a biomarker of AD pathophysiology and as a noninvasive screener for elevated brain Abeta.

29626601|t|A new purified Lawsoniaside remodels amyloid-beta42 fibrillation into a less toxic and non-amyloidogenic pathway.
29626601|a|Mounting evidence indicates soluble Abeta42 oligomers as the most toxic species causing neuronal death which leads to the onset and progression of Alzheimer disease (AD). Recently, it has been found that neurotoxic Abeta42 oligomers grow from monomeric species or arise following secondary nucleation by preformed mature fibrils. Thus, the use of natural compounds such as polyphenols to hinder the growth or to remodel Abeta42 fibrils is one of the most promising strategies for AD treatment. In our previous study, we showed that 1, 2, 4-trihydroxynaphthalene-2-O-beta-d-glucopyranoside (THNG) inhibits Abeta42 aggregation during the early steps of the aggregation process, inhibits its conformational change to a beta-sheet-rich structure, decreases its polymerization, inhibits its fibrillogenisis and reduces oxidative stress and aggregate cytotoxicity. Here, we used different spectroscopic and cell culture methods to check the effect of THNG on fibrils disaggregation. We showed that THNG binds to mature Abeta42 fibrils, rearrange their secondary structure, and remodels them into non-amyloid, less toxic, species by inhibiting their interaction with the plasma membrane. Our findings reveal that THNG is a good agent to remodel amyloid fibrils and could be used as a starting molecular scaffold to design new anti-AD drugs.

29628304|t|Targeting Amyloid-beta Precursor Protein, APP, Splicing with Antisense Oligonucleotides Reduces Toxic Amyloid-beta Production.
29628304|a|Alterations in amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) have been implicated in cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is accelerated in Down syndrome/Trisomy 21 (DS/TS21), likely due to the extra copy of the APP gene, located on chromosome 21. Proteolytic cleavage of APP generates amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide, the primary component of senile plaques associated with AD. Reducing Abeta production is predicted to lower plaque burden and mitigate AD symptoms. Here, we designed a splice-switching antisense oligonucleotide (SSO) that causes skipping of the APP exon that encodes proteolytic cleavage sites required for Abeta peptide production. The SSO induced exon skipping in Down syndrome cell lines, resulting in a reduction of Abeta. Treatment of mice with the SSO resulted in widespread distribution in the brain accompanied by APP exon skipping and a reduction of Abeta. Overall, we show that an alternatively spliced isoform of APP encodes a cleavage-incompetent protein that does not produce Abeta peptide and that promoting the production of this isoform with an SSO can reduce Abeta in vivo. These findings demonstrate the utility of using SSOs to induce a spliced isoform of APP to reduce Abeta as a potential approach for treating AD.

29630553|t|Heparin Modulates the Kinetics of Zinc-Induced Aggregation of Amyloid-beta Peptides.
29630553|a|Zinc-induced aggregation of amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) is considered to contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. While glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) that are commonly present in interneuronal space are known to enhance Abeta self-aggregation in vitro, the impact of GAGs on the formation of zinc-induced amorphous Abeta aggregates has not yet been thoroughly studied. Here, employing dynamic light scattering, bis-ANS fluorimetry, and sedimentation assays, we demonstrate that heparin serving as a representative GAG modulates the kinetics of zinc-induced Abeta42 aggregation in vitro by slowing the rate of aggregate formation and aggregate size growth. By using synthetic Abeta16 peptides to model the Abeta metal-binding domain (MBD), heparin was found to effectively interact with MBDs in complex with zinc ions. We suggest that heparin adsorbs to the surface of growing zinc-induced Abeta42 aggregates via electrostatic interactions, thus creating a steric hindrance that inhibits further inclusion of monomeric and/or oligomeric zinc-Abeta42 complexes. Furthermore, the adsorbed heparin can interfere with the zinc-bridging mechanism of Abeta42 aggregation, requiring the formation of two zinc-mediated interaction interfaces in the MBD. As revealed by computer simulations of the zinc-Abeta16 homodimer complexed with a heparin chain, heparin can interact with the MBD via polar contacts with residues Arg-5 and Tyr-10, resulting in a conformational rearrangement that hampers the formation of the second zinc-mediated interaction in the MBD interface. The findings of this study suggest that GAGs, which are common in the in vivo macromolecular environment, may have a substantial impact on the time course of zinc-induced Abeta aggregation.

29630554|t|Association of Plasma Neurofilament Light Chain with Neocortical Amyloid-beta Load and Cognitive Performance in Cognitively Normal Elderly Participants.
29630554|a|BACKGROUND: The disruption of neurofilament, an axonal cytoskeletal protein, in neurodegenerative conditions may result in neuronal damage and its release into the cerebrospinal fluid and blood. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), neurofilament light chain (NFL), a neurofilament subunit, is elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid and blood. OBJECTIVE: Investigate the association of plasma NFL with preclinical-AD features, such as high neocortical amyloid-beta load (NAL) and subjective memory complaints, and cognitive performance in cognitively normal older adults. METHODS: Plasma NFL concentrations were measured employing the single molecule array platform in participants from the Kerr Anglican Retirement Village Initiative in Ageing Health cohort, aged 65- 90 years. Participants underwent a battery of neuropsychological testing to evaluate cognitive performance and were categorized as low NAL (NAL-, n = 65) and high NAL (NAL+, n = 35) assessed via PET, and further stratified into subjective memory complainers (SMC; nNAL- = 51, nNAL+ = 25) and non-SMC (nNAL- = 14, nNAL+ = 10) based on the Memory Assessment Clinic- Questionnaire. RESULTS: Plasma NFL inversely correlated with cognitive performance. No significant difference in NFL was observed between NAL+ and NAL- participants; however, within APOEe4 non-carriers, higher NAL was observed in individuals with NFL concentrations within quartiles 3 and 4 (versus quartile 1). Additionally, within the NAL+ participants, SMC had a trend of higher NFL compared to non-SMC. CONCLUSION: Plasma NFL is inversely associated with cognitive performance in elderly individuals. While plasma NFL may not reflect NAL in individuals with normal global cognition, the current observations indicate that onset of axonal injury, reflected by increased plasma NFL, within the preclinical phase of AD may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD.

29630865|t|Doublecortin expression in CD8+ T-cells and microglia at sites of amyloid-beta plaques: A potential role in shaping plaque pathology?
29630865|a|INTRODUCTION: One characteristic of Alzheimer's disease is the formation of amyloid-beta plaques, which are typically linked to neuroinflammation and surrounded by inflammatory cells such as microglia and infiltrating immune cells. METHODS: Here, we describe nonneurogenic doublecortin (DCX) positive cells, DCX being generally used as a marker for young immature neurons, at sites of amyloid-beta plaques in various transgenic amyloid mouse models and in human brains with plaque pathology. RESULTS: The plaque-associated DCX+ cells were not of neurogenic identity, instead most of them showed coexpression with markers for microglia (ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1) and for phagocytosis (CD68 and TREM2). Another subpopulation of plaque-associated DCX+ cells was negative for ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 but was highly positive for the pan-leukocyte marker CD45. These hematopoietic cells were identified as CD3-and CD8-positive and CD4-negative T-cells. DISCUSSION: Peculiarly, the DCX+/ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1+ microglia and DCX+/CD8+ T-cells were closely attached, suggesting that these two cell types are tightly interacting and that this interaction might shape plaque pathology.

29632177|t|beta-Amyloid accumulation in the human brain after one night of sleep deprivation.
29632177|a|The effects of acute sleep deprivation on beta-amyloid (Abeta) clearance in the human brain have not been documented. Here we used PET and 18F-florbetaben to measure brain Abeta burden (ABB) in 20 healthy controls tested after a night of rested sleep (baseline) and after a night of sleep deprivation. We show that one night of sleep deprivation, relative to baseline, resulted in a significant increase in Abeta burden in the right hippocampus and thalamus. These increases were associated with mood worsening following sleep deprivation, but were not related to the genetic risk (APOE genotype) for Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, baseline ABB in a range of subcortical regions and the precuneus was inversely associated with reported night sleep hours. APOE genotyping was also linked to subcortical ABB, suggesting that different Alzheimer's disease risk factors might independently affect ABB in nearby brain regions. In summary, our findings show adverse effects of one-night sleep deprivation on brain ABB and expand on prior findings of higher Abeta accumulation with chronic less sleep.

29632371|t|Gain of toxic apolipoprotein E4 effects in human iPSC-derived neurons is ameliorated by a small-molecule structure corrector.
29632371|a|Efforts to develop drugs for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have shown promise in animal studies, only to fail in human trials, suggesting a pressing need to study AD in human model systems. Using human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells that expressed apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4), a variant of the APOE gene product and the major genetic risk factor for AD, we demonstrated that ApoE4-expressing neurons had higher levels of tau phosphorylation, unrelated to their increased production of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides, and that they displayed GABAergic neuron degeneration. ApoE4 increased Abeta production in human, but not in mouse, neurons. Converting ApoE4 to ApoE3 by gene editing rescued these phenotypes, indicating the specific effects of ApoE4. Neurons that lacked APOE behaved similarly to those expressing ApoE3, and the introduction of ApoE4 expression recapitulated the pathological phenotypes, suggesting a gain of toxic effects from ApoE4. Treatment of ApoE4-expressing neurons with a small-molecule structure corrector ameliorated the detrimental effects, thus showing that correcting the pathogenic conformation of ApoE4 is a viable therapeutic approach for ApoE4-related AD.

29637287|t|The effect of chronic stimulation of serotonin receptor type 7 on recognition, passive avoidance memory, hippocampal long-term potentiation, and neuronal apoptosis in the amyloid beta protein treated rat.
29637287|a|RATIONALE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory impairment, neuronal death, and synaptic loss in the hippocampus. Long-term potentiation (LTP), a type of synaptic plasticity, occurs during learning and memory. Serotonin receptor type 7 (5-HTR7) activation is suggested as a possible therapeutic target for AD. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of chronic treatment with the 5-HTR7 agonist, AS19, on cognitive function, memory, hippocampal plasticity, amyloid beta (Abeta) plaque accumulation, and apoptosis in an adult rat model of AD. METHODS: AD was induced in rats using Abeta (single 1 mug/muL intracerebroventricular (icv) injection during surgery). The following experimental groups were included: control, sham-operated, Abeta + saline (1 muL icv for 30 days), and Abeta + AS19 (1 mug/muL icv for 30 days) groups. The animals were tested for cognition and memory performance using the novel object recognition and passive avoidance tests, respectively. Next, anesthetized rats were placed in a stereotaxic apparatus for electrode implantation, and field potentials were recorded in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Lastly, brains were removed and Abeta plaques and neuronal apoptosis were evaluated using Congo red staining and TUNEL assay, respectively. RESULTS: Administration of AS19 in the Abeta rats increased the discrimination index of the novel object recognition test. Furthermore, AS19 treatment decreased time spent in the dark compartment during the passive avoidance test. AS19 also enhanced both the population spike (PS) amplitude and the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) slope evoked potentials of the LTP components. Abeta plaques and neuronal apoptosis were decreased in the AS19-treated Abeta rats. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that chronic treatment with a 5-HTR7 agonist can prevent Abeta-related impairments in cognition and memory performance by alleviating Abeta plaque accumulation and neuronal apoptosis, hence improving neuronal plasticity. AS19 may be useful as a therapeutic agent for AD.

29645399|t|Amyloid-beta Peptide Induces Prion Protein Amyloid Formation: Evidence for Its Widespread Amyloidogenic Effect.
29645399|a|Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy is associated with misfolding of prion protein (PrP) into an amyloid beta-rich aggregate. Previous studies have indicated that PrP interacts with Alzheimer's disease amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), but it remains elusive how this interaction impacts on the misfolding of PrP. This study presents the first in vitro evidence that Abeta induces PrP-amyloid formation at submicromolar concentrations. Interestingly, systematic mutagenesis of PrP revealed that Abeta requires no specific amino acid sequences in PrP, and induces the misfolding of other unrelated proteins (insulin and lysozyme) into amyloid fibrils in a manner analogous to PrP. This unanticipated nonspecific amyloidogenic effect of Abeta indicates that this peptide might be involved in widespread protein aggregation, regardless of the amino acid sequences of target proteins, and exacerbate the pathology of many neurodegenerative diseases.

29648815|t|Peptidomimetic-Based Multidomain Targeting Offers Critical Evaluation of Abeta Structure and Toxic Function.
29648815|a|The prevailing hypothesis stipulates that the preamyloid oligomers of Abeta are the main culprits associated with the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which has prompted efforts to search for therapeutic agents with the ability to inhibit Abeta oligomerization and amyloidogenesis. However, clinical progress is impeded by the limited structural information about the neurotoxic oligomers. To address this issue, we have adopted a synthetic approach, where a library of oligopyridylamide-based small molecules was tested against various microscopic events implicated in the self-assembly of Abeta. Two oligopyridylamides bind to different domains of Abeta and affect distinct microscopic events in Abeta self-assembly. The study lays the foundations for a dual recognition strategy to simultaneously target different domains of Abeta for further improvement in antiamyloidogenic activity. The data demonstrate that one of the most effective oligopyridylamides forms a high affinity complex with Abeta, which sustains the compound's activity in cellular milieu. The oligopyridylamide was able to rescue cells when introduced 24 h after the incubation of Abeta. The rescue of Abeta toxicity is potentially a consequence of the colocalization of the oligopyridylamide with Abeta. The synthetic tools utilized here provide a straightforward strategic framework to identify a range of potent antagonists of Abeta-mediated toxic functions. This approach could be a powerful route to the design of candidate drugs for various amyloid diseases that have so far proven to be "untargetable".

29653407|t|A new Alzheimer's disease cell model using B cells to induce beta amyloid plaque formation and increase TNF alpha expression.
29653407|a|Different cell models have been developed for the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathways. The neuronal dysfunction and cell death mechanisms that are commonly found in this disease are due to the production of high levels of cytokines and the formation of amyloid plaques. In the cell model introduced in the present study, the production of these two important factors is induced by using B cells from an AD patient. The B cells of an Alzheimer's patient and a normal control were immortalized by using EBV (Epstein-Barr virus) to produce a lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL). The amount of TNF alpha cytokine was evaluated at the RNA and protein levels by RT-PCR and ELISA, respectively. The AD LCL was cultured with SKNMC cells with and without treatment of TNF alpha siRNA. Amyloid plaque formation was monitored by Congo-red staining and microscopy. The amount of TNF alpha cytokine was significantly increased in the AD LCL compared to the normal LCL. The AD LCL induced the formation of amyloid plaques in SKNMC cells. The AD LCL treated with TNF alpha siRNA and co-cultured with SKNMC cells decreased the size and number of amyloid plaques in SKNMC cells. This cellular model is an appropriate model for studying Alzheimer's disease and the mechanisms related to it, as well as for research on cytokine inhibitors, especially TNF alpha inhibitors.

29653987|t|Prevalence of preclinical Alzheimer disease: Comparison of current classification systems.
29653987|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of preclinical Alzheimer disease (AD) according to current classification systems by examining CSF from a representative general population sample of 70-year-olds from Gothenburg, Sweden. METHOD: The sample was derived from the population-based H70 Gothenburg Birth Cohort Studies in Gothenburg, Sweden. The participants (n = 322, age 70 years) underwent comprehensive neuropsychiatric, cognitive, and somatic examinations. CSF levels of beta-amyloid (Abeta)42, Abeta40, total tau, and phosphorylated tau were measured. Preclinical AD was classified according to criteria of the A/T/N system, Dubois 2016, National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) criteria, and International Working Group-2 (IWG-2) criteria. Individuals with Clinical Dementia Rating score >0 were excluded, leaving 259 cognitively unimpaired individuals. RESULTS: The prevalence of amyloid pathology was 22.8%, of total tau pathology was 33.2%, and of phosphorylated tau pathology was 6.9%. With the A/T/N system, the prevalence of A+/T-/N- was 13.1%, A+/T-/N+ was 7.3%, A+/T+/N+ was 2.3%, A-/T-/N+ was 18.9%, and A-/T+/N+ was 4.6%. When the Dubois criteria were applied, the prevalence of asymptomatic at risk for AD was 36.7% and of preclinical AD was 9.7%. With the NIA-AA criteria, the prevalence of stage 1 was 13.1% and stage 2 was 9.7%. With the IWG-2 criteria, the prevalence of asymptomatic at risk for AD was 9.7%. The APOE epsilon4 allele was associated with several of the categories. Men more often had total tau pathology, A+/T-/N+, preclinical AD according to Dubois 2016, asymptomatic at risk for AD according to the IWG-2 criteria, and NIA-AA stage 2. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of pathologic AD markers was very common (46%) in a representative population sample of 70-year-olds. The clinical implications of these findings need to be scrutinized further in longitudinal studies.

29654761|t|Particulate matter increases beta-amyloid and activated glial cells in hippocampal tissues of transgenic Alzheimer's mouse: Involvement of PARP-1.
29654761|a|Exposure to air pollutants, such as particulate matter (PM), has been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, direct effects of PM on production of beta-amyloid (Abeta), a key pathogenic molecule in AD, and its underlying mechanism are still elusive. Given PM's potential to induce oxidative stress in other tissues, we hypothesized that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP-1) might be involved in PM-induced neurotoxicity. To address this, we used an ex vivo model of AD, the organotypic hippocampal slice tissue culture from old (12-14 months-of-age) triple transgenic 3xTg-AD mice. First, we observed that fine PM (aerodynamic diameter < 4 mum) can dose-dependently activate PARP-1 and decrease NAD+ levels in Neuro2A cells. PARP-1 activation did occur under concentrations of PM which did not affect cell viability. Next, we observed that direct treatment of PM increased Abeta levels and activated glial cells in the ex vivo hippocampal tissues of 3xTg-AD mice. PM-induced glial activation was most prominent in CA1 region of the hippocampal tissue. Notably, we found that pharmacological inhibition of PARP-1 reversed both PM-induced Abeta increase and glial activation, arguing the possible involvement of PARP-1 in PM-induced AD pathogenesis. Our findings suggest that PARP-1 might be a potential molecular target, responsible for mediating negative effects of PM on the brain. Modulating PARP-1 activity could be a promising approach to prevent or alleviate PM-related environmental neurotoxicity which could initiate AD pathogenesis.

29655652|t|Protective role of rosmarinic acid on amyloid beta 42-induced echoic memory decline: Implication of oxidative stress and cholinergic impairment.
29655652|a|In the present study, we examined whether rosmarinic acid (RA) reverses amyloid beta (Abeta) induced reductions in antioxidant defense, lipid peroxidation, cholinergic damage as well as the central auditory deficits. For this purpose, Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups; Sham(S), Sham + RA (SR), Abeta42 peptide (Abeta) and Abeta42 peptide + RA (AbetaR) groups. Rat model of Alzheimer was established by bilateral injection of Abeta42 peptide (2,2 nmol/10 mul) into the lateral ventricles. RA (50 mg/kg, daily) was administered orally by gavage for 14 days after intracerebroventricular injection. At the end of the experimental period, we recorded the auditory event related potentials (AERPs) and mismatch negativity (MMN) response to assess auditory functions followed by histological and biochemical analysis. Abeta42 injection led to a significant increase in the levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and 4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) but decreased the activity of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, GSH-Px) and glutathione levels. Moreover, Abeta42 injection resulted in a reduction in the acetylcholine content and acetylcholine esterase activity. RA treatment prevented the observed alterations in the AbetaR group. Furthermore, RA attenuated the increased Abeta staining and astrocyte activation. We also found that Abeta42 injection decreased the MMN response and theta power/coherence of AERPs, suggesting an impairing effect on auditory discrimination and echoic memory processes. RA treatment reversed the Abeta42 related alterations in AERP parameters. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that RA prevented Abeta-induced antioxidant-oxidant imbalance and cholinergic damage, which may contribute to the improvement of neural network dynamics of auditory processes in this rat model.

29657084|t|Aggregated Abeta1-42 Is Selectively Toxic for Neurons, Whereas Glial Cells Produce Mature Fibrils with Low Toxicity in Drosophila.
29657084|a|The basis for selective vulnerability of certain cell types for misfolded proteins (MPs) in neurodegenerative diseases is largely unknown. This knowledge is crucial for understanding disease progression in relation to MPs spreading in the CNS. We assessed this issue in Drosophila by cell-specific expression of human Abeta1-42 associated with Alzheimer's disease. Expression of Abeta1-42 in various neurons resulted in concentration-dependent severe neurodegenerative phenotypes, and intraneuronal ring-tangle-like aggregates with immature fibril properties when analyzed by aggregate-specific ligands. Unexpectedly, expression of Abeta1-42 from a pan-glial driver produced a mild phenotype despite massive brain load of Abeta1-42 aggregates, even higher than in the strongest neuronal driver. Glial cells formed more mature fibrous aggregates, morphologically distinct from aggregates found in neurons, and was mainly extracellular. Our findings implicate that Abeta1-42 cytotoxicity is both cell and aggregate morphotype dependent.

29660838|t|TDP-43 pathology in multiple system atrophy: colocalization of TDP-43 and alpha-synuclein in glial cytoplasmic inclusions.
29660838|a|AIMS: This study aimed to assess clinicopathologic features of transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) pathology and its risk factors in multiple system atrophy (MSA). METHODS: Paraffin-embedded sections of the amygdala and basal forebrain from 186 autopsy-confirmed MSA cases were screened with immunohistochemistry for phospho-TDP-43. In cases having TDP-43 pathology, additional brain regions were assessed. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence double-staining and immunogold electron microscopy (IEM) were performed to evaluate colocalization of TDP-43 and alpha-synuclein. Genetic risk factors for TDP-43 pathology were also analysed. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry showed various morphologies of TDP-43 pathology in 13 cases (7%), such as subpial astrocytic inclusions, neuronal inclusions, dystrophic neurites, perivascular inclusions and glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs). Multivariable logistic regression models revealed that only advanced age, but not concurrent Alzheimer's disease, argyrophilic grain disease or hippocampal sclerosis, was an independent risk factor for TDP-43 pathology in MSA (OR: 1.11, 95% CI: 1.04-1.19, P = 0.002). TDP-43 pathology was restricted to the amygdala in eight cases and extended to the hippocampus in two cases. The remaining three cases had widespread TDP-43 pathology. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence double-staining and IEM revealed colocalization of alpha-synuclein and TDP-43 in GCIs with granule-coated filaments. Pilot genetic studies failed to show associations between risk variants of TMEM106B or GRN and TDP-43 pathology. CONCLUSIONS: TDP-43 pathology is rare in MSA and occurs mainly in the medial temporal lobe. Advanced age is a risk factor for TDP-43 pathology in MSA. Colocalization of TDP-43 and alpha-synuclein in GCIs suggests possible direct interaction between the two molecules.

29660932|t|Neuroprotective Effects of Ferruginol, Jatrophone, and Junicedric Acid Against Amyloid-beta Injury in Hippocampal Neurons.
29660932|a|Soluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers have been recognized as early neurotoxic intermediates with a key role in the synaptic dysfunction observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta oligomers block hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and impair rodent spatial memory. Additionally, the presence of Abeta oligomers is associated with imbalanced intracellular calcium levels and apoptosis in neurons. In this context, we evaluated the effects of three diterpenes (ferruginol, jatrophone, and junicedric acid) that are found in medicinal plants and have several forms of biological activity. The intracellular calcium levels in hippocampal neurons increased in the presence of ferruginol, jatrophone, and junicedric acid, a result that was consistent with the observed increase in CA1 synaptic transmission in mouse hippocampal slices. Additionally, assays using Abeta peptide demonstrated that diterpenes, particularly ferruginol, restore LTP and reduce apoptosis. Recovery of the Abeta oligomer-induced loss of the synaptic proteins PSD-95, synapsin, VGlut, and NMDA receptor subunit 2A was observed in mouse hippocampal slices treated with junicedric acid. This cascade of events may be associated with the regulation of kinases, e.g., protein kinase C (PKC) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), in addition to the activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and could thus provide protection against Abeta oligomers, which trigger synaptic dysfunction. Our results suggest a potential neuroprotective role for diterpenes against the Abeta oligomers-induced neurodegenerative alterations, which make them interesting molecules to be further studied in the context of AD.

29660945|t|TRPC1 Null Exacerbates Memory Deficit and Apoptosis Induced by Amyloid-beta.
29660945|a|The transient receptor potential cation (TRPC) channels are widely expressed in nervous system but their functions remain largely unclear. Here, we found that TRPC1 deletion did not affect learning and memory in physiological conditions, while it aggravated learning and memory deficits induced by amyloid-beta (Abeta), the major component of the senile plaques observed in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Further studies demonstrated that TRPC1 deletion did not affect cell apoptosis in physiological condition, but it exacerbated the Abeta-induced cell death in mouse hippocampus. Moreover, the level of TRPC1 was decreased in AD cell and mouse models, and upregulation of TRPC1 decreased Abeta levels with attenuation of apoptosis in the cells stably overexpressing amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP). Finally, the transmembrane domain of TRPC1 could bind to AbetaPP and thus decreased Abeta production. These findings indicate that loss of TRPC1 exacerbates Abeta-induced memory deficit and cell apoptosis, though it does not impair cognitive function or induce cell death in physiological conditions.

29668283|t|Modulation of the Formation of Abeta- and Sup35NM-Based Amyloids by Complex Interplay of Specific and Nonspecific Ion Effects.
29668283|a|In vitro formation of highly ordered protein aggregates, amyloids, is influenced by the presence of ions. Here, we have studied the effect of anions on amyloid fibril formation by two different amyloidogenic proteins, human amyloid beta-42 (Abeta42), associated with Alzheimer disease and produced recombinantly with an N-terminal methionine (Met-Abeta42), and histidine-tagged NM fragment of Sup35 protein (Sup35NM-His6), a yeast release factor controlling protein-based inheritance, at pH values above and below their isoelectric points. We demonstrate here that pH plays a critical role in determining the effect of ions on the aggregation of Met-Abeta42 and Sup35NM-His6. Further, the electrophoretic mobilities of Met-Abeta42 and Sup35NM-His6 were measured in the presence of different anions at pH above and below the isoelectric points to understand how anions interact with these proteins when they bear a net positive or negative charge. We find that although ion-protein interactions generally follow expectations based on the anion positions within the Hofmeister series, there are qualitative differences in the aggregation behavior of Met-Abeta42 and Sup35NM-His6. These differences arise from a competition between nonspecific charge neutralization and screening effects and specific ion adsorption and can be explained by the different biochemical and biophysical properties of Met-Abeta42 and Sup35NM-His6.

29668503|t|Tetrahydroxystilbene glycoside antagonizes beta-amyloid-induced inflammatory injury in microglia cells by regulating PU.1 expression.
29668503|a|Inhibiting beta-amyloid (Abeta)-induced microglial activation is proposed as an effective strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Tetrahydroxystilbene glycoside (TSG) is the main active ingredient of Polygonum multiflorum and has a wide range of biological properties, including antiinflammation. Here, we focused on the function and regulatory mechanism of TSG in Abeta-induced N9 and BV2 cells. The results showed that Abeta treatment induced the activation of microglia cells and the production of inflammatory molecules, including inducible nitric oxide synthase, nitric oxide, cyclooxygenase 2, and prostaglandin E2, which were significantly inhibited by TSG pretreatment. Furthermore, we found Abeta exposure increased the levels of microglial M1 markers, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha, and the pretreatment of TSG suppressed the increase of M1 markers and enhanced the levels of M2 markers, including IL-10, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor, and arginase-1. PU.1 overexpression was found to eradicate the anti-inflammatory effects of TSG in Abeta-induced microglial cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that TSG attenuates Abeta-induced microglial activation and polarizes microglia towards M2 phenotype, which may be closely associated with the regulation of PU.1.

29671417|t|Cyanidin attenuates Abeta25-35-induced neuroinflammation by suppressing NF-kappaB activity downstream of TLR4/NOX4 in human neuroblastoma cells.
29671417|a|Cyanidin is polyphenolic pigment found in plants. We have previously demonstrated that cyanidin protects nerve cells against Abeta25-35-induced toxicity by decreasing oxidative stress and attenuating apoptosis mediated by both the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and the ER stress pathway. To further elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of cyanidin, we investigated the effects of cyanidin on neuroinflammation mediated by the TLR4/NOX4 pathway in Abeta25-35-treated human neuroblastoma cell line (SK-N-SH). SK-N-SH cells were exposed to Abeta25-35 (10 mumol/L) for 24 h. Pretreatment with cyanidin (20 mumol/L) or NAC (20 mumol/L) strongly inhibited the NF-kappaB signaling pathway in the cells evidenced by suppressing the degradation of IkappaBalpha, translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, and thereby reducing the expression of iNOS protein and the production of NO. Furthermore, pretreatment with cyanidin greatly promoted the translocation of the Nrf2 protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleus; upregulating cytoprotective enzymes, including HO-1, NQO-1 and GCLC; and increased the activity of SOD enzymes. Pretreatment with cyanidin also decreased the expression of TLR4, directly improved intracellular ROS levels and regulated the activity of inflammation-related downstream pathways including NO production and SOD activity through TLR4/NOX4 signaling. These results demonstrate that TLR4 is a primary receptor in SK-N-SH cells, by which Abeta25-35 triggers neuroinflammation, and cyanidin attenuates Abeta-induced inflammation and ROS production mediated by the TLR4/NOX4 pathway, suggesting that inhibition of TLR4 by cyanidin could be beneficial in preventing neuronal cell death in the process of Alzheimer's disease.

29672446|t|The effects of treadmill exercise on autophagy in hippocampus of APP/PS1 transgenic mice.
29672446|a|The beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition is one of the major pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Dysfunction in autophagy has been reported to lead to the Abeta deposition. The current study aimed to investigate the effects of treadmill exercise on autophagy activity and the Abeta deposition and to demonstrate whether exercise-induced reduction in the Abeta deposition was associated with changes in autophagy activity. APP/PS1 transgenic mice were divided into transgenic sedentary (TG-SED, n=12) and transgenic exercise (TG-EXE, n=12) groups. Wild-type mice were also divided into sedentary (WT-SED, n=12) and exercise (WT-EXE, n=12) groups. The WT-EXE and TG-EXE mice were subjected to treadmill exercise for 12 weeks. The levels of Abeta plaques and soluble forms of Abeta, autophagy markers light chain 3 and P62, and lysosomal marker lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (Lamp1) were measured in the hippocampus. Both Abeta plaques and soluble forms of Abeta (Abeta40 and Abeta42) were significantly increased in TG-SED mice compared with WT-SED mice, whereas exercise reduced Abeta deposition in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Coincidentally, TG-SED mice displayed a decrease in autophagy activity as evidenced by a significant increase in the levels of light chain 3-II and P62, as well as an accumulation of lysosome as evidenced by a significant over-expression of Lamp1. Interestingly, exercise increased autophagy activity as evidenced by a significant reduction in the levels of P62 and Lamp1 in TG-EXE mice. These findings suggest that treadmill exercise is efficient in decreasing Abeta deposition by enhancing autophagy-lysosomal activity in APP/PS1 transgenic mice, demonstrating a possible approach in Alzheimer's disease prevention and treatment.

29673150|t|Immunohistochemical Evidence from APP-Transgenic Mice for Glutaminyl Cyclase as Drug Target to Diminish pE-Abeta Formation.
29673150|a|Oligomeric assemblies of neurotoxic amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides generated by proteolytical processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) play a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In recent years, a substantial heterogeneity of Abeta peptides with distinct biophysical and cell biological properties has been demonstrated. Among these, a particularly neurotoxic and disease-specific Abeta variant is N-terminally truncated and modified to pyroglutamate (pE-Abeta). Cell biological and animal experimental studies imply the catalysis of this modification by the enzyme glutaminyl cyclase (QC). However, direct histopathological evidence in transgenic animals from comparative brain region and cell type-specific expression of transgenic hAPP and QC, on the one hand, and on the formation of pE-Abeta aggregates, on the other, is lacking. Here, using single light microscopic, as well as triple immunofluorescent, labeling, we report the deposition of pE-Abeta only in the brain regions of APP-transgenic Tg2576 mice with detectable human APP and endogenous QC expression, such as the hippocampus, piriform cortex, and amygdala. Brain regions showing human APP expression without the concomitant presence of QC (the anterodorsal thalamic nucleus and perifornical nucleus) do not display pE-Abeta plaque formation. However, we also identified brain regions with substantial expression of human APP and QC in the absence of pE-Abeta deposition (the Edinger-Westphal nucleus and locus coeruleus). In these brain regions, the enzymes required to generate N-truncated Abeta peptides as substrates for QC might be lacking. Our observations provide additional evidence for an involvement of QC in AD pathogenesis via QC-catalyzed pE-Abeta formation.

29678572|t|Sildenafil protects neuronal cells from mitochondrial toxicity induced by beta-amyloid peptide via ATP-sensitive K+ channels.
29678572|a|To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of sildenafil in animal models of neurological disorders, we investigated the effects of sildenafil on the mitochondrial toxicity induced by beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide. Treatment of HT-22 hippocampal neuronal cells with Abeta25~35 results in increased mitochondrial Ca2+ load, which is subsequently suppressed by sildenafil as well as by diazoxide, a selective opener of the ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP). However, the suppressive effects of sildenafil and diazoxide are significantly attenuated by 5-hydroxydecanoic acid (5-HD), a KATP inhibitor. The increased mitochondrial Ca2+ overload is accompanied by decrease in the intracellular ATP concentration, increase in intracellular ROS generation, occurrence of mitochondrial permeability transition, and activation of caspase-9 and cell death. Exposure to sildenafil inhibited the mitochondria-associated changes and cell death induced by Abeta. However, the inhibitory effects of sildenafil are abolished or weakened in the presence of 5-HD, suggesting that opening of the mitochondrial KATP is required for sildenafil to exert these effects. Taken together, these results indicate that at the mitochondrial levels, sildenafil plays a protective role towards neuronal cell in an environment rich in Abeta, and exerts its effects via the mitochondrial KATP channels-dependent mechanisms.

29678763|t|Construction of Quenchbodies to detect and image amyloid beta oligomers.
29678763|a|A quenchbody (Q-body) is an antibody-based biosensor that employs fluorescence quenching of the dye(s) attached to the antibody fragment, which are de-quenched upon antigen binding. In this study, we aimed to develop Fab type Q-bodies (UQ-bodies) to aid the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Characteristic senile plaques in AD consist of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) generated from the amyloid precursor protein. Abeta42, one of the major peptide forms, aggregates fast and manifests higher neurotoxicity. Recent studies showed that Abeta oligomers, such as Abeta-derived diffusible ligand (ADDL), are more toxic than fibrils. Thus, detection of Abeta and its oligomers in body fluid might help detect deterioration caused by the disease. To this end, the Fab fragment of the anti-Abeta antibody h12A11, which binds preferentially to ADDL, was expressed in Escherichia coli, and labeled with a fluorescent dye at the N terminus of either the heavy chain, or the heavy and light chains, via Cys-containing tag(s) to prepare UQ-bodies. As a result, the double-labeled UQ-bodies detected ADDL with higher sensitivity than that for the Abeta peptide. In addition, the UQ-body could be used to image aggregated Abeta with a low background, which suggested the potential of UQ-bodies as a fast bioimaging tool.

29679576|t|Quantitative appraisal of the Amyloid Imaging Taskforce appropriate use criteria for amyloid-PET.
29679576|a|INTRODUCTION: We test the hypothesis that amyloid-positron emission tomography prescriptions, considered appropriate based on the Amyloid Imaging Taskforce (AIT) criteria, lead to greater clinical utility than AIT-inappropriate prescriptions. METHODS: We compared the clinical utility between patients who underwent amyloid-positron emission tomography appropriately or inappropriately and among the subgroups of patients defined by the AIT criteria. Finally, we performed logistic regressions to identify variables associated with clinical utility. RESULTS: We identified 171 AIT-appropriate and 67 AIT-inappropriate patients. AIT-appropriate and AIT-inappropriate cases did not differ in any outcomes of clinical utility (P > .05). Subgroup analysis denoted both expected and unexpected results. The logistic regressions outlined the primary role of clinical picture and clinical or neuropsychological profile in identifying patients benefitting from amyloid-positron emission tomography. DISCUSSION: Contrary to our hypothesis, also AIT-inappropriate prescriptions were associated with clinical utility. Clinical or neuropsychological variables, not taken into account by the AIT criteria, may help further refine criteria for appropriateness.

29679649|t|Protein-solvent interfaces in human Y145Stop prion protein amyloid fibrils probed by paramagnetic solid-state NMR spectroscopy.
29679649|a|The C-terminally truncated Y145Stop variant of prion protein (PrP23-144), which is associated with heritable PrP cerebral amyloid angiopathy in humans and also capable of triggering a transmissible prion disease in mice, serves as a useful in vitro model for investigating the molecular and structural basis of amyloid strains and cross-seeding specificities. Here, we determine the protein-solvent interfaces in human PrP23-144 amyloid fibrils generated from recombinant 13C,15N-enriched protein and incubated in aqueous solution containing paramagnetic Cu(II)-EDTA, by measuring residue-specific 15N longitudinal paramagnetic relaxation enhancements using two-dimensional magic-angle spinning solid-state NMR spectroscopy. To further probe the interactions of the amyloid core residues with solvent molecules we perform complementary measurements of amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange detected by solid-state NMR and solution NMR methods. The solvent accessibility data are evaluated in the context of the structural model for human PrP23-144 amyloid.

29680859|t|Age-Related Increase of Insulin-Degrading Enzyme Is Inversely Correlated with Cognitive Function in APPswe/PS1dE9 Mice.
29680859|a|BACKGROUND Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) is an important regulator for Ab clearance and diabetes. Although it is indispensable in removing plaques related to onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in degrading insulin related to diabetes, there have been few studies on the dynamic level of IDE in different stages of AD. MATERIAL AND METHODS The present study explored the level IDE protein in different stages of APPswe/PS1dE9 mice and their correlations with cognitive decline. The 4-month-old, 10-month-old, and 18-month-old mice were used as the different age stages of mice. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Morris water maze test. We also observed the level of Ab plaques in brain regions of different stages. RESULTS The data revealed that the expression of IDE was dramatically higher than in age-matched wild mice at the age of 10 months and 18 months. In terms of distribution, Abeta plaques were deposited mostly in the cortex and hippocampus, especially in 10-month-old and 18-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. The cognitive function of 4-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 mice was not significantly differ in spatial learning. However, the cognitive function, both spatial learning and spatial memory, was dramatically lower in 10-month-old and 18-month-old groups. CONCLUSIONS There was a positive correlation between the expression of IDE and spatial memory in 10-month-old and 18-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. The study of this protein may provide reference values for the further study of IDE in Alzheimer's disease.

29681782|t|Early Detection of Abeta Deposition in the 5xFAD Mouse by Amyloid PET.
29681782|a|Purpose.18F-FC119S is a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer for imaging beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of 18F-FC119S in quantitating Abeta deposition in a mouse model of early amyloid deposition (5xFAD) by PET. Method. Dynamic 18F-FC119S PET images were obtained in 5xFAD (n = 5) and wild-type (WT) mice (n = 7). The brain PET images were spatially normalized to the M. Mirrione T2-weighted mouse brain MR template, and the volumes of interest were then automatically drawn on the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum. The specific binding of 18F-FC119S to Abeta was quantified as the distribution volume ratio using Logan graphical analysis with the cerebellum as a reference tissue. The Abeta levels in the brain were also confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis. Result. For the 5xFAD group, radioactivity levels in the cortex, the hippocampus, and the thalamus were higher than those for the WT group. In these regions, specific binding was approximately 1.2-fold higher in 5xFAD mice than in WT. Immunohistochemistry supported these findings; the 5xFAD showed severe Abeta deposition in the cortex and hippocampus in contrast to the WT group. Conclusion. These results demonstrated that 18F-FC119S PET can successfully distinguish Abeta depositions in 5xFAD mice from WT.

29682395|t|A Pyridazine-Based Fluorescent Probe Targeting Abeta Plaques in Alzheimer's Disease.
29682395|a|Accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques comprising Abeta40 and Abeta42 in the brain is the most significant factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, the detection of Abeta plaques has increasingly attracted interest in the context of AD diagnosis. In the present study, a fluorescent pyridazine-based dye that can detect and image Abeta plaques was designed and synthesized, and its optical properties in the presence of Abeta aggregates were evaluated. An approximately 34-fold increase in emission intensity was exhibited by the fluorescent probe after binding with Abeta aggregates, for which it showed high affinity (KD  = 0.35 microM). Moreover, the reasonable hydrophobic properties of the probe (log P = 2.94) allow it to penetrate the blood brain barrier (BBB). In addition, the pyridazine-based probe was used in the histological costaining of transgenic mouse (APP/PS1) brain sections to validate the selective binding of the probe to Abeta plaques. The results suggest that the pyridazine-based compound has the potential to serve as a fluorescent probe for the diagnosis of AD.

29684530|t|Supratherapeutic concentrations of cilostazol inhibits beta-amyloid oligomerization in vitro.
29684530|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, and is currently incurable. The efficacy of existing treatments for AD such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors is limited to symptom improvement. Research on disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) has conventionally focused on amelioration of CNS pathogenesis. Two neuropathological changes correlate strongly with AD, the appearance of neurofibrillary tangles containing the microtubule-associated protein tau and extracellular amyloid deposits containing amyloid beta-protein (Abeta). The aggregation of Abeta is believed to be the key pathogenic event in AD, with oligomeric assemblies thought to be the most neurotoxic form. Inhibitors of oligomer formation, therefore, could be valuable therapeutics for AD patients. The clinical phosphodiesterase type-3 inhibitor cilostazol (CSZ) was recently found to suppress the progression of cognitive decline in patients with stable AD receiving acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Here we examined the effects of CSZ on in vitro aggregations of Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 including oligomerization, using the thioflavin T assay, photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins, and electron microscopy. CSZ (25-100 muM) inhibited Abeta aggregation, especially oligomer formation. Considering that CSZ might be a key molecule for DMTs of AD, it cannot be ruled out that the low concentration of CSZ achievable in patient dosing may display some ant-oligomeric activity in synergy with its known therapeutic effects.

29684683|t|Brain-related proteins as potential CSF biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease: A targeted mass spectrometry approach.
29684683|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, characterized by progressive cognitive decline. The main disease hallmarks include amyloid beta aggregates and neurofibrillary tangles. Brain pathology is reflected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); the core biomarkers amyloid beta 1-42, total and phosphorylated tau protein levels are changed, relative to cognitively normal elderly. Still, there is a need for additional biomarkers which could identify disease more accurately and at an earlier stage, predict severity and be used in research settings. Here we evaluated 30 brain-related proteins as candidate biomarkers of AD. Proteins were quantified in CSF samples from cognitively healthy individuals (n = 23) and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD (n = 20) or dementia due to AD (n = 10) using selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry assays. APLP1 protein was increased in MCI relative to control (p < 0.001). The best discrimination between MCI vs. controls was observed with a model combining APLP1 and SPP1 proteins (area under the curve, AUC = 0.84). The strongest associations between protein abundance and disease severity were found for APLP1, CNTN2 and SPP1 proteins, which had a significant correlation with MMSE and CDR tests (p < 0.05). This study identifies new proteins with biomarker potential at various stages of AD severity. SIGNIFICANCE: The current study evaluated 30 brain-related, highly specific proteins as candidate biomarkers of AD diagnosis. Protein APLP1 showed promise as early AD biomarker; protein panel APLP1 and SPP1 had the best diagnostic potential in discriminating MCI from control group, while proteins APLP1, SPP1 and CNTN2 may be indicators of disease progression, demonstrating weak to moderate correlation with cognitive tests. This study therefore identifies new proteins with biomarker potential at early AD stage. If the performance of proposed biomarkers is further confirmed, these proteins may add value in the clinic or clinical trial settings as diagnostic biomarkers (alone or in combination with the existing biomarkers) of the prodromal AD stage, and in monitoring disease progression.

29686045|t|Subthreshold Amyloid Predicts Tau Deposition in Aging.
29686045|a|Current approaches to the early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) rely upon classifying individuals as "positive" or "negative" for biomarkers related to the core pathology of beta-amyloid (Abeta). However, the accumulation of Abeta begins slowly, years before biomarkers become abnormal. We used longitudinal [11C] Pittsburgh Compound B PET scanning and neuropsychological assessment to investigate the earliest changes in AD pathology and how it affects memory in cognitively normal older humans (N = 71; mean age 75 years; 35% male). We used [18F] AV-1451 PET scanning at the end of the observation period to measure subsequent tau deposition in a subset of our sample (N = 37). We found evidence for an inverted-U relationship between baseline Abeta levels and Abeta slope in asymptomatic older adults, suggesting a slowing of Abeta accumulation even in cognitively normal adults. In participants who were nominally amyloid negative, both the rate of amyloid accumulation and the baseline levels of Abeta predicted early tau deposition in cortical Braak regions associated with AD. Amyloid measures were only sensitive to memory decline as baseline levels of Abeta increased, suggesting that pathological accumulation occurs before impacting memory. These findings support the necessity of early intervention with amyloid-lowering therapies even in those who are amyloid negative.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The progressive nature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) necessitates the earliest possible detection of pathological or cognitive change if disease progression is to be slowed. We examined cognitively normal older adults in whom AD pathology is starting to develop, with the goal of early detection of AD pathology or cognitive changes. We found amyloid measures to be sensitive early on in predicting subsequent early tau deposition. Further, it appears that rates of amyloid accumulation already begin to slow in preclinical AD, suggesting that it is a relatively late stage of AD progression. Thus, it is crucial to examine older adults early, before amyloid levels have saturated, to intervene to slow disease progression.

29686315|t|Structural and kinetic basis for the selectivity of aducanumab for aggregated forms of amyloid-beta.
29686315|a|Aducanumab, a human-derived antibody targeting amyloid-beta (Abeta), is in Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Biochemical and structural analyses show that aducanumab binds a linear epitope formed by amino acids 3-7 of the Abeta peptide. Aducanumab discriminates between monomers and oligomeric or fibrillar aggregates based on weak monovalent affinity, fast binding kinetics and strong avidity for epitope-rich aggregates. Direct comparative studies with analogs of gantenerumab, bapineuzumab and solanezumab demonstrate clear differentiation in the binding properties of these antibodies. The crystal structure of the Fab fragment of aducanumab bound to its epitope peptide reveals that aducanumab binds to the N terminus of Abeta in an extended conformation, distinct from those seen in structures with other antibodies that target this immunodominant epitope. Aducanumab recognizes a compact epitope that sits in a shallow pocket on the antibody surface. In silico analyses suggest that aducanumab interacts weakly with the Abeta monomer and may accommodate a variety of peptide conformations, further supporting its selectivity for Abeta aggregates. Our studies provide a structural rationale for the low affinity of aducanumab for non-pathogenic monomers and its greater selectivity for aggregated forms than is seen for other Abeta-targeting antibodies.

29687257|t|Diffusible, highly bioactive oligomers represent a critical minority of soluble Abeta in Alzheimer's disease brain.
29687257|a|Significant data suggest that soluble Abeta oligomers play an important role in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but there is great confusion over what exactly constitutes an Abeta oligomer and which oligomers are toxic. Most studies have utilized synthetic Abeta peptides, but the relevance of these test tube experiments to the conditions that prevail in AD is uncertain. A few groups have studied Abeta extracted from human brain, but they employed vigorous tissue homogenization which is likely to release insoluble Abeta that was sequestered in plaques during life. Several studies have found such extracts to possess disease-relevant activity and considerable efforts are being made to purify and better understand the forms of Abeta therein. Here, we compared the abundance of Abeta in AD extracts prepared by traditional homogenization versus using a far gentler extraction, and assessed their bioactivity via real-time imaging of iPSC-derived human neurons plus the sensitive functional assay of long-term potentiation. Surprisingly, the amount of Abeta retrieved by gentle extraction constituted only a small portion of that released by traditional homogenization, but this readily diffusible fraction retained all of the Abeta-dependent neurotoxic activity. Thus, the bulk of Abeta extractable from AD brain was innocuous, and only the small portion that was aqueously diffusible caused toxicity. This unexpected finding predicts that generic anti-oligomer therapies, including Abeta antibodies now in trials, may be bound up by the large pool of inactive oligomers, whereas agents that specifically target the small pool of diffusible, bioactive Abeta would be more useful. Furthermore, our results indicate that efforts to purify and target toxic Abeta must employ assays of disease-relevant activity. The approaches described here should enable these efforts, and may assist the study of other disease-associated aggregation-prone proteins.

29687857|t|Abeta1-42 regulates astrocytes through JNK/AP-1 pathway.
29687857|a|OBJECTIVE: In Alzheimer's disease (AD), astrocytes are generally found in the surrounding of senile plaques participating in the production of phagocytosis and the removal of toxic compounds such as Abeta. This study aimed at investigating the effect of Abeta1-42 on astrocytes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cellular viability of primary cultured astrocytes was analyzed using CCK-8 assay. Quantitative Real-time PCR was used to assess the mRNA expression of JNK and AP-1. The proteins of JNK/AP-1 pathway were investigated using Western blot. RESULTS: Our findings showed that Abeta1-42 inhibited cell viability and promoted apoptosis in astrocytes in primary culture. Additionally, Abeta1-42 increased the mRNA expression level of AP-1, but had no effect on the expression of JNK. Furthermore, Abeta1-42 increased the protein expression of p-JNK, p-c-jun and Fra-1 and the ratio of p-c-jun/c-jun and p-JNK/JNK. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that Abeta1-42 promoted cell apoptosis in astrocytes in primary culture. Furthermore, Abeta1-42 activated JNK/AP-1 pathway through promoting the phosphorylation of JNK, c-jun and Fra-1 expression, then inducing cell apoptosis.

29688240|t|Nanoscale synchrotron X-ray speciation of iron and calcium compounds in amyloid plaque cores from Alzheimer's disease subjects.
29688240|a|Altered metabolism of biometals in the brain is a key feature of Alzheimer's disease, and biometal interactions with amyloid-beta are linked to amyloid plaque formation. Iron-rich aggregates, including evidence for the mixed-valence iron oxide magnetite, are associated with amyloid plaques. To test the hypothesis that increased chemical reduction of iron, as observed in vitro in the presence of aggregating amyloid-beta, may occur at sites of amyloid plaque formation in the human brain, the nanoscale distribution and physicochemical states of biometals, particularly iron, were characterised in isolated amyloid plaque cores from human Alzheimer's disease cases using synchrotron X-ray spectromicroscopy. In situ X-ray magnetic circular dichroism revealed the presence of magnetite: a finding supported by ptychographic observation of an iron oxide crystal with the morphology of biogenic magnetite. The exceptional sensitivity and specificity of X-ray spectromicroscopy, combining chemical and magnetic probes, allowed enhanced differentiation of the iron oxides phases present. This facilitated the discovery and speciation of ferrous-rich phases and lower oxidation state phases resembling zero-valent iron as well as magnetite. Sequestered calcium was discovered in two distinct mineral forms suggesting a dynamic process of amyloid plaque calcification in vivo. The range of iron oxidation states present and the direct observation of biogenic magnetite provide unparalleled support for the hypothesis that chemical reduction of iron arises in conjunction with the formation of amyloid plaques. These new findings raise challenging questions about the relative impacts of amyloid-beta aggregation, plaque formation, and disrupted metal homeostasis on the oxidative burden observed in Alzheimer's disease.

29689721|t|Reaction of Amyloid-beta Peptide Antibody with Different Infectious Agents Involved in Alzheimer's Disease.
29689721|a|As early as the 1980s, molecular virologist Ruth Itzhaki began to investigate if there was a causal connection between infections and neurodegenerative disorder. Although the theory has yet to be universally embraced, in 2016 Itzhaki and 33 other scientists from all over the world published a review article in this very journal presenting evidence for the causal role of pathogens in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Exactly how and in what way pathogens affect the induction of AD has yet to be determined, but one possible answer may involve the cross-reactivity of different pathogens with amyloid-beta (Abeta). Abeta autoantibodies have been detected in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients and in some healthy individuals. In the present study our major goal was to investigate whether antibodies made against Abeta would react both with other brain proteins as well as pathogens associated with AD as a result of molecular mimicry or the binding of bacterial toxins to Abeta42. Our study used a specific monoclonal antibody made against Abeta42, which not only reacted strongly with Abeta42, tau protein, and alpha-synuclein, but also had from weak to strong reactions with 25 different pathogens or their molecules, some of which have been associated with AD. The homology between peptide stretches of microbial origin and proteins involved in AD could be a mechanism by which antibodies to homologous peptides mount attacks against autoantigens in AD. We concluded that bacterial molecules bind to Abeta protein, forming small oligomers, then encasing pathogens and their molecules to form amyloid plaques, the tell-tale markers of AD. Conversely, these same Abeta peptides induce the production of antibodies to both Abeta42 and bacterial molecules, which may inhibit bacterial pathogenesis, but in the process may promote amyloid plaque formation.

29689725|t|A Systematic Review and Aggregated Analysis on the Impact of Amyloid PET Brain Imaging on the Diagnosis, Diagnostic Confidence, and Management of Patients being Evaluated for Alzheimer's Disease.
29689725|a|BACKGROUND: Amyloid PET (aPET) imaging could improve patient outcomes in clinical practice, but the extent of impact needs quantification. OBJECTIVE: To provide an aggregated quantitative analysis of the value added by aPET in cognitively impaired subjects. METHODS: Systematic literature searches were performed in Embase and Medline until January 2017. 1,531 cases over 12 studies were included (1,142 cases over seven studies in the primary analysis where aPET was the key biomarker; the remaining cases included as defined groups in the secondary analysis). Data was abstracted by consensus among two observers and assessed for bias. Clinical utility was measured by diagnostic change, diagnostic confidence, and patient management before and after aPET. Three groups were further analyzed: control patients for whom feedback of aPET scan results was delayed; aPET Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC+) cases; and patients undergoing additional FDG/CSF testing. RESULTS: For 1,142 cases with only aPET, 31.3% of diagnoses were revised, whereas 3.2% of diagnoses changed in the delayed aPET control group (p < 0.0001). Increased diagnostic confidence following aPET was found for 62.1% of 870 patients. Management changes with aPET were found in 72.2% of 740 cases and in 55.5% of 299 cases in the control group (p < 0.0001). The diagnostic value of aPET in AUC+ patients or when FDG/CSF were additionally available did not substantially differ from the value of aPET alone in the wider population. CONCLUSIONS: Amyloid PET contributed to diagnostic revision in almost a third of cases and demonstrated value in increasing diagnostic confidence and refining management plans.

29695589|t|ABBY: A phase 2 randomized trial of crenezumab in mild to moderate Alzheimer disease.
29695589|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of crenezumab in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease (AD). METHODS: In this phase 2 trial, 431 patients with mild to moderate AD 50 to 80 years of age were randomized 2:1 (crenezumab:placebo). Patients received low-dose subcutaneous crenezumab 300 mg or placebo every 2 weeks (n = 184) or high-dose intravenous crenezumab 15 mg/kg or placebo every 4 weeks (n = 247) for 68 weeks. Primary outcome measures were change in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog12) and Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes scores from baseline to week 73. RESULTS: The primary and secondary endpoints were not met. In an exploratory post hoc analysis, a reduction in decline on the ADAS-Cog12 was observed in the high-dose group. Separation from the placebo group on the ADAS-Cog12 was greatest in the milder subsets of AD patients and reached statistical significance in the group with Mini-Mental State Examination scores of 22 to 26. In both groups, there was a significant increase in CSF beta-amyloid1-42 levels that correlated with crenezumab CSF levels. The overall rate of adverse events was balanced between groups. One case of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities indicative of vasogenic edema or effusions was reported. CONCLUSIONS: Although prespecified criteria for testing treatment effects were not met, these data suggest a potential treatment effect in patients with mild AD treated with high-dose crenezumab. Together with the safety profile for crenezumab, these data support the exploration of crenezumab treatment at even higher doses in patients with early AD. CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: NCT 01343966. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that, for people with AD, crenezumab does not significantly improve cognition or function at 18 months. The study is rated Class II because <80% of enrolled patients completed the study.

29695596|t|Amyloid deposition and brain structure as long-term predictors of MCI, dementia, and mortality.
29695596|a|OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that brain structural integrity (i.e., hippocampal [HIP] volume), white matter lesions (WMLs), and beta-amyloid deposition are associated with long-term increased risk of incident dementia and mortality in 183 cognitively normal individuals and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) aged 80 years and older. METHODS: All participants had a brain structural MRI scan and PET scan with 11C-labeled Pittsburgh compound B in 2009 and were reexamined yearly through 2015 (mean follow-up time 5.2 +- 1.3 years). RESULTS: In the last evaluation through 2010-2015, 56 (31%) participants were cognitively normal, 67 (37%) had MCI, and 60 (33%) had dementia. Fifty-seven (31%) died during follow-up, and 20 (35%) developed dementia before their death. All 3 biomarkers were independent predictors of incident dementia in all participants. After adjusting for the risk of dying, amyloid deposition and WMLs remained strong predictors. Of the 60 participants with incident dementia, 54 (90%) had at least one imaging abnormality. Participants with no biomarker positivity had a very low risk of dementia (16%), while 75% of the participants with the 3 biomarkers progressed to dementia. HIP volume and beta-amyloid deposition were associated with death only in participants with MCI. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed the presence of more than one biomarker was a stronger long-term predictor of incident dementia than any biomarker alone. After adjusting for the risk of dying, amyloid deposition and WMLs were stronger predictors of dementia than HIP volume. The risk of dying during follow-up was associated with both neurodegeneration and amyloid deposition, especially in individuals with MCI.

29697982|t|Viscoelasticity Response during Fibrillation of Amyloid beta Peptides on a Quartz-Crystal-Microbalance Biosensor.
29697982|a|Unlike previous in vitro measurements where Amyloid beta (Abeta) aggregation was studied in bulk solutions, we detect the structure change of the Abeta aggregate on the surface of a wireless quartz-crystal-microbalance biosensor, which resembles more closely the aggregation process on the cell membrane. Using a 58 MHz quartz crystal, we monitored changes in the viscoelastic properties of the aggregate formed on the quartz surface from monomers to oligomers and then to fibrils, involving up to the 7th overtone mode (406 MHz). With atomic-force microscopy observations, we found a significant stiffness increase as well as thinning of the protein layer during the structure change from oligomer to fibrils at 20 h, which indicates that the stiffness of the fibril is much higher. Viscoelasticity can provide a significant index of fibrillation and can be useful for evaluating inhibitory medicines in drug development.

29698605|t|Bioinspired Synthesis of Au Nanostructures Templated from Amyloid beta Peptide Assembly with Enhanced Catalytic Activity.
29698605|a|Peptides have been regarded as useful biomolecule templates to control the synthesis of various inorganic nanomaterials in mild conditions. Inspired by this, the easily self-assembled amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide was developed as an alternative template to prepare Au nanostructures for the enhanced catalytic activity, for instance, the reduction of 4-nitrophenol. The presence of Abeta peptide assemblies with different structures could direct the nucleation of Au to form different Au nanostructures. Using the Abeta25-35 monomers, nanoribbons, and nanofibrils prepared by the self-assembly in phosphate buffered (PB) solution at 0, 3, and 12 h, respectively, as templates could controllably prepare Au nanospheres, nanoribbons, and nanofibers, while the Abeta25-35 monomers prepared by the self-assembly in water at 0 h could direct the synthesis of Au nanoflowers. The Abeta25-35-templated Au nanostructures had different catalytic activities due to the size and structure effects, which however are significantly enhanced as compared with the template-free Au nanoparticles.

29698798|t|Positive effect of strong acidity on the twist of Abeta42 fibrils and the counteraction of Abeta42 N-terminus.
29698798|a|pH is a crucial factor in terms of affecting the aggregation and morphology of beta-Amyloid and hence a focus of study. In this study, structural and mechanical properties of a series of models (5, 6, ..., 30 layer) of one-fold Abeta42 fibrils at pH 1.5, 3.0 and 7.5, have been computed by using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. 12, 14, and 15 layers are established to be the smallest realistic models for Abeta42 fibrils at pH 1.5, 3.0 and 7.5, with twist angles of 0.40 , 0.34 , 0.31  respectively, disclosing the favorable effect of strong acidity on fibril twist. However, these angles are all lower than that (0.48 ) determined for the truncated Abeta17-42 fibril at pH 7.5, indicating that the disordered N-terminal depresses greatly the fibril twist and the lower pH disfavors the depression. Three commonly used indices to measure the fibril properties, namely number of H-bonds, interstrand distance and beta-sheet content have imperceptible changes with the pH alternation, therefore changes in fibril twist can be taken as a probe to monitor fibril properties. By contrast, N-terminus is determined not only to inhibit the U-shaped fibril twist by hampering the stagger between beta1 and beta2 strands, but also to play a vital carrier role in feeling solution (i.e., pH, salt) changes. These results can help design the nextgeneration of amyloid materials for state-of-the-art bio-nano-med applications by changing the solution pH or modifying chain length.

29701781|t|Mutant APP and amyloid beta-induced defective autophagy, mitophagy, mitochondrial structural and functional changes and synaptic damage in hippocampal neurons from Alzheimer's disease.
29701781|a|The purpose of our study was to determine the toxic effects of hippocampal mutant APP (mAPP) and amyloid beta (Abeta) in human mAPP complementary DNA (cDNA) transfected with primary mouse hippocampal neurons (HT22). Hippocampal tissues are the best source of studying learning and memory functions in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy controls. However, investigating immortalized hippocampal neurons that express AD proteins provide an excellent opportunity for drug testing. Using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting & immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy, we assessed messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels of synaptic, autophagy, mitophagy, mitochondrial dynamics, biogenesis, dendritic protein MAP2 and assessed mitochondrial number and length in mAPP-HT22 cells that express Swedish/Indiana mutations. Mitochondrial function was assessed by measuring the levels of hydrogen peroxide, lipid peroxidation, cytochrome c oxidase activity and mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate. Increased levels of mRNA and protein levels of mitochondrial fission genes, Drp1 and Fis1 and decreased levels fusion (Mfn1, Mfn2 and Opa1) biogenesis (PGC1alpha, NRF1, NRF2 & TFAM), autophagy (ATG5 & LC3BI, LC3BII), mitophagy (PINK1 & TERT, BCL2 & BNIPBL), synaptic (synaptophysin & PSD95) and dendritic (MAP2) genes were found in mAPP-HT22 cells relative to WT-HT22 cells. Cell survival was significantly reduced mAPP-HT22 cells. GTPase-Drp1 enzymatic activity was increased in mAPP-HT22 cells. Transmission electron microscopy revealed significantly increased mitochondrial numbers and reduced mitochondrial length in mAPP-HT22 cells. These findings suggest that hippocampal accumulation of mAPP and Abeta is responsible for abnormal mitochondrial dynamics and defective biogenesis, reduced MAP2, autophagy, mitophagy and synaptic proteins & reduced dendritic spines and mitochondrial structural and functional changes in mAPP hippocampal cells. These observations strongly suggest that accumulation of mAPP and Abeta causes mitochondrial, synaptic and autophagy/mitophagy abnormalities in hippocampal neurons, leading to neuronal dysfunction.

29702073|t|Membranes as modulators of amyloid protein misfolding and target of toxicity.
29702073|a|Abnormal protein aggregation is a hallmark of various human diseases. alpha-Synuclein, a protein implicated in Parkinson's disease, is found in aggregated form within Lewy bodies that are characteristically observed in the brains of PD patients. Similarly, deposits of aggregated human islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) are found in the pancreatic islets in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Significant number of studies have focused on how monomeric, disaggregated proteins transition into various amyloid structures leading to identification of a vast number of aggregation promoting molecules and processes over the years. Inasmuch as these factors likely enhance the formation of toxic, misfolded species, they might act as risk factors in disease. Cellular membranes, and particularly certain lipids, are considered to be among the major players for aggregation of alpha-synuclein and IAPP, and membranes might also be the target of toxicity. Past studies have utilized an array of biophysical tools, both in vitro and in vivo, to expound the membrane-mediated aggregation. Here, we focus on membrane interaction of alpha-synuclein and IAPP, and how various kinds of membranes catalyze or modulate the aggregation of these proteins and how, in turn, these proteins disrupt membrane integrity, both in vitro and in vivo. The membrane interaction and subsequent aggregation has been briefly contrasted to aggregation of alpha-synuclein and IAPP in solution. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Protein Aggregation and Misfolding at the Cell Membrane Interface edited by Ayyalusamy Ramamoorthy.

29702372|t|Cerebrospinal fluid beta-amyloid42 and neurofilament light relate to white matter hyperintensities.
29702372|a|White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are associated with poorer brain health, but their pathophysiological substrates remain elusive. To better understand the mechanistic underpinnings of WMHs among older adults, this study examined in vivo cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of beta-amyloid42 deposition (Abeta42), hyperphosphorylated tau pathology, neurodegeneration (total tau), and axonal injury (neurofilament light [NFL]) in relation to log-transformed WMHs volume. Participants free of clinical stroke and dementia were drawn from the Vanderbilt Memory & Aging Project (n = 148, 72 +- 6 years). Linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, intracranial volume, modified Framingham Stroke Risk Profile (excluding points assigned for age), cognitive diagnosis, and APOE-epsilon4 carrier status. Abeta42 (beta = -0.001, p = 0.007) and NFL (beta = 0.0003, p = 0.01) concentrations related to WMHs but neither hyperphosphorylated tau nor total tau associations with WMHs reached statistical significance (p-values > 0.21). In a combined model, NFL accounted for 3.2% of unique variance in WMHs and Abeta42 accounted for an additional 4.3% beyond NFL, providing novel evidence of the co-occurrence of at least 2 distinct pathways for WMHs among older adults, including amyloid deposition and axonal injury.

29704641|t|Chronically raised C-reactive protein is inversely associated with cortical beta-amyloid in older adults with subjective memory complaints.
29704641|a|BACKGROUND: Inflammation promotes amyloidogenesis in animals and markers of inflammation are associated with beta-amyloid (Abeta) in humans. Hence, we sought to examine the cross-sectional associations between chronically elevated plasma C reactive protein (CRP) and cortical Abeta in 259 non-demented elderly individuals reporting subjective memory complaints from the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT). METHODS: Cortical-to-cerebellar standard uptake value ratios were obtained using [18F] florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET). CRP was measured in plasma using immunoturbidity. Chronically raised CRP was defined as having 2 consecutively high CRP readings (>3 mg/l <= 10 mg/l) between study baseline and the 1 year visit (visits were performed at baseline, 6 months, 1 year and then annually). Associations were explored using adjusted multiple linear regression. RESULTS: Chronically raised CRP was found to be inversely associated with cortical Abeta (B-coefficient: -0.054, SE: 0.026, p = 0.040) and this association seemed to be specific to apolipoprotein E (Apo E) epsilon4 carriers (B-coefficient: -0.130, SE: 0.058, p = 0.027). CRP as an isolated reading measured closest to PET scan was also inversely associated with cortical Abeta when CRP was treated as a dichotomized variable (high CRP > 3 mg/l <= 10 mg/l, B-coefficient: -0.048, SE: 0.023, p = 0.043). CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary findings suggest that inflammation might be beneficial in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease as the immune systems attempts to combat Abeta pathology particularly in ApoE epsilon4 carriers. Investigating the temporal relationships between cerebral Abeta and a panel of inflammatory markers would provide further evidence as to whether chronic inflammation might modulate amyloidogenesis in vivo.

29706080|t|Bioactive Compounds of Kimchi Inhibit Apoptosis by Attenuating Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in the Brain of Amyloid beta-Injected Mice.
29706080|a|This study investigated the inhibitory effects of kimchi bioactive compounds against endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis in amyloid beta (Abeta)-injected mice. Mice received a single intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta25-35, except for the normal group. Mice were subjected to oral administration of 10 mg of capsaicin, 50 mg of 3-(4'-hydroxyl-3',5'-dimethoxyphenyl)propionic acid (HDMPPA), 50 mg of quercetin, 50 mg of ascorbic acid, or 200 mg of kimchi methanol extract (KME) per kilogram of body weight for 2 weeks ( n = 7 per group). In the in vitro blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability test, all bioactive compounds penetrated the BBB except ascorbic acid. The protein expression level of APP, BACE, and p-Tau elevated by Abeta injection was decreased by kimchi bioactive compounds ( P < 0.05). Quercetin, HDMPPA, and KME decreased oxidative stress, as indicated by ROS and TBARS levels ( P < 0.05). The protein expression level of ER stress markers GRP78, p-PERK, p-eIF2alpha, XBP1, and CHOP and the proapoptotic molecules Bax, p-JNK, and cleaved caspases-3 and -9 decreased ( P < 0.05). In contrast, the protein expression level of antiapoptotic molecules Bcl2 and cIAP increased ( P < 0.05). These results were supported by histological analysis.

29708745|t|The Neuronal Tau Protein Blocks in Vitro Fibrillation of the Amyloid-beta (Abeta) Peptide at the Oligomeric Stage.
29708745|a|In Alzheimer's disease, amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles are the two pathological hallmarks. The co-occurrence and combined reciprocal pathological effects of Abeta and tau protein aggregation have been observed in animal models of the disease. However, the molecular mechanism of their interaction remain unknown. Using a variety of biophysical measurements, we here show that the native full-length tau protein solubilizes the Abeta40 peptide and prevents its fibrillation. The tau protein delays the amyloid fibrillation of the Abeta40 peptide at substoichiometric ratios, showing different binding affinities toward the different stages of the aggregated Abeta40 peptides. The Abeta monomer structure remains random coil in the presence of tau, as observed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and photoinduced cross-linking methods. We propose a potential interaction mechanism for the influence of tau on Abeta fibrillation.

29710721|t|Change of Amyloid-beta 1-42 Toxic Conformer Ratio After Cerebrospinal Fluid Diversion Predicts Long-Term Cognitive Outcome in Patients with Idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus.
29710721|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) contributes to poor shunt responses. Amyloid-beta 1- 42 (Abeta42) toxic conformer was recently identified with features of rapid oligomerization, strong neurotoxicity and synaptotoxicity. OBJECTIVE: This observational study points to Abeta42 toxic conformer as a biomarker for AD pathology and for poor postoperative prognosis in patients with iNPH. METHODS: The first cohort consisted of patients with AD (n = 17) and iNPH (n = 17), and cognitively normal individuals (CN, n = 12). The second cohort, consisted of 51 patients with iNPH, was divided into two groups according to phosphorylated Tau (pTau) level (low- and high-pTau groups); the low-pTau group was further subdivided according to one-year postoperative change in Abeta42 toxic conformer ratio (%) [Abeta42 toxic conformer/Abeta42x100] (decreased- and increased-conformer subgroups). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure pTau, Abeta42, and Abeta42 toxic conformer in cerebrospinal fluid. Outcomes were evaluated using neuropsychological tests one- and two-years postoperatively. RESULTS: In the first cohort, Abeta42 toxic conformer ratio in the iNPH group (10.8%) was significantly higher than that in the CN group (6.3%) and significantly lower than that in the AD group (17.2%). In the second cohort, the high-pTau group showed cognitive decline two-years postoperatively compared to baseline. However, the low-pTau group showed favorable outcomes one-year postoperatively; furthermore, the increased-conformer subgroup showed cognitive decline two-years postoperatively while the decreased-conformer subgroup maintained the improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Change in Abeta42 toxic conformer ratio predicts long-term cognitive outcome in iNPH, even in the low-pTau group.

29713228|t|Blood-Brain Barrier Disruption and Perivascular Beta-Amyloid Accumulation in the Brain of Aged Rats with Spontaneous Hypertension: Evaluation with Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging.
29713228|a|Objective: Whether blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption induced by chronic spontaneous hypertension is associated with beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation in the brain remains poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between BBB disruption and Abeta influx and accumulation in the brain of aged rats with chronic spontaneous hypertension. Materials and Methods: Five aged spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and five age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were studied. The volume transfer constant (Ktrans) obtained from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) was used to evaluate BBB permeability in the hippocampus and cortex in vivo. The BBB tight junctions, immunoglobulin G (IgG), Abeta, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the hippocampus and cortex were examined with immunohistochemistry. Results: As compared with WKY rats, the Ktrans values in the hippocampus and cortex of the SHRs increased remarkably (0.316 +- 0.027 min-1 vs. 0.084 +- 0.017 min-1, p < 0.001 for hippocampus; 0.302 +- 0.072 min-1 vs. 0.052 +- 0.047 min-1, p < 0.001 for cortex). Dramatic occludin and zonula occludens-1 losses were detected in the hippocampus and cortex of SHRs, and obvious IgG exudation was found there. Dramatic Abeta accumulation was found and limited to the area surrounding the BBB, without extension to other parenchyma regions in the hippocampus and cortex of aged SHRs. Alternatively, differences in APP expression in the hippocampus and cortex were not significant. Conclusion: Blood-brain barrier disruption is associated with Abeta influx and accumulation in the brain of aged rats with chronic spontaneous hypertension. DCE-MRI can be used as an effective method to investigated BBB damage.

29713966|t|Inhibiting and Remodeling Toxic Amyloid-Beta Oligomer Formation Using a Computationally Designed Drug Molecule That Targets Alzheimer's Disease.
29713966|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is rapidly reaching epidemic status among a burgeoning aging population. Much evidence suggests the toxicity of this amyloid disease is most influenced by the formation of soluble oligomeric forms of amyloid beta-protein, particularly the 42-residue alloform (Abeta42). Developing potential therapeutics in a directed, streamlined approach to treating this disease is necessary. Here we utilize the joint pharmacophore space (JPS) model to design a new molecule [AC0107] incorporating structural characteristics of known Abeta inhibitors, blood-brain barrier permeability, and limited toxicity. To test the molecule's efficacy experimentally, we employed ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) to discover [AC0107] inhibits the formation of the toxic Abeta42 dodecamer at both high (1:10) and equimolar concentrations of inhibitor. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments reveal that [AC0107] prevents further aggregation of Abeta42, destabilizes preformed fibrils, and reverses Abeta42 aggregation. This trend continues for long-term interaction times of 2 days until only small aggregates remain with virtually no fibrils or higher order oligomers surviving. Pairing JPS with IM-MS and AFM presents a powerful and effective first step for AD drug development. Graphical Abstract.

29723530|t|Abeta1-40 mediated aggregation of proteins and metabolites unveils the relevance of amyloid cross-seeding in amyloidogenesis.
29723530|a|The multicomponent nature of neuronal plaques in Alzheimer's disease signifies the possible recruitment of non-Abeta candidates during the amyloid growth of Abeta peptides. Here, we show that amyloid fibrils of Abeta1-40 peptide can effectively initiate amyloid formation in different globular proteins and metabolites, converting native structures into beta-sheet rich assemblies. Structural and biophysical properties of the resultant protein fibrils display amyloid like characteristic features. Viable contacts between Abeta peptide's cross-beta architecture and the native structure of proteins, mediated through H-bonds and hydrophobic interactions seem crucial for the onset of amyloid cross-seeding. Results reveal the inherent cross-seeding potential of Abeta amyloids to initiate amyloid formation process in proteins and metabolites and revelation of such a property may further our mechanistic understanding of amyloid pathologies.

29724915|t|Proteasome stress leads to APP axonal transport defects by promoting its amyloidogenic processing in lysosomes.
29724915|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology includes the accumulation of poly-ubiquitylated (also known as poly-ubiquitinated) proteins and failures in proteasome-dependent degradation. Whereas the distribution of proteasomes and its role in synaptic function have been studied, whether proteasome activity regulates the axonal transport and metabolism of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), remains elusive. By using live imaging in primary hippocampal neurons, we showed that proteasome inhibition rapidly and severely impairs the axonal transport of APP. Fluorescence cross-correlation analyses and membrane internalization blockage experiments showed that plasma membrane APP does not contribute to transport defects. Moreover, by western blotting and double-color APP imaging, we demonstrated that proteasome inhibition precludes APP axonal transport by enhancing its endo-lysosomal delivery, where beta-cleavage is induced. Taken together, we found that proteasomes control the distal transport of APP and can re-distribute Golgi-derived vesicles to the endo-lysosomal pathway. This crosstalk between proteasomes and lysosomes regulates the intracellular APP dynamics, and defects in proteasome activity can be considered a contributing factor that leads to abnormal APP metabolism in AD.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.

29725676|t|Mechanistic insights into the inhibition and size effects of graphene oxide nanosheets on the aggregation of an amyloid-beta peptide fragment.
29725676|a|The aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta), which involves the formation of small oligomers and mature fibrils, has received considerable attention in the past few decades due to its close link with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The inhibition of beta-sheet formation has been considered as the primary therapeutic strategy for AD. In this respect, graphene oxide (GO) has gained significant attention because of its high solubility, good biocompatibility and inhibitory effect on the aggregation of Abeta and the 33-42 fragment (Abeta33-42). However, the inhibitory mechanism at the atomic level remains elusive. Herein, we investigated the oligomerization of Abeta33-42 by performing replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations on four Abeta33-42 peptide chains in the absence and presence of two different sizes of GO. Our simulations show that isolated Abeta33-42 can form fibril-prone extended beta-sheets and barrel-like structures, whereas they are suppressed in the presence of GO nanosheets. Our data reveal that GO inhibits Abeta33-42 oligomerization by making Abeta33-42 peptides separate from each other through strong interactions with M35. With the same total number of atoms, GO120 displays better inhibitory effect than GO60 by providing a larger effective contact surface area. This study provides the molecular mechanism of GO in inhibiting the aggregation of Abeta33-42, which might offer a theoretical insight into the design of drugs against AD at the atomic level.

29725819|t|Senataxin mutations elicit motor neuron degeneration phenotypes and yield TDP-43 mislocalization in ALS4 mice and human patients.
29725819|a|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis type 4 (ALS4) is a rare, early-onset, autosomal dominant form of ALS, characterized by slow disease progression and sparing of respiratory musculature. Dominant, gain-of-function mutations in the senataxin gene (SETX) cause ALS4, but the mechanistic basis for motor neuron toxicity is unknown. SETX is a RNA-binding protein with a highly conserved helicase domain, but does not possess a low-complexity domain, making it unique among ALS-linked disease proteins. We derived ALS4 mouse models by expressing two different senataxin gene mutations (R2136H and L389S) via transgenesis and knock-in gene targeting. Both approaches yielded SETX mutant mice that develop neuromuscular phenotypes and motor neuron degeneration. Neuropathological characterization of SETX mice revealed nuclear clearing of TDP-43, accompanied by TDP-43 cytosolic mislocalization, consistent with the hallmark pathology observed in human ALS patients. Postmortem material from ALS4 patients exhibited TDP-43 mislocalization in spinal cord motor neurons, and motor neurons from SETX ALS4 mice displayed enhanced stress granule formation. Immunostaining analysis for nucleocytoplasmic transport proteins Ran and RanGAP1 uncovered nuclear membrane abnormalities in the motor neurons of SETX ALS4 mice, and nuclear import was delayed in SETX ALS4 cortical neurons, indicative of impaired nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. SETX ALS4 mice thus recapitulated ALS disease phenotypes in association with TDP-43 mislocalization and provided insight into the basis for TDP-43 histopathology, linking SETX dysfunction to common pathways of ALS motor neuron degeneration.

29728560|t|Generation of App knock-in mice reveals deletion mutations protective against Alzheimer's disease-like pathology.
29728560|a|Although, a number of pathogenic mutations have been found for Alzheimer's disease (AD), only one protective mutation has been identified so far in humans. Here we identify possible protective deletion mutations in the 3'-UTR of the amyloid precursor protein (App) gene in mice. We use an App knock-in mouse model carrying a humanized Abeta sequence and three AD mutations in the endogenous App gene. Genome editing of the model zygotes using multiple combinations of CRISPR/Cas9 tools produces genetically mosaic animals with various App 3'-UTR deletions. Depending on the editing efficiency, the 3'-UTR disruption mitigates the Abeta pathology development through transcriptional and translational regulation of APP expression. Notably, an App knock-in mouse with a 34-bp deletion in a 52-bp regulatory element adjacent to the stop codon shows a substantial reduction in Abeta pathology. Further functional characterization of the identified element should provide deeper understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of AD.

29728565|t|A self-destructive nanosweeper that captures and clears amyloid beta-peptides.
29728565|a|Cerebral amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) accumulation resulting from an imbalance between Abeta production and clearance is one of the most important causes in the formation of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In order to preserve the maintenance of Abeta homeostasis and have a notable AD therapy, achieving a method to clear up Abeta plaques becomes an emerging task. Herein, we describe a self-destructive nanosweeper based on multifunctional peptide-polymers that is capable of capturing and clearing Abeta for the effective treatment of AD. The nanosweeper recognize and bind Abeta via co-assembly through hydrogen bonding interactions. The Abeta-loaded nanosweeper enters cells and upregulates autophagy thus promoting the degradation of Abeta. As a result, the nanosweeper decreases the cytotoxicity of Abeta and rescues memory deficits of AD transgenic mice. We believe that this resourceful and synergistic approach has valuable potential as an AD treatment strategy.

29729254|t|Physical exercise reserved amyloid-beta induced brain dysfunctions by regulating hippocampal neurogenesis and inflammatory response via MAPK signaling.
29729254|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the leading causes of dementia that induced by aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in brain tissue. With high structural and functional plasticity, hippocampus plays fundamental roles in cognitive regulation. Moreover, impaired hippocampal functions present during early onset of AD. Hence, targeting on improving hippocampal plasticity would be recognized as the effective strategy in AD therapy. Physical exercise is widely encouraged healthy life style. However, whether exercise could reserve the neural dysfunctions in AD model and the possible neurobiological mechanism still need for better understanding. In current study, we created the AD model by intra-hippocampal injection of Abeta. Afterward, mice were administrated with treadmill running to mimic the physical exercise. Our results show that physical exercise prevented the Abeta-induced cognitive deficits in object recognition task and the Morris water maze. Morphological studies reveal physical exercise increased the adult neurogenesis and release the immune-response in hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) region. In addition, physical exercise released the immune-response by decreasing the level of cytokines and population of astrocytes that elevated by injection of Abeta. We also found that physical exercise changed the modification of ERK, p38 and JNK, which recognized as the representative MAPK signaling involving with hippocampal neural functions. In conclusion, exercise serves as a potential strategy to prevent the development of AD by regulating adult neurogenesis and brain immune-activity via controlling MAPK signaling.

29729307|t|Virgin coconut oil (VCO) by normalizing NLRP3 inflammasome showed potential neuroprotective effects in Amyloid-beta induced toxicity and high-fat diet fed rat.
29729307|a|Both dyslipidemia and Alzheimer disease (AD) are associated with aging. In this study, the effects of virgin coconut oil (VCO) on inflammasome and oxidative stress in Alzheimer's model (receiving Amyloid-beta (Abeta)) and high-fat diet (HFD) model were determined. A total of 120 male Wistar rats, were divided into 12 groups (n = 10), including; healthy control, sham surgery, sham surgery receiving normal saline, HFD, HFD + 8% VCO, HFD + 10% VCO, Abeta received rats, Abeta + 8%VCO, Abeta + 10%VCO, HFD + Abeta, HFD + Abeta+8%VCO, and HFD + Abeta + 10%VCO. Following memory and learning tests, blood sample prepared from the heart and hippocampus of rats in each group was kept at -70  C for genes expression, oxidative stress, and biochemical tests. Abeta and HFD significantly impaired memory and learning by activating of both NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and oxidative stress (p<0.05), while treatment with both 8 and 10% VCO normalized inflammasome genes expression and oxidative stress (p<0.05). The Congo Red, Cresyl Violet staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC) test revealed that VCO improved hippocampus histological changes, reduced Abeta plaques and phosphorylated Tau. High-fat diet has exacerbated the effects of Abeta, while VCO showed potential neuroprotective effect.

29729423|t|Interaction between a MAPT variant causing frontotemporal dementia and mutant APP affects axonal transport.
29729423|a|In Alzheimer's disease, many indicators point to a central role for poor axonal transport, but the potential for stimulating axonal transport to alleviate the disease remains largely untested. Previously, we reported enhanced anterograde axonal transport of mitochondria in 8- to 11-month-old MAPTP301L knockin mice, a genetic model of frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism-17T. In this study, we further characterized the axonal transport of mitochondria in younger MAPTP301L mice crossed with the familial Alzheimer's disease model, TgCRND8, aiming to test whether boosting axonal transport in young TgCRND8 mice can alleviate axonal swelling. We successfully replicated the enhancement of anterograde axonal transport in young MAPTP301L/P301L knockin animals. Surprisingly, we found that in the presence of the amyloid precursor protein mutations, MAPTP301L/P3101L impaired anterograde axonal transport. The numbers of plaque-associated axonal swellings or amyloid plaques in TgCRND8 brains were unaltered. These findings suggest that amyloid-beta promotes an action of mutant tau that impairs axonal transport. As amyloid-beta levels increase with age even without amyloid precursor protein mutation, we suggest that this rise could contribute to age-related decline in frontotemporal dementia.

29729985|t|Novel 8-hydroxyquinoline derivatives targeting beta-amyloid aggregation, metal chelation and oxidative stress against Alzheimer's disease.
29729985|a|A series of multitargeted 8-hydroxyquinoline derivatives were designed and synthesized for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In vitro studies indicated that most of the prepared compounds exhibited significant inhibitory effects against self-induced Abeta1-42 aggregation and potential antioxidant properties especially compound 5b (IC50 = 5.64 muM for self-induced Abeta aggregation; the oxygen radical absorbance capacity using fluorescein (ORAC-FL) value is 2.63 Trolox equivalents). Notably, 5b can chelate biometals and inhibit Cu2+/Zn2+-induced Abeta1-42 aggregation. The cell assays showed that 5b had excellent protective effects against oxidative toxin H2O2 and presented low neurotoxicity in PC12 cells. Furthermore, 5b could penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in vitro and did not show any acute toxicity in mice at doses up to 2000 mg/kg in vivo. Our findings provide a rationale for the potential application of compound 5b as a lead compound in AD therapy.

29730823|t|The correlation between striatal and cortical binding ratio of 11C-PiB-PET in amyloid-uptake-positive patients.
29730823|a|PURPOSE: In subjects with amyloid deposition, striatal accumulation of 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) demonstrated by positron emission tomography (PET) is related to the stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we investigated the correlation between striatal and cortical non-displaceable binding potential (BPND). METHODS: Seventy-three subjects who complained of cognitive disturbance underwent dynamic PiB-PET studies and showed positive PiB accumulation were retrospectively selected. These subjects included 34 AD, 26 mild cognitive impairment, 2 frontotemporal lobar degeneration, 2 Parkinson's disease, 5 dementia with Lewy bodies, and 4 undefined diagnosis patients. Individual BPND images were produced from the dynamic data of the PiB-PET study, and voxel-based analyses were performed to estimate the correlations between striatal and other regional cortical BPND measures. RESULTS: There were highly significant correlations between striatal and prefrontal BPND, with the highest correlation being demonstrated in left Brodmann area 11. We found that almost all of the high cortical BPND values correlated with striatal BPND values, with the exception of the occipital cortex with low correlation. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated positive correlations in amyloid deposits between the striatum and other cortical areas with functional and anatomical links. The amyloid distribution in the brain is not random, but spreads following the functional and anatomical connections.

29733334|t|Tau reduction in the presence of amyloid-beta prevents tau pathology and neuronal death in vivo.
29733334|a|Several studies have now supported the use of a tau lowering agent as a possible therapy in the treatment of tauopathy disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. In human Alzheimer's disease, however, concurrent amyloid-beta deposition appears to synergize and accelerate tau pathological changes. Thus far, tau reduction strategies that have been tested in vivo have been examined in the setting of tau pathology without confounding amyloid-beta deposition. To determine whether reducing total human tau expression in a transgenic model where there is concurrent amyloid-beta plaque formation can still reduce tau pathology and protect against neuronal loss, we have taken advantage of the regulatable tau transgene in APP/PS1 x rTg4510 mice. These mice develop both neurofibrillary tangles as well as amyloid-beta plaques throughout the cortex and hippocampus. By suppressing human tau expression for 6 months in the APP/PS1 x rTg4510 mice using doxycycline, AT8 tau pathology, bioactivity, and astrogliosis were reduced, though importantly to a lesser extent than lowering tau in the rTg4510 alone mice. Based on non-denaturing gels and proteinase K digestions, the remaining tau aggregates in the presence of amyloid-beta exhibit a longer-lived aggregate conformation. Nonetheless, lowering the expression of the human tau transgene was sufficient to equally ameliorate thioflavin-S positive tangles and prevent neuronal loss equally well in both the APP/PS1 x rTg4510 mice and the rTg4510 cohort. Together, these results suggest that, although amyloid-beta stabilizes tau aggregates, lowering total tau levels is still an effective strategy for the treatment of tau pathology and neuronal loss even in the presence of amyloid-beta deposition.

29733614|t|Rational Design of Novel 1,3-Oxazine Based beta-Secretase (BACE1) Inhibitors: Incorporation of a Double Bond To Reduce P-gp Efflux Leading to Robust Abeta Reduction in the Brain.
29733614|a|Accumulation of Abeta peptides is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is considered a causal factor in the pathogenesis of AD. beta-Secretase (BACE1) is a key enzyme responsible for producing Abeta peptides, and thus agents that inhibit BACE1 should be beneficial for disease-modifying treatment of AD. Here we describe the discovery and optimization of novel oxazine-based BACE1 inhibitors by lowering amidine basicity with the incorporation of a double bond to improve brain penetration. Starting from a 1,3-dihydrooxazine lead 6 identified by a hit-to-lead SAR following HTS, we adopted a p Ka lowering strategy to reduce the P-gp efflux and the high hERG potential leading to the discovery of 15 that produced significant Abeta reduction with long duration in pharmacodynamic models and exhibited wide safety margins in cardiovascular safety models. This compound improved the brain-to-plasma ratio relative to 6 by reducing P-gp recognition, which was demonstrated by a P-gp knockout mouse model.

29734108|t|Quantum dots-based sandwich immunoassay for sensitive detection of Alzheimer's disease-related Abeta1-42.
29734108|a|Amyloid-beta peptide 1-42 (Abeta1-42) is known as a component of amyloid plaques in association with Alzheimer's disease. Herein, we developed a reliable and remarkably sensitive sandwich immunoassay to detect the Abeta1-42 using quantum dots (QDs) as fluorescent label. In the presence of Abeta1-42, the biotinylated Anti-beta Amyloid 1-16 (N-Ab) recognized the target and formed C-Ab-Abeta1-42-N-Ab sandwich immunocomplexes. Then Streptavidin-QDs conjugated to biotinylated N-Ab and the concentration of Abeta1-42 was determined by detecting the fluorescence intensity in the supernatant. This method is faster and more efficient than the previous approach we reported. It also has reasonable sensitivity and selectivity. Under the optimized conditions, the linear range is 5.0 to 100 pM (0.023-0.45 ng/mL) and the detection limit is 1.7 pM (7.6 pg/ mL). In addition, this method has been successfully applied to detect the Abeta1-42 in human cerebrospinal fluid sample.

29735432|t|The retina as a window to early dysfunctions of Alzheimer's disease following studies with a 5xFAD mouse model.
29735432|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease leading to neuronal dysfunctions with cognitive impairment. AD can affect visual pathways and visual cortex and result in various visual changes and problems. However, how early the visual dysfunctions occur in AD is still a matter of discussion. Here, we used electrophysiological techniques to show the presence of early anomalies in AD visual system. To this aim, we used a familial AD (FAD) model, the 5xFAD transgenic mouse, characterized by severe progressive amyloid pathology and cognitive deficits. We investigated the retina and primary visual cortex responsivity together with behavioral assessment of the visual acuity. Visual tests and recordings were conducted at different ages in 5xFAD mice, corresponding to different phases of neurodegeneration and beta amyloid accumulation. We showed that the visual system is impaired in 5xFAD mice. In particular, we found that the inner retina impairment precedes neuronal disorders in other brain areas and cognitive deficits. Thus, noninvasive retinal electrophysiology can provide a support for assessing early visual dysfunctions in AD.

29738067|t|N-Terminal Charged Residues of Amyloid-beta Peptide Modulate Amyloidogenesis and Interaction with Lipid Membrane.
29738067|a|Interactions of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides and cellular membranes are proposed to be closely related with Abeta neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we systematically investigated the effect of the N-terminal hydrophilic region of Abeta40 on its amyloidogenesis and interaction with supported phospholipid bilayer. Our results show that modulation of the charge properties of the dynamic N-terminal region dramatically influences the aggregation properties of Abeta. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the N-terminal charged residues play a crucial role in driving the early adsorption and latter remobilization of the peptide on membrane bilayer, and mediating the rigidity and viscoelasticity properties of the bound Abeta40 at the membrane interface. The results provide new mechanistic insight into the early Abeta-membrane interactions and binding, which may be critical for elucidating membrane-mediated Abeta amyloidogenesis in a physiological environment and unravelling the origin of Abeta neurotoxicity.

29738880|t|The interaction of alpha-synuclein and Tau: A molecular conspiracy in neurodegeneration?
29738880|a|alpha-synuclein and Tau are proteins prone to pathological misfolding and aggregation that are normally found in the presynaptic and axonal compartments of neurons. Misfolding initiates a homo-oligomerization and aggregation cascade culminating in cerebral accumulation of aggregated alpha-synuclein and Tau in insoluble protein inclusions in multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Traditionally, alpha-synuclein-containing Lewy bodies have been associated with Parkinson's disease and Tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles with Alzheimer's disease and various frontotemporal dementia syndromes. However, there is significant overlap and co-occurrence of alpha-synuclein and Tau pathologies in a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases. Importantly, alpha-synuclein and Tau can interact in cells, and their pathological conformations are capable of templating further misfolding and aggregation of each other. They also share a number of protein interactors indicating that network perturbations may contribute to chronic proteotoxic stress and neuronal dysfunction in synucleinopathies and tauopathies, some of which share similarities in both neuropathological and clinical manifestations. In this review, we focus on the protein interactions of these two pathologically important proteins and consider a network biology perspective towards neurodegenerative diseases.

29739836|t|Inhibition of PKCdelta reduces amyloid-beta levels and reverses Alzheimer disease phenotypes.
29739836|a|beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD). Abeta is generated from sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and the gamma-secretase complex. Although activation of some protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms such as PKCalpha and epsilon has been shown to regulate nonamyloidogenic pathways and Abeta degradation, it is unclear whether other PKC isoforms are involved in APP processing/AD pathogenesis. In this study, we report that increased PKCdelta levels correlate with BACE1 expression in the AD brain. PKCdelta knockdown reduces BACE1 expression, BACE1-mediated APP processing, and Abeta production. Conversely, overexpression of PKCdelta increases BACE1 expression and Abeta generation. Importantly, inhibition of PKCdelta by rottlerin markedly reduces BACE1 expression, Abeta levels, and neuritic plaque formation and rescues cognitive deficits in an APP Swedish mutations K594N/M595L/presenilin-1 with an exon 9 deletion-transgenic AD mouse model. Our study indicates that PKCdelta plays an important role in aggravating AD pathogenesis, and PKCdelta may be a potential target in AD therapeutics.

29740062|t|The contribution of microglia to early synaptic compensatory responses that precede beta-amyloid-induced neuronal death.
29740062|a|Glial-neuronal cross-talk has a critical role in the development of neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's Disease, where it affects neuronal responses to beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta)-induced toxicity. We set out to identify factors regulating synaptic responses to Abeta, dissecting the specific role of glial signaling. A low concentration of aggregated Abeta42 induced selective up-regulation of mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression and release in rat organotypic hippocampal cultures as well as in cortical pure microglia. Conditioned media from resting (CMC) or Abeta42-treated (CMA) microglia were tested for their effects on synaptophysin expression in SH-SY5Y neuronal-like cells during challenge with Abeta42. Both CMC and CMA prevented Abeta-induced synaptophysin loss. In the presence of Abeta + CMA, synaptophysin was over-expressed, although it appeared partly clumped in cell bodies. Synaptophysin over-expression was not directly dependent on BDNF signaling on neuronal-like cells, but relied on autocrine BDNF action on microglia. FM1-43 labeling experiments revealed compromised synaptic vesicle recycling in Abeta42-treated neuronal-like cells, rescued by microglial conditioned medium. In these conditions, significant and prolonged neuroprotection was observed. Our results point to microglia as a target for early intervention, given its positive role in supporting neuronal compensatory responses to Abeta synaptotoxicity, which potentially lead to their extended survival.

29743204|t|ApoE isoforms and carboxyl-terminal-truncated apoE4 forms affect neuronal BACE1 levels and Abeta production independently of their cholesterol efflux capacity.
29743204|a|The beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) initiates the production of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), which is central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Changes in brain cholesterol homeostasis have been suggested to affect Abeta metabolism. Cholesterol homeostasis is maintained in the brain by apolipoprotein E (apoE). The apoE4 isoform constitutes the major risk factor for AD. Here, we investigated the effect of apoE forms on Abeta generation and on BACE1 levels. We also examined the potential involvement in these processes of cholesterol transporters ABCG1 and ABCG4 or the lipoprotein receptor SR-BI, which are implicated in cholesterol efflux to apoE. It was found that reconstituted lipoprotein-associated apoE isoforms promoted the increase of Abeta production and oligomerization and of BACE1 levels in human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells, with an apoE4 >= apoE3 > apoE2 potency rank order. Progressive carboxyl-terminal apoE4 deletions between residues 230-299 decreased the protein's ability to increase BACE1, while further truncations up to residue 166 prevented apoE4 from increasing BACE1 and Abeta levels in SK-N-SH and primary mouse neuronal cells. ABCG1, but not ABCG4 or SR-BI, moderately increased Abeta production and BACE1 levels in SK-N-SH cells. All apoE forms affected Abeta production/oligomerization and BACE1 levels in a pattern that did not follow that of their capacity to promote ABCG1, ABCG4 or SR-BI-mediated cholesterol efflux. Overall, our data indicate that apoE-containing lipoprotein particles can have a direct effect on BACE1 levels and Abeta secretion and possibly contribute to AD pathogenetic processes, independently of their capacity to promote cholesterol efflux.

29743672|t|Cellular milieu imparts distinct pathological alpha-synuclein strains in alpha-synucleinopathies.
29743672|a|In Lewy body diseases-including Parkinson's disease, without or with dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, and Alzheimer's disease with Lewy body co-pathology 1 -alpha-synuclein (alpha-Syn) aggregates in neurons as Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites 2 . By contrast, in multiple system atrophy alpha-Syn accumulates mainly in oligodendrocytes as glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) 3 . Here we report that pathological alpha-Syn in GCIs and Lewy bodies (GCI-alpha-Syn and LB-alpha-Syn, respectively) is conformationally and biologically distinct. GCI-alpha-Syn forms structures that are more compact and it is about 1,000-fold more potent than LB-alpha-Syn in seeding alpha-Syn aggregation, consistent with the highly aggressive nature of multiple system atrophy. GCI-alpha-Syn and LB-alpha-Syn show no cell-type preference in seeding alpha-Syn pathology, which raises the question of why they demonstrate different cell-type distributions in Lewy body disease versus multiple system atrophy. We found that oligodendrocytes but not neurons transform misfolded alpha-Syn into a GCI-like strain, highlighting the fact that distinct alpha-Syn strains are generated by different intracellular milieus. Moreover, GCI-alpha-Syn maintains its high seeding activity when propagated in neurons. Thus, alpha-Syn strains are determined by both misfolded seeds and intracellular environments.

29745222|a|In line with the modern multi-target-directed ligand paradigm of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a series of 19 compounds composed of flavone and cyanoacetamide groups have been synthesized and evaluated as multifunctional agents against AD. Biological evaluation demonstrated that compounds 7j, 7n, 7o, 7r, and 7s exhibited excellent inhibitory potency (AChE, IC50 of 0.271 +- 0.012 to 1.006 +- 0.075 muM) and good selectivity toward acetylcholinesterase, significant antioxidant activity, good modulation effects on self-induced Abeta aggregation, low cytotoxicity, and neuroprotection in human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells. Further, an inclusive study on the interaction of 7j, 7n, 7o, 7r, and 7s with AChE at physiological pH 7.2 using fluorescence, circular dichroism, and molecular docking methods suggested that these derivatives bind strongly to the peripheral anionic site of AChE mostly through hydrophobic interactions. Overall, the multifunctional profiles and strong AChE binding affinity highlight these compounds as promising prototypes for further pursuit of innovative multifunctional drugs for AD.

29747683|t|Reduced penetrance of the PSEN1 H163Y autosomal dominant Alzheimer mutation: a 22-year follow-up study.
29747683|a|BACKGROUND: The range of onset ages within some PSEN1 families is wide, and a few cases of reduced penetrance of PSEN1 mutations have been reported. However, published data on reduced penetrance have been limited to clinical histories, often collected retrospectively and lacking biomarker information. We present a case of reduced penetrance of the PSEN1 H163Y mutation in a carrier prospectively followed for 22 years. METHODS: Two brothers (A and B), both carriers of the H163Y mutation, were followed between 1995 and 2017. They underwent repeated clinical evaluations, neuropsychological assessments, and cerebrospinal fluid analyses, as well as brain imaging examinations with structural magnetic resonance, [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, and [11C]Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography. RESULTS: Brother A was followed between 44 and 64 years of age. Cognitive symptoms due to Alzheimer's disease set in at the age of 54. Gradual worsening of symptoms resulted in admittance to a nursing home owing to dependence on others for all activities of daily living. He showed a curvilinear decline in cognitive function on neuropsychological tests, and changes on magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid supported a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Brother A died at the age of 64 and fulfilled the criteria for definitive Alzheimer's disease according to neuropathological examination results. Brother B was followed between the ages of 43 and 65 and showed no cognitive deterioration on repeated neuropsychological test occasions. In addition, no biomarker evidence of Alzheimer's disease pathology was detected, either on imaging examinations or in cerebrospinal fluid. CONCLUSIONS: The average (SD) age of symptom onset for PSEN1 H163Y is 51 +- 7 years according to previous studies. However, we present a case of a biomarker-verified reduction in penetrance in a mutation carrier who was still symptom-free at the age of 65. This suggests that other genetic, epigenetic, and/or environmental factors modify the onset age.

29751013|t|The Properties of Amyloid-beta Fibrils Are Determined by their Path of Formation.
29751013|a|Fibril formation of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) follows a nucleation-dependent polymerization process and is associated with Alzheimer's disease. Several different lengths of Abeta are observed in vivo, but Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 are the dominant forms. The fibril architectures of Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 differ and Abeta1-42 assemblies are generally considered more pathogenic. We show here that monomeric Abeta1-42 can be cross-templated and incorporated into the ends of Abeta1-40 fibrils, while incorporation of Abeta1-40 monomers into Abeta1-42 fibrils is very poor. We also show that via cross-templating incorporated Abeta monomers acquire the properties of the parental fibrils. The suppressed ability of Abeta1-40 to incorporate into the ends of Abeta1-42 fibrils and the capacity of Abeta1-42 monomers to adopt the properties of Abeta1-40 fibrils may thus represent two mechanisms reducing the total load of fibrils having the intrinsic, and possibly pathogenic, features of Abeta1-42 fibrils in vivo. We also show that the transfer of fibrillar properties is restricted to fibril-end templating and does not apply to cross-nucleation via the recently described path of surface-catalyzed secondary nucleation, which instead generates similar structures to those acquired via de novo primary nucleation in the absence of catalyzing seeds. Taken together these results uncover an intrinsic barrier that prevents Abeta1-40 from adopting the fibrillar properties of Abeta1-42 and exposes that the transfer of properties between amyloid-beta fibrils are determined by their path of formation.

29751288|t|Predicted sequence of cortical tau and amyloid-beta deposition in Alzheimer disease spectrum.
29751288|a|We investigated sequential order between tau and amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition in Alzheimer disease spectrum using a conditional probability method. Two hundred twenty participants underwent 18F-flortaucipir and 18F-florbetaben positron emission tomography scans and neuropsychological tests. The presence of tau and Abeta in each region and impairment in each cognitive domain were determined by Z-score cutoffs. By comparing pairs of conditional probabilities, the sequential order of tau and Abeta deposition were determined. Probability for the presence of tau in the entorhinal cortex was higher than that of Abeta in all cortical regions, and in the medial temporal cortices, probability for the presence of tau was higher than that of Abeta. Conversely, in the remaining neocortex above the inferior temporal cortex, probability for the presence of Abeta was always higher than that of tau. Tau pathology in the entorhinal cortex may appear earlier than neocortical Abeta and may spread in the absence of Abeta within the neighboring medial temporal regions. However, Abeta may be required for massive tau deposition in the distant cortical areas.

29752072|t|TAR DNA-Binding Protein 43 and Disrupted in Schizophrenia 1 Coaggregation Disrupts Dendritic Local Translation and Mental Function in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration.
29752072|a|BACKGROUND: Neurodegenerative diseases involving protein aggregation often accompany psychiatric symptoms. Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) associated with TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) aggregation is characterized by progressive neuronal atrophy in frontal and temporal lobes of cerebral cortex. Furthermore, patients with FTLD display mental dysfunction in multiple behavioral dimensions. Nevertheless, their molecular origin for psychiatric symptoms remains unclear. METHODS: In FTLD neurons and mouse models with TDP-43 aggregates, we examined coaggregation between TDP-43 and disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1), a key player in the pathology of mental conditions and its effects on local translation in dendrites and psychiatric behaviors. The protein coaggregation and the expression level of synaptic proteins were also investigated with postmortem brains from patients with FTLD (n = 6). RESULTS: We found cytosolic TDP-43/DISC1 coaggregates in brains of both FTLD mouse model and patients with FTLD. At the mechanistic levels, the TDP-43/DISC1 coaggregates disrupted the activity-dependent dendritic local translation through impairment of translation initiation and, in turn, reduced synaptic protein expression. Behavioral deficits detected in FTLD model mice were ameliorated by exogenous DISC1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal a novel role of the aggregate-prone TDP-43/DISC1 protein complex in regulating local translation, which affects aberrant behaviors relevant to multiple psychiatric dimensions.

29752551|t|Tau seeding activity begins in the transentorhinal/entorhinal regions and anticipates phospho-tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease and PART.
29752551|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by accumulation of tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and, according to the prion model, transcellular propagation of pathological "seeds" may underlie its progression. Staging of NFT pathology with phospho-tau antibody is useful to classify AD and primary age-related tauopathy (PART) cases. The locus coeruleus (LC) shows the earliest phospho-tau signal, whereas other studies suggest that pathology begins in the transentorhinal/entorhinal cortices (TRE/EC). The relationship of tau seeding activity, phospho-tau pathology, and progression of neurodegeneration remains obscure. Consequently, we employed an established cellular biosensor assay to quantify tau seeding activity in fixed human tissue, in parallel with AT8 phospho-tau staining of immediately adjacent sections. We studied four brain regions from each of n = 247 individuals across a range of disease stages. We detected the earliest and most robust seeding activity in the TRE/EC. The LC did not uniformly exhibit seeding activity until later NFT stages. We also detected seeding activity in the superior temporal gyrus (STG) and primary visual cortex (VC) at stages before NFTs and/or AT8-immunopositivity were detectable. AD and putative PART cases exhibited similar patterns of seeding activity that anticipated histopathology across all NFT stages. Our findings are consistent with the prion model and suggest that pathological seeding activity begins in the TRE/EC rather than in the LC. In the analysis of tauopathy, quantification of seeding activity may offer an important addition to classical histopathology.

29754989|t|The Brain Health Registry: An internet-based platform for recruitment, assessment, and longitudinal monitoring of participants for neuroscience studies.
29754989|a|INTRODUCTION: Recruitment, assessment, and longitudinal monitoring of participants for neuroscience studies and clinical trials limit the development of new treatments. Widespread Internet use allows data capture from participants in an unsupervised setting. The Brain Health Registry, a website and online registry, collects data from participants and their study partners. METHODS: The Brain Health Registry obtains self and study partner report questionnaires and neuropsychological data, including the Cogstate Brief Battery, Lumos Labs Neurocognitive Performance Test, and MemTrax Memory Test. Participants provide informed consent before participation. RESULTS: Baseline and longitudinal data were obtained from nearly 57,000 and 28,000 participants, respectively. Over 18,800 participants were referred to, and nearly 1800 were enrolled in, clinical Alzheimer's disease and aging studies, including five observational studies and seven intervention trials. DISCUSSION: Online assessments of participants and study partners provide useful information at relatively low cost for neuroscience studies and clinical trials and may ultimately be used in routine clinical practice.

29757632|t|An Efficient Method for the Expression and Purification of Abeta(M1-42).
29757632|a|Advances in amyloid research rely on improved access to the beta-amyloid peptide, Abeta. N-Terminal methionine-extended Abeta, Abeta(M1-42), is a readily expressed and widely used form of Abeta with properties comparable to those of the natural Abeta(1-42) peptide. Expression of Abeta(M1-42) is simple to execute and avoids an expensive and often difficult enzymatic cleavage step associated with expression and isolation of Abeta(1-42). This paper reports an efficient method for the expression and purification of Abeta(M1-42) and 15N-labeled Abeta(M1-42). This method affords the pure peptide at ~19 mg/L of bacterial culture through simple and inexpensive steps in 3 days. This paper also reports a simple method for the construction of recombinant plasmids and the expression and purification of Abeta(M1-42) peptides containing familial mutations. We anticipate that these methods will enable experiments that would otherwise be hindered by insufficient access to Abeta.

29759078|t|Transcriptome analysis of alcohol-treated microglia reveals downregulation of beta amyloid phagocytosis.
29759078|a|BACKGROUND: Microglial activation contributes to the neuropathology associated with chronic alcohol exposure and withdrawal, including the expression of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory genes. In the current study, we examined the transcriptome of primary rat microglial cells following incubation with alcohol alone, or alcohol together with a robust inflammatory stimulus. METHODS: Primary microglia were prepared from mixed rat glial cultures. Cells were incubated with 75 mM ethanol alone or with proinflammatory cytokines ("TII": IL1beta, IFNgamma, and TNFalpha). Isolated mRNA was used for RNAseq analysis and qPCR. Effects of alcohol on phagocytosis were determined by uptake of oligomeric amyloid beta. RESULTS: Alcohol induced nitrite production in control cells and increased nitrite production in cells co-treated with TII. RNAseq analysis of microglia exposed for 24 h to alcohol identified 312 differentially expressed mRNAs ("Alc-DEs"), with changes confirmed by qPCR analysis. Gene ontology analysis identified phagosome as one of the highest-ranking KEGG pathways including transcripts regulating phagocytosis. Alcohol also increased several complement-related mRNAs that have roles in phagocytosis, including C1qa, b, and c; C3; and C3aR1. RNAseq analysis identified over 3000 differentially expressed mRNAs in microglia following overnight incubation with TII; and comparison to the group of Alc-DEs revealed 87 mRNAs modulated by alcohol but not by TII, including C1qa, b, and c. Consistent with observed changes in phagocytosis-related mRNAs, the uptake of amyloid beta1-42, by primary microglia, was reduced by alcohol. CONCLUSIONS: Our results define alterations that occur to microglial gene expression following alcohol exposure and suggest that alcohol effects on phagocytosis could contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease.

29769266|t|Regulation of BDNF Release by ARMS/Kidins220 through Modulation of Synaptotagmin-IV Levels.
29769266|a|BDNF is a growth factor with important roles in the nervous system in both physiological and pathological conditions, but the mechanisms controlling its secretion are not completely understood. Here, we show that ARMS/Kidins220 negatively regulates BDNF secretion in neurons from the CNS and PNS. Downregulation of the ARMS/Kidins220 protein in the adult mouse brain increases regulated BDNF secretion, leading to its accumulation in the striatum. Interestingly, two mouse models of Huntington's disease (HD) showed increased levels of ARMS/Kidins220 in the hippocampus and regulated BDNF secretion deficits. Importantly, reduction of ARMS/Kidins220 in hippocampal slices from HD mice reversed the impaired regulated BDNF release. Moreover, there are increased levels of ARMS/Kidins220 in the hippocampus and PFC of patients with HD. ARMS/Kidins220 regulates Synaptotagmin-IV levels, which has been previously observed to modulate BDNF secretion. These data indicate that ARMS/Kidins220 controls the regulated secretion of BDNF and might play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of HD.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT BDNF is an important growth factor that plays a fundamental role in the correct functioning of the CNS. The secretion of BDNF must be properly controlled to exert its functions, but the proteins regulating its release are not completely known. Using neuronal cultures and a new conditional mouse to modulate ARMS/Kidins220 protein, we report that ARMS/Kidins220 negatively regulates BDNF secretion. Moreover, ARMS/Kidins220 is overexpressed in two mouse models of Huntington's disease (HD), causing an impaired regulation of BDNF secretion. Furthermore, ARMS/Kidins220 levels are increased in brain samples from HD patients. Future studies should address whether ARMS/Kidins220 has any function on the pathophysiology of HD.

29770576|t|The Extracellular Zn2+ Concentration Surrounding Excited Neurons Is High Enough to Bind Amyloid-beta Revealed by a Nanowire Transistor.
29770576|a|The Zn2+ stored in the secretory vesicles of glutamatergic neurons is coreleased with glutamate upon stimulation, resulting in the elevation of extracellular Zn2+ concentration (CZn2+ex). This elevation of CZn2+ex regulates the neurotransmission and facilitates the fibrilization of amyloid-beta (Abeta). However, the exact CZn2+ex surrounding neurons under (patho)physiological conditions is not clear and the connection between CZn2+ex and the Abeta fibrilization remains obscure. Here, a silicon nanowire field-effect transistor (SiNW-FET) with the Zn2+ -sensitive fluorophore, FluoZin-3 (FZ-3), to quantify the CZn2+ex in real time is modified. This FZ-3/SiNW-FET device has a dissociation constant of  12 x 10-9 m against Zn2+ . By placing a coverslip seeded with cultured embryonic cortical neurons atop an FZ-3/SiNW-FET, the CZn2+ex elevated to  110 x 10-9 m upon stimulation with alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA). Blockers against the AMPA receptor or exocytosis greatly suppress this elevation, indicating that the Zn2+ stored in the synaptic vesicles is the major source responsible for this elevation of CZn2+ex. In addition, a SiNW-FET modified with Abeta could bind Zn2+ with a dissociation constant of  633 x 10-9 m and respond to the Zn2+ released from AMPA-stimulated neurons. Therefore, the CZn2+ex can reach a level high enough to bind Abeta and the Zn2+ homeostasis can be a therapeutic strategy to prevent neurodegeneration.

29770843|t|Patterns and severity of vascular amyloid in Alzheimer's disease associated with duplications and missense mutations in APP gene, Down syndrome and sporadic Alzheimer's disease.
29770843|a|In this study, we have compared the severity of amyloid plaque formation and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and the subtype pattern of CAA pathology itself, between APP genetic causes of AD (APPdup, APP mutations), older individuals with Down syndrome (DS) showing the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and individuals with sporadic (early and late onset) AD (sEOAD and sLOAD, respectively). The aim of this was to elucidate important group differences and to provide mechanistic insights related to clinical and neuropathological phenotypes. Since lipid and cholesterol metabolism is implicated in AD as well as vascular disease, we additionally aimed to explore the role of APOE genotype in CAA severity and subtypes. Plaque formation was greater in DS and missense APP mutations than in APPdup, sEOAD and sLOAD cases. Conversely, CAA was more severe in APPdup and missense APP mutations, and in DS, compared to sEOAD and sLOAD. When stratified by CAA subtype from 1 to 4, there were no differences in plaque scores between the groups, though in patients with APPdup, APP mutations and sEOAD, types 2 and 3 CAA were more common than type 1. Conversely, in DS, sLOAD and controls, type 1 CAA was more common than types 2 and 3. APOE epsilon4 allele frequency was greater in sEOAD and sLOAD compared to APPdup, missense APP mutations, DS and controls, and varied between each of the CAA phenotypes with APOE epsilon4 homozygosity being more commonly associated with type 3 CAA than types 1 and 2 CAA in sLOAD and sEOAD. The differing patterns in CAA within individuals of each group could be a reflection of variations in the efficiency of perivascular drainage, this being less effective in types 2 and 3 CAA leading to a greater burden of CAA in parenchymal arteries and capillaries. Alternatively, as suggested by immunostaining using carboxy-terminal specific antibodies, it may relate to the relative tissue burdens of the two major forms of Abeta, with higher levels of Abeta40 promoting a more 'aggressive' form of CAA, and higher levels of Abeta42(3) favouring a greater plaque burden. Possession of APOE epsilon4 allele, especially epsilon4 homozygosity, favours development of CAA generally, and as type 3 particularly, in sEOAD and sLOAD.

29771464|t|Degradation of amyloid beta peptide by neprilysin expressed from Borna disease virus vector.
29771464|a|Accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta40 and Abeta42) in the brain is a characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Because neprilysin (NEP) is a major Abeta-degrading enzyme, NEP delivery in the brain is a promising gene therapy for AD. Borna disease virus (BoDV) vector enables long-term transduction of foreign genes in the central nerve system. Here, we evaluated the proteolytic ability of NEP transduced by the BoDV vector and found that the amounts of Abeta40 and Abeta42 significantly decreased, which suggests that NEP expressed from the BoDV vector is functional to degrade Abeta.

29771495|t|Rapid Growth of Acetylated Abeta(16-20) into Macroscopic Crystals.
29771495|a|Aberrant assembly of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) is responsible for the development of Alzheimer's disease, but can also be exploited to obtain highly functional biomaterials. The short Abeta fragment, KLVFF (Abeta16-20), is crucial for Abeta assembly and considered to be an Abeta aggregation inhibitor. Here, we show that acetylation of KLVFF turns it into an extremely fast self-assembling molecule, reaching macroscopic ( i.e., mm) size in seconds. We show that KLVFF is metastable and that the self-assembly can be directed toward a crystalline or fibrillar phase simply through chemical modification, via acetylation or amidation of the peptide. Amidated KLVFF can form amyloid fibrils; we observed folding events of such fibrils occurring in as little as 60 ms. The ability of single KLVFF molecules to rapidly assemble as highly ordered macroscopic structures makes it a promising candidate for applications as a rapid-forming templating material.

29772603|t|A novel amyloid designable scaffold and potential inhibitor inspired by GAIIG of amyloid beta and the HIV-1 V3 loop.
29772603|a|The GAIIG sequence, common to the amyloid beta peptide (residues 29-33) and to the HIV-1 gp120 (residues 24-28 in a typical V3 loop), self-assembles into amyloid fibrils, as suggested by theory and the experiments presented here. The longer YATGAIIGNII sequence from the V3 loop also self-assembles into amyloid fibrils, of which the first three and the last two residues are outside the amyloid GAIIG core. We postulate that this sequence, with suitably selected modifications at the flexible positions, can serve as a designable scaffold for novel amyloid-based materials. Moreover, we report the single crystal X-ray structure of the beta-breaker peptide GAIPIG at 1.05 A resolution.

29772745|t|Tryptophan-Containing Dual Neuroprotective Peptides: Prolyl Endopeptidase Inhibition and Caenorhabditis elegans Protection from beta-Amyloid Peptide Toxicity.
29772745|a|Neuroprotective peptides represent an attractive pharmacological strategy for the prevention or treatment of age-related diseases, for which there are currently few effective therapies. Lactoferrin (LF)-derived peptides (PKHs) and a set of six rationally-designed tryptophan (W)-containing heptapeptides (PACEIs) were characterized as prolyl endopeptidase (PEP) inhibitors, and their effect on beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) toxicity in a Caenorhabditis elegans model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) was evaluated. Two LF-derived sequences, PKH8 and PKH11, sharing a W at the C-terminal end, and the six PACEI heptapeptides (PACEI48L to PACEI53L) exhibited significant in vitro PEP inhibition. The inhibitory peptides PKH11 and PACEI50L also alleviated Abeta-induced paralysis in the in vivo C. elegans model of AD. Partial or total loss of the inhibitory effect on PEP was achieved by the substitution of W residues in PKH11 and PACEI50L and correlated with the loss of protection against Abeta toxicity, pointing out the relevance of W on the neuroprotective activity. Further experiments suggest that C. elegans protection might not be mediated by an antioxidant mechanism but rather by inhibition of Abeta oligomerization and thus, amyloid deposition. In conclusion, novel natural and rationally-designed W-containing peptides are suitable starting leads to design effective neuroprotective agents.

29774745|t|Interplay between Copper, Neprilysin, and N-Truncation of beta-Amyloid.
29774745|a|Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with an inefficient clearance of the beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide from the central nervous system. The protein levels and activity of the Zn2+-dependent endopeptidase neprilysin (NEP) inversely correlate with brain Abeta levels during aging and in AD. The present study considered the ability of Cu2+ ions to inhibit human recombinant NEP and the role for NEP in generating N-truncated Abeta fragments with high-affinity Cu2+ binding motifs that can prevent this inhibition. Divalent copper noncompetitively inhibited NEP ( Ki = 1.0 muM),  while proteolysis of Abeta yielded the soluble, Abeta4-9 fragment that can bind Cu2+ with femtomolar affinity at pH 7.4. This provides Abeta4-9 with the potential to act as a Cu2+ carrier and to mediate its own production by preventing NEP inhibition. Enzyme inhibition at high Zn2+ concentrations ( Ki = 20 muM) further suggests a mechanism for modulating NEP activity, Abeta4-9 production, and Cu2+ homeostasis.

29775591|t|Disease-Associated Microglia: A Universal Immune Sensor of Neurodegeneration.
29775591|a|A major challenge in the field of neurodegenerative diseases and brain aging is to identify the body's intrinsic mechanism that could sense the central nervous system (CNS) damage early and protect the brain from neurodegeneration. Accumulating evidence suggests that disease-associated microglia (DAM), a recently identified subset of CNS resident macrophages found at sites of neurodegeneration, might play such a protective role. Here, we propose that microglia are endowed with a dedicated sensory mechanism, which includes the Trem2 signaling pathway, to detect damage within the CNS in the form of neurodegeneration-associated molecular patterns (NAMPs). Combining data from transcriptional analysis of DAM at single-cell level and from human genome-wide association studies (GWASs), we discuss potential function of different DAM pathways in the diseased brain and outline how manipulating DAM may create new therapeutic opportunities.

29777003|t|Impact of Reference and Target Region Selection on Amyloid PET SUV Ratios in the Phase 1b PRIME Study of Aducanumab.
29777003|a|SUV ratios (SUVRs) are commonly used to quantify tracer uptake in amyloid-beta PET. Here, we explore the impact of target and reference region-of-interest (ROI) selection on SUVR effect sizes using interventional data from the ongoing phase 1b PRIME study (NCT01677572) of aducanumab (BIIB037) in patients with prodromal or mild Alzheimer disease. Methods: The florbetapir PET SUVR was calculated at baseline (screening) and at weeks 26 and 54 for patients randomized to receive placebo and each of 4 aducanumab doses (1, 3, 6, and 10 mg/kg) using the whole cerebellum, cerebellar gray matter, cerebellar white matter, pons, and subcortical white matter as reference regions. In addition to the prespecified composite cortex target ROI, individual cerebral cortical ROIs were assessed as targets. Results: Of the reference regions used, subcortical white matter, cerebellar white matter, and the pons, alone or in combination, generated the largest effect sizes. The use of the anterior cingulate cortex as a target ROI resulted in larger effect sizes than the use of the composite cortex. SUVR calculations were not affected by correction for brain volume changes over time. Conclusion: Dose- and time-dependent reductions in the amyloid PET SUVR were consistently observed with aducanumab only in cortical regions prone to amyloid plaque deposition, regardless of the reference region used. These data support the hypothesis that florbetapir SUVR responses associated with aducanumab treatment are a result of specific dose- and time-dependent reductions in the amyloid burden in patients with Alzheimer disease.

29777707|t|Functional analysis of juxta- and intra-membrane domains of murine APP by genome editing in Neuro2a cells.
29777707|a|Amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) correlates with the pathogenesis of certain brain diseases, such as Alzheimer disease (AD). APP is cleaved by several enzymes to produce APP metabolites, including the amyloid beta peptide (Abeta), which accumulates in the brain of AD patients. However, the exact functions of APP metabolites remain elusive. In this study, using genome editing technology, we mutated juxta- and intra-membrane domains of murine APP in the mouse neuroblastoma cell line, Neuro2a. We identified several clones that expressed characteristic patterns of APP metabolites. Mutations in juxta- (deletion 673A), and intra-membrane (deletion 705-6LM) domains of APP, decreased overall levels of APP metabolites or decreased the level of alpha-secretase-cleaved carboxy-terminal fragment (alphaCTF), respectively. APP is known to influence neuronal differentiation; therefore, we used theses clones to dissect the function of APP metabolites during neuronal differentiation. One clone (CA), which expressed reduced levels of both FL-APP and alphaCTF, showed increased expression of the neuronal marker, beta3-tubulin, and enhanced retinoic acid (RA)-induced neurite outgrowth. In contrast, a clone that expressed FL-APP, but was devoid of alphaCTF (CE), showed comparable expression of beta3-tubulin and neurite outgrowth compared with normal Neuro2a cells. These data indicate that FL-APP is a suppressor of neurite outgrowth. Our data suggest a novel regulatory function of juxta- and intra-membrane domains on the metabolism and function of APP.

29782313|t|Kainic Acid Impairs the Memory Behavior of APP23 Mice by Increasing Brain Amyloid Load through a Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha-Dependent Mechanism.
29782313|a|Kainic acid (KA) was recently identified as an epileptogenic and neuroexcitotoxic agent that is responsible for inducing learning and memory deficits in various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanism by which KA acts upon AD remains unclear. To this end, we presently investigated the roles of KA in processing amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) and amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) loads during the course of AD development and progression. Specifically, KA treatment clearly caused the upregulation of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) via activation of the PI3-K/AKT, ERK1/2, and p65 pathways in glial cells. TNF-alpha secreted from glial cells was then found to be responsible for stimulating the expression of BACE-1 and PS1/2, which resulted in the production and deposition of Abeta in neurons. Finally, the accumulation and aggregation of Abeta lead to the cognitive decline of APP23 mice. These results indicate that KA accelerates the progression of AD by inducing the crosstalk between glial cells and neurons.

29782833|t|Insights into Stabilizing Forces in Amyloid Fibrils of Differing Sizes from Polarizable Molecular Dynamics Simulations.
29782833|a|Pathological aggregation of amyloid-forming proteins is a hallmark of a number of human diseases, including Alzheimer's, type 2 diabetes, Parkinson's, and more. Despite having very different primary amino acid sequences, these amyloid proteins form similar supramolecular, fibril structures that are highly resilient to physical and chemical denaturation. To better understand the structural stability of disease-related amyloids and to gain a greater understanding of factors that stabilize functional amyloid assemblies, insights into tertiary and quaternary interactions are needed. We performed molecular dynamics simulations on human tau, amyloid-beta, and islet amyloid polypeptide fibrils to determine key physicochemical properties that give rise to their unique characteristics and fibril structures. These simulations are the first of their kind in employing a polarizable force field to explore properties of local electric fields on dipole properties and other electrostatic forces that contribute to amyloid stability. Across these different amyloid fibrils, we focused on how the underlying forces stabilize fibrils to elucidate the driving forces behind the protein aggregation. The polarizable model allows for an investigation of how side-chain dipole moments, properties of structured water molecules in the fibril core, and the local environment around salt bridges contribute to the formation of interfaces essential for fibril stability. By systematically studying three amyloidogenic proteins of various fibril sizes for key structural properties and stabilizing forces, we shed light on properties of amyloid structures related to both diseased and functional states at the atomistic level.

29789140|a|The presence of pre-existing natural antibodies against Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathological proteins might interfere with immune responses to therapeutic vaccination with these proteins. We aimed to compare levels of antibodies in CSF and serum: We observed higher reactivity of natural tau-reactive antibodies towards phosphorylated bovine tau protein than to human recombinant (non-phosphorylated) tau protein. Males with MCI-AD had higher amounts of these antibodies than corresponding controls. Concentrations of antibodies were lower in females with the MCI-AD than in control females. These findings may have implications for tau vaccination trials.

29789640|t|Alterations in serum kynurenine pathway metabolites in individuals with high neocortical amyloid-beta load: A pilot study.
29789640|a|The kynurenine pathway (KP) is dysregulated in neuroinflammatory diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), however has not been investigated in preclinical AD characterized by high neocortical amyloid-beta load (NAL), prior to cognitive impairment. Serum KP metabolites were measured in the cognitively normal KARVIAH cohort. Participants, aged 65-90 y, were categorised into NAL+ (n = 35) and NAL- (n = 65) using a standard uptake value ratio cut-off = 1.35. Employing linear models adjusting for age and APOEepsilon4, higher kynurenine and anthranilic acid (AA) in NAL+ versus NAL- participants were observed in females (kynurenine, p = 0.004; AA, p = 0.001) but not males (NALxGender, p = 0.001, 0.038, respectively). To evaluate the predictive potential of kynurenine or/and AA for NAL+ in females, logistic regressions with NAL+/- as outcome were carried out. After age and APOEepsilon4 adjustment, kynurenine and AA were individually and jointly significant predictors (p = 0.007, 0.005, 0.0004, respectively). Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were 0.794 using age and APOEepsilon4 as predictors, and 0.844, 0.866 and 0.871 when kynurenine, AA and both were added. Findings from the current study exhibit increased KP activation in NAL+ females and highlight the predictive potential of KP metabolites, AA and kynurenine, for NAL+. Additionally, the current study also provides insight into he influence of gender in AD pathogenesis.

29792528|t|Dissociation of cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta and tau levels in patients with prolonged posttraumatic disorders of consciousness.
29792528|a|BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although the mechanisms that lead to AD after a TBI are unclear, we hypothesize that changes in amyloid-beta (Abeta) metabolism and abnormal tau phosphorylation are reasonable candidates. OBJECTIVE: To investigate Abeta and tau dynamics in the chronic phase of TBI. METHODS: We evaluated Abeta1-42, total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 15 patients who developed a prolonged disorder of consciousness after a severe TBI (mean time from TBI 271.6 +- 176.5 days). RESULTS: Reduced Abeta1-42 levels (median 258 pg/ml, range 90-833.6) were observed in 14/15 patients (93.3%) with severe post-TBI disorders of consciousness. These CSF analysis data did not correlate with time since TBI or with the patients' level of consciousness as determined by the Coma Recovery Scale Revised. Normal t-tau levels (median 95.2 pg/ml, range 52-256.9) were found in all patients. Normal p-tau levels (median 22.2 pg/ml, range 14-72) were observed in 14/15 patients, with just a single patient having a slightly increased p-tau level. CONCLUSION: The present findings show that Abeta and tau are differently affected in the chronic phase of severe TBI.

29792870|t|Peripheral complement interactions with amyloid beta peptide in Alzheimer's disease: Polymorphisms, structure, and function of complement receptor 1.
29792870|a|INTRODUCTION: Genome-wide association studies consistently show that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the complement receptor 1 (CR1) gene modestly but significantly alter Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. Follow-up research has assumed that CR1 is expressed in the human brain despite a paucity of evidence for its function there. Alternatively, erythrocytes contain >80% of the body's CR1, where, in primates, it is known to bind circulating pathogens. METHODS: Multidisciplinary methods were employed. RESULTS: Conventional Western blots and quantitative polymerase chain reaction failed to detect CR1 in the human brain. Brain immunohistochemistry revealed only vascular CR1. By contrast, erythrocyte CR1 immunoreactivity was readily observed and was significantly deficient in AD, as was CR1-mediated erythrocyte capture of circulating amyloid beta peptide. CR1 SNPs associated with decreased erythrocyte CR1 increased AD risk, whereas a CR1 SNP associated with increased erythrocyte CR1 decreased AD risk. DISCUSSION: SNP effects on erythrocyte CR1 likely underlie the association of CR1 polymorphisms with AD risk.

29793416|t|Oleanolic Acid Ameliorates Abeta25-35 Injection-induced Memory Deficit in Alzheimer's Disease Model Rats by Maintaining Synaptic Plasticity.
29793416|a|BACKGROUND: Abnormal amyloid beta (Abeta) accumulation and deposition in the hippocampus is an essential process in Alzheimer's disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether Oleanolic acid (OA) could improve memory deficit in AD model and its possible mechanism. METHODS: Forty-five SD rats were randomly divided into sham operation group, model group, and OA group. AD models by injection of Abeta25-35 were built. Morris water maze (MWM) was applied to investigate learning and memory, transmission electron microscope (TEM) to observe the ultrastructure of synapse, western blot to the proteins, electrophysiology for long-term potentiation (LTP), and Ca2+ concentration in synapse was also measured. RESULTS: The latency time in model group was significantly longer than that in sham operation group (P=0.0001); while it was significantly shorter in the OA group than that in model group (P=0.0001); compared with model group, the times of cross-platform in OA group significantly increased (P=0.0001). TEM results showed OA could alleviate neuron damage and synapses changes induced by Abeta25-35. The expressions of CaMKII, PKC, NMDAR2B, BDNF, TrkB, and CREB protein were significantly improved by OA (P=0.0001, 0.036, 0.041, 0.0001, 0.0001, 0.026, respectively) compared with that in model group; the concentration of Ca2+ was significantly lower in OA group (1.11+-0.42) than that in model group (1.68+-0.18); and the slope rate (P=0.0001) and amplitude (P=0.0001) of f- EPSP significantly increased in OA group. CONCLUSION: The present results support that OA could ameliorate Abeta-induced memory loss of AD rats by maintaining synaptic plasticity of the hippocampus.

29799975|t|Amyloid-beta (1-40) and Mortality in Patients With Non-ST-Segment Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome: A Cohort Study.
29799975|a|Background: Amyloid-beta (1-40) (Abeta40) is implicated in mechanisms related to plaque destabilization and correlates with adverse outcomes in stable coronary artery disease. Objective: To determine the prognostic and reclassification value of baseline circulating levels of Abeta40 after adjustment for the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) score, which is widely recommended for risk stratification in non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS). Design: Retrospective cohort study using data from 2 independent prospective cohorts, the Heidelberg study (n = 1145) and the validation multicenter international APACE (Advantageous Predictors of Acute Coronary Syndrome Evaluation) study (n = 734). Setting: Academic hospitals in 7 European countries. Participants: Patients with adjudicated NSTE-ACS followed for a median of 21.9 and 24.9 months in the Heidelberg and APACE studies, respectively. Measurements: All-cause mortality was the primary end point. Results: Amyloid-beta (1-40) was associated with mortality after multivariate adjustment for age, sex, diabetes mellitus, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T and C-reactive protein, revascularization, and ACS type (Heidelberg cohort hazard ratio [HR] for 80th vs. 20th percentiles, 1.66 [95% CI, 1.06 to 2.61; P = 0.026]; APACE cohort HR, 1.50 [CI, 1.15 to 1.96; P = 0.003]). It was also associated with mortality after adjustment for the GRACE score (Heidelberg cohort HR for 80th vs. 20th percentiles, 1.11 [CI, 1.04 to 1.18; P = 0.001]; APACE cohort HR, 1.39 [CI, 1.02 to 1.88; P = 0.036]). Amyloid-beta (1-40) correctly reclassified risk for death over the GRACE score (net reclassification index, 33.4% and 47.1% for the Heidelberg and APACE cohorts, respectively) (P < 0.05). Limitation: At low concentrations of Abeta40, dose-response associations with mortality differed between cohorts, possibly because of varying blood preparations used to measure Abeta40. Conclusion: Circulating Abeta40 is a predictor of mortality and improves risk stratification of patients with NSTE-ACS over the GRACE score recommended by clinical guidelines. The clinical application of Abeta40 as a novel biomarker in NSTE-ACS should be further explored and validated. Primary Funding Source: German Cardiac Society.

29799986|t|Interactive Associations of Vascular Risk and beta-Amyloid Burden With Cognitive Decline in Clinically Normal Elderly Individuals: Findings From the Harvard Aging Brain Study.
29799986|a|Importance: Identifying asymptomatic individuals at high risk of impending cognitive decline because of Alzheimer disease is crucial for successful prevention of dementia. Vascular risk and beta-amyloid (Abeta) pathology commonly co-occur in older adults and are significant causes of cognitive impairment. Objective: To determine whether vascular risk and Abeta burden act additively or synergistically to promote cognitive decline in clinically normal older adults; and, secondarily, to evaluate the unique influence of vascular risk on prospective cognitive decline beyond that of commonly used imaging biomarkers, including Abeta burden, hippocampal volume, fludeoxyglucose F18-labeled (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET), and white matter hyperintensities, a marker of cerebrovascular disease. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this longitudinal observational study, we examined clinically normal older adults from the Harvard Aging Brain Study. Participants were required to have baseline imaging data (FDG-PET, Abeta-PET, and magnetic resonance imaging), baseline medical data to quantify vascular risk, and at least 1 follow-up neuropsychological visit. Data collection began in 2010 and is ongoing. Data analysis was performed on data collected between 2010 and 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: Vascular risk was quantified using the Framingham Heart Study general cardiovascular disease (FHS-CVD) risk score. We measured Abeta burden with Pittsburgh Compound-B PET. Cognition was measured annually with the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite. Models were corrected for baseline age, sex, years of education, and apolipoprotein E epsilon4 status. Results: Of the 223 participants, 130 (58.3%) were women. The mean (SD) age was 73.7 (6.0) years, and the mean (SD) follow-up time was 3.7 (1.2) years. Faster cognitive decline was associated with both a higher FHS-CVD risk score (beta = -0.064; 95% CI, -0.094 to -0.033; P < .001) and higher Abeta burden (beta = -0.058; 95% CI, -0.079 to -0.037; P < .001). The interaction of the FHS-CVD risk score and Abeta burden with time was significant (beta = -0.040, 95% CI, -0.062 to -0.018; P < .001), suggesting a synergistic effect. The FHS-CVD risk score remained robustly associated with prospective cognitive decline (beta = -0.055; 95% CI, -0.086 to -0.024; P < .001), even after adjustment for Abeta burden, hippocampal volume, FDG-PET uptake, and white matter hyperintensities. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, vascular risk was associated with prospective cognitive decline in clinically normal older adults, both alone and synergistically with Abeta burden. Vascular risk may complement imaging biomarkers in assessing risk of prospective cognitive decline in preclinical Alzheimer disease.

29803148|t|Abeta dimers induce behavioral and neurochemical deficits of relevance to early Alzheimer's disease.
29803148|a|We examined behaviors and neurotransmitter levels in the tgDimer mouse, a model for early Alzheimer's disease, that expresses exclusively soluble amyloid beta (Abeta) dimers and is devoid of Abeta plaques, astrogliosis, and neuroinflammation. Seven-month-old mice were subjected to tests of motor activity, attention, anxiety, habituation learning, working memory, and depression-related behaviors. They were impaired in nonselective attention and motor learning and showed anxiety- and despair-related behaviors. In 7- and 12-month-old mice, levels of acetylcholine, dopamine, and serotonin were measured in neostriatum, ventral striatum, prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and entorhinal cortex by high-performance liquid chromatography. The tgDimer mice had lower serotonin turnover rates in hippocampus, ventral striatum, and amygdala relative to wild type controls. The aged tgDimer mice had less hippocampal acetylcholine than adult tgDimers. Stress-test results, based on corticosterone levels, indicated an intact hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis in 12-month-old mice. Since neither Abeta plaques nor astrogliosis or neuroinflammation was responsible for these phenotypes, we conclude that Abeta dimers contribute to neurotransmitter dysfunction and behavioral impairments, characteristic for the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.

29804308|t|Reduced Abeta secretion by human neurons under conditions of strongly increased BACE activity.
29804308|a|The initial step in the amyloidogenic cascade of amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing is catalyzed by beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE), and this protease has increased activities in affected areas of Alzheimer's disease brains. We hypothesized that altered APP processing, because of augmented BACE activity, would affect the actions of direct and indirect BACE inhibitors. We therefore compared post-mitotic human neurons (LUHMES) with their BACE-overexpressing counterparts (BLUHMES). Although beta-cleavage of APP was strongly increased in BLUHMES, they produced less full-length and truncated amyloid beta (Abeta) than LUHMES. Moreover, low concentrations of BACE inhibitors decreased cellular BACE activity as expected, but increased Abeta1-40 levels. Several other approaches to modulate BACE activity led to a similar, apparently paradoxical, behavior. For instance, reduction in intracellular acidification by bepridil increased Abeta production in parallel with decreased BACE activity. In contrast to BLUHMES, the respective control cells (LUHMES or BLUHMES with catalytically inactive BACE) showed conventional pharmacological responses. Other non-canonical neurochemical responses (so-called 'rebound effects') are well-documented for the Abeta pathway, especially for gamma-secretase: a partial block of its activity leads to an increased Abeta secretion by some cell types. We therefore compared LUHMES and BLUHMES regarding rebound effects of gamma-secretase inhibitors and found an Abeta rise in LUHMES but not in BLUHMES. Thus, different cellular factors are responsible for the gamma-secretase- versus BACE-related Abeta rebound. We conclude that increased BACE activity, possibly accompanied by an altered cellular localization pattern, can dramatically influence Abeta generation in human neurons and affect pharmacological responses to secretase inhibitors.

29807333|t|Structure-activity relationships of beta-hairpin mimics as modulators of amyloid beta-peptide aggregation.
29807333|a|Aggregation of amyloid proteins is currently involved in more than 20 serious human diseases that are actually untreated, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite many efforts made to target the amyloid cascade in AD, finding an aggregation inhibiting compound and especially modulating early oligomerization remains a relevant and challenging strategy. We report herein the first examples of small and non-peptide mimics of acyclic beta-hairpins, showing an ability to delay the fibrillization of amyloid-beta (Abeta1-42) peptide and deeply modify its early oligomerization process. Modifications providing better druggability properties such as increased hydrophilicity and reduced peptidic character were performed. We also demonstrate that an appropriate balance between flexibility and stability of the beta-hairpin must be reached to adapt to the different shape of the various aggregated forms of the amyloid peptide. This strategy can be investigated to target other challenging amyloid proteins.

29812922|t|Generalized Markov State Modeling Method for Nonequilibrium Biomolecular Dynamics: Exemplified on Amyloid beta Conformational Dynamics Driven by an Oscillating Electric Field.
29812922|a|Markov state models (MSMs) have received an unabated increase in popularity in recent years, as they are very well suited for the identification and analysis of metastable states and related kinetics. However, the state-of-the-art Markov state modeling methods and tools enforce the fulfillment of a detailed balance condition, restricting their applicability to equilibrium MSMs. To date, they are unsuitable to deal with general dominant data structures including cyclic processes, which are essentially associated with nonequilibrium systems. To overcome this limitation, we developed a generalization of the common robust Perron Cluster Cluster Analysis (PCCA+) method, termed generalized PCCA (G-PCCA). This method handles equilibrium and nonequilibrium simulation data, utilizing Schur vectors instead of eigenvectors. G-PCCA is not limited to the detection of metastable states but enables the identification of dominant structures in a general sense, unraveling cyclic processes. This is exemplified by application of G-PCCA on nonequilibrium molecular dynamics data of the Amyloid beta (1-40) peptide, periodically driven by an oscillating electric field.

29843242|t|A Clinicopathological Investigation of White Matter Hyperintensities and Alzheimer's Disease Neuropathology.
29843242|a|BACKGROUND: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been postulated to be a core feature of Alzheimer's disease. Clinicopathological studies are needed to elucidate and confirm this possibility. OBJECTIVE: This study examined: 1) the association between antemortem WMH and autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer's disease neuropathology (ADNP), 2) the relationship between WMH and dementia in participants with ADNP, and 3) the relationships among cerebrovascular disease, WMH, and ADNP. METHODS: The sample included 82 participants from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center's Data Sets who had quantitated volume of WMH from antemortem FLAIR MRI and available neuropathological data. The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale (from MRI visit) operationalized dementia status. ADNP+ was defined by moderate to frequent neuritic plaques and Braak stage III-VI at autopsy. Cerebrovascular disease neuropathology included infarcts or lacunes, microinfarcts, arteriolosclerosis, atherosclerosis, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. RESULTS: 60/82 participants were ADNP+. Greater volume of WMH predicted increased odds for ADNP (p = 0.037). In ADNP+ participants, greater WMH corresponded with increased odds for dementia (CDR>=1; p = 0.038). WMH predicted cerebral amyloid angiopathy, microinfarcts, infarcts, and lacunes (ps < 0.04). ADNP+ participants were more likely to have moderate-severe arteriolosclerosis and cerebral amyloid angiopathy compared to ADNP-participants (ps < 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: This study found a direct association between total volume of WMH and increased odds for having ADNP. In patients with Alzheimer's disease, FLAIR MRI WMH may be able to provide key insight into disease severity and progression. The association between WMH and ADNP may be explained by underlying cerebrovascular disease.

29843688|t|Huatuo Zaizao pill ameliorates cognitive impairment of APP/PS1 transgenic mice by improving synaptic plasticity and reducing Abeta deposition.
29843688|a|BACKGROUND: It is well known that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by memory deficits and cognitive decline. Amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition and synaptic dysfunction play important roles in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The Huatuo Zaizao pill (HT) is a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) that has been used clinically for many years in China, mainly for post-stroke rehabilitation and cognitive decline; however, the mechanism of cognitive function is not clear. In this study, we investigated the effect of HT on hippocampal synaptic function, Amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition in APP/PS1 AD transgenic mice. METHOD: Six-month-old APP/PS1 transgenic (Tg) mice were randomly divided into control, HT-treated, and memantine (MEM)-treated groups. Then, these groups were orally administered vehicle (for the control), HT (0.25 g/kg) and MEM (5 mg/kg) respectively for 4 weeks. The Morris water maze, Novel Object Recognition, and Open field tests were used to assess cognitive behavioral changes. We evaluated the effects of HT on neuronal excitability, membrane ion channel activity, and synaptic plasticity in acute hippocampal slices by combining electrophysiological extracellular tests. Synaptic morphology in the hippocampus was investigated by electron microscopy. Western blotting was used to assess synaptic-associated protein and Abeta production and degrading levels. Immunofluorescence staining was used to determine the relative integrated density. RESULTS: HT can ameliorate hippocampus-dependent memory deficits and improve synaptic dysfunction by reversing LTP impairment in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Moreover, HT reduces amyloid plaque deposition by regulating alpha-secretase and gamma-secretase levels. CONCLUSION: HT can improve the learning and memory function of APP/PS1 transgenic mice by improving synaptic function and reducing amyloid plaque deposition.

29844375|t|Induction of ganglioside synthesis in Drosophila brain accelerates assembly of amyloid beta protein.
29844375|a|The assembly and deposition of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) is a fundamental event during the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. A growing body of evidence indicates that gangliosides form a pathological platform for the generation of ganglioside-bound Abeta, which facilitates the assembly of soluble Abetas; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the binding of Abeta to gangliosides in the brain remain unclear due to the lack of an in vivo system that may address this issue. In insects, including the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, gangliosides are not intrinsically present at a detectable level. We herein demonstrate that ganglioside expression is inducible in Drosophila via the expression of transgenes of ganglioside synthesis enzymes and the feeding of exogenous sialic acid, and also that the induction of ganglioside synthesis significantly accelerates Abeta assembly in vivo. Our results support the hypothesis that gangliosides are responsible for Abeta assembly in vivo and also provide an opportunity to develop a valuable model for basic research as well as a therapeutic strategy for AD.

29848690|t|Amyloid-beta Interactions with ABC Transporters and Resistance Modifiers.
29848690|a|BACKGROUND/AIM: Failure of cancer chemotherapy caused by multidrug resistance (MDR) of tumor cells is mediated by ABC transporters that reduce the uptake of cytotoxic agents. Similar transporters are responsible for amyloid clearance in nerve cells in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of this study was to compare the biological effects of amyloid complexes of some known ABC transporter inhibitors e.g. disiloxanes. One of the most active fragments of the pathological "endogen" substrate responsible for AD was investigated in the presence of amyloid-beta fragment on the reversal of multidrug resistance and apoptosis induction on multidrug-resistant tumor cells in model experiments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The efflux pump activity of the cells treated with amyloid-beta complexes was studied by Rhodamin-123 accumulation. Apoptosis induction was measured by staining of treated cells by Annexin-V and propidium iodine. The fluorescent activity FL-1 and FL-2 of the cells was measured and analyzed on a PARTEC FACScan instrument. RESULTS: The resistance modifiers: disiloxanes and memantine complexed with amyloid-beta 1-42 reduced the activity of ABC transporter in MDR tumor cells. Early apoptosis was moderately increased by amyloid-beta complexes. Late apoptosis and the number of total viable cells were not changed. CONCLUSION: Amyloid-beta and its complexes inactivate the efflux pump of tumor cells resulting in accumulation of amyloid. It is supposed that reduced membrane transport can explain the lower incidence of cancer in AD.

29848798|t|Microwave-induced formation of oligomeric amyloid aggregates.
29848798|a|Amyloid aggregates have emerged as a significant hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Although it has been recently reported that microwave heating induces amyloid aggregation compared with conventional heating methods, the mechanism of amyloid aggregate induction has remained unclear. In this study, we investigated the formation of oligomeric amyloid aggregates (OAAs) by microwave irradiation at microscale volumes of solution. Microwave irradiation of protein monomer solution triggered rapid formation of OAAs within 7 min. We characterized the formation of OAAs using atomic force microscopy, thioflavin T fluorescent assay and circular dichroism. In the microwave system, we also investigated the inhibitory effect on the formation of amyloid aggregates by L-ascorbic acid as well as enhanced amyloid aggregation by silver nanomaterials such as nanoparticles and nanowires. We believe that microwave technology has the potential to facilitate the study of amyloid aggregation in the presence of chemical agents or nanomaterials.

29850758|a|Herein we report that a preferable inhibition of the nucleation phase of Abeta42, related to the formation of toxic oligomers, by triterpenoids from medicinal herbs originates from a salt bridge of their carboxy groups with Lys16 and 28 in Abeta42. Such a direct interaction targeting the monomer, dimer, and trimer suppressed further oligomerization. In contrast, the corresponding congeners without carboxy groups failed to do so.

29853653|t|Antibody-Based In Vivo PET Imaging Detects Amyloid-beta Reduction in Alzheimer Transgenic Mice After BACE-1 Inhibition.
29853653|a|Visualization of amyloid-beta (Abeta) pathology with PET has become an important tool for making a specific clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD). However, the available amyloid PET radioligands, such as 11C-Pittsburgh compound B, reflect levels of insoluble Abeta plaques but do not capture soluble and protofibrillar Abeta forms. Furthermore, the plaque load appears to be fairly static during clinical stages of AD and may not be affected by Abeta-reducing treatments. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether a novel PET radioligand based on an antibody directed toward soluble aggregates of Abeta can be used to detect changes in Abeta levels during disease progression and after treatment with a beta-secretase (BACE-1) inhibitor. Methods: One set of transgenic mice (tg-ArcSwe, a model of Abeta pathology) aged between 7 and 16 mo underwent PET with the Abeta protofibril-selective radioligand 124I-RmAb158-scFv8D3 (where RmAb is recombinant mouse monoclonal antibody and scFv is single-chain variable fragment) to follow progression of Abeta pathology in the brain. A second set of tg-ArcSwe mice, aged 10 mo, were treated with the BACE-1 inhibitor NB-360 for 3 mo and compared with an untreated control group. A third set of tg-ArcSwe mice, also aged 10 mo, underwent PET as a baseline group. Brain tissue was isolated after PET to determine levels of Abeta by ELISA and immunohistochemistry. Results: The concentration of 124I-RmAb158-scFv8D3, as measured in vivo with PET, increased with age and corresponded well with the ex vivo autoradiography and Abeta immunohistochemistry results. Mice treated with NB-360 showed significantly lower in vivo PET signals than untreated animals and were similar to the baseline animals. The decreased 124I-RmAb158-scFv8D3 concentrations in NB-360-treated mice, as quantified with PET, corresponded well with the decreased Abeta levels measured in postmortem brain. Conclusion: Several treatments for AD are in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, but the possibility of studying treatment effects in vivo on the important, nonfibrillar, forms of Abeta is limited. This study demonstrated the ability of the Abeta protofibril-selective radioligand 124I-RmAb158-scFv8D3 to follow disease progression and detect treatment effects with PET imaging in tg-ArcSwe mice.

29856605|t|Multimodal Chemical Imaging of Amyloid Plaque Polymorphism Reveals Abeta Aggregation Dependent Anionic Lipid Accumulations and Metabolism.
29856605|a|Amyloid plaque formation constitutes one of the main pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is suggested to be a critical factor driving disease pathogenesis. Interestingly, in patients that display amyloid pathology but remain cognitively normal, Abeta deposits are predominantly of diffuse morphology suggesting that cored plaque formation is primarily associated with cognitive deterioration and AD pathogenesis. Little is known about the molecular mechanism responsible for conversion of monomeric Abeta into neurotoxic aggregates and the predominantly cored deposits observed in AD. The structural diversity among Abeta plaques, including cored/compact- and diffuse, may be linked to their distinct Abeta profile and other chemical species including neuronal lipids. We developed a novel, chemical imaging paradigm combining matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI IMS) and fluorescent amyloid staining. This multimodal imaging approach was used to probe the lipid chemistry associated with structural plaque heterogeneity in transgenic AD mice (tgAPPSwe) and was correlated to Abeta profiles determined by subsequent laser microdissection and immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry. Multivariate image analysis revealed an inverse localization of ceramides and their matching metabolites to diffuse and cored structures within single plaques, respectively. Moreover, phosphatidylinositols implicated in AD pathogenesis, were found to localize to the diffuse Abeta structures and correlate with Abeta1-42. Further, lysophospholipids implicated in neuroinflammation were increased in all Abeta deposits. The results support previous clinical findings on the importance of lipid disturbances in AD pathophysiology and associated sphingolipid processing. These data highlight the potential of multimodal imaging as a powerful technology to probe neuropathological mechanisms.

29856989|t|Abeta1-42 oligomer induces alteration of tight junction scaffold proteins via RAGE-mediated autophagy in bEnd.3 cells.
29856989|a|Compelling evidences have shown that amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide is one of the major pathogenic factors resulting in blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanism underlying BBB breakdown remains elusive. In our present study, we employed murine brain capillary endothelial cells (bEnd.3) as an in vitro BBB model to investigate the role of autophagy in Abeta1-42 oligo induced BBB disruption. We first identified Abeta1-42 oligo cytotoxicity to bEnd.3 cells as observed in the reduced cell viability and downregulation of ZO-1, Occludin and Claudin-5. Based on the observation that both downregulated expression of p-mTOR/m-TOR and upregulated ratio of LC3-II/beta-actin were induced by Abeta1-42 oligo, we then applied 3-MA, an inhibitor of autophagy, to test the role of autophagy in Abeta1-42 oligo induced Tight junction (TJ) proteins damage. Results have shown that 3-MA partially reversed Abeta1-42 oligo induced downregulation of ZO-1, Occludin and Claudin-5, which was further determined by LC3 siRNA. We also used rapamycin to activate autophagy and found that TJ proteins damage induced by Abeta1-42 was deteriorated even further. Given that the receptor of advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) is a pivotal receptor that mediates Abeta toxicity, RAGE siRNA was utilized to identify the involvement of RAGE in Abeta1-42 oligo induced autophagy. The results demonstrated a suppressed autophagy with increased p-mTOR/m-TOR and decreased LC3-II/beta-actin as well as increased ZO-1, Occludin and Claudin-5 in transfected cells after Abeta1-42 oligo treatment, as compared to the non-transfected group. In summary, these results suggested that Abeta1-42 oligo induced TJ proteins disruption via a RAGE-dependent autophagy pathway.

29858078|t|CRISPR/Cas9 Mediated Disruption of the Swedish APP Allele as a Therapeutic Approach for Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease.
29858078|a|The APPswe (Swedish) mutation in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene causes dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a result of increased beta-secretase cleavage of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) precursor protein. This leads to abnormally high Abeta levels, not only in brain but also in peripheral tissues of mutation carriers. Here, we selectively disrupted the human mutant APPSW allele using CRISPR. By applying CRISPR/Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes, we generated allele-specific deletions of either APPSW or APPWT. As measured by ELISA, conditioned media of targeted patient-derived fibroblasts displayed an approximate 60% reduction in secreted Abeta. Next, coding sequences for the APPSW-specific guide RNA (gRNA) and Cas9 were packaged into separate adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors. Site-specific indel formation was achieved both in primary neurons isolated from APPSW transgenic mouse embryos (Tg2576) and after co-injection of these vectors into hippocampus of adult mice. Taken together, we here present proof-of-concept data that CRISPR/Cas9 can selectively disrupt the APPSW allele both ex vivo and in vivo-and thereby decrease pathogenic Abeta. Hence, this system may have the potential to be developed as a tool for gene therapy against AD caused by APPswe and other point mutations associated with increased Abeta.

29858247|t|Full-length amyloid precursor protein regulates lipoprotein metabolism and amyloid-beta clearance in human astrocytes.
29858247|a|Mounting evidence suggests that alterations in cholesterol homeostasis are involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) or multiple fragments generated by proteolytic processing of APP have previously been implicated in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism. However, the physiological function of APP in regulating lipoprotein homeostasis in astrocytes, which are responsible for de novo cholesterol biosynthesis and regulation in the brain, remains unclear. To address this, here we used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to generate isogenic APP-knockout (KO) human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and differentiated them into human astrocytes. We found that APP-KO astrocytes have reduced cholesterol and elevated levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) target gene transcripts and proteins, which were both downstream consequences of reduced lipoprotein endocytosis. To elucidate which APP fragments regulate cholesterol homeostasis and to examine whether familial AD mutations in APP affect lipoprotein metabolism, we analyzed an isogenic allelic series harboring the APP Swedish and APP V717F variants. Only astrocytes homozygous for the APP Swedish (APPSwe/Swe) mutation, which had reduced full-length APP (FL APP) due to increased beta-secretase cleavage, recapitulated the APP-KO phenotypes. Astrocytic internalization of beta-amyloid (Abeta), another ligand for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, was also impaired in APP-KO and APPSwe/Swe astrocytes. Finally, impairing cleavage of FL APP through beta-secretase inhibition in APPSwe/Swe astrocytes reversed the LDL and Abeta endocytosis defects. In conclusion, FL APP is involved in the endocytosis of LDL receptor ligands and is required for proper cholesterol homeostasis and Abeta clearance in human astrocytes.

29859866|t|Latent classes of mild cognitive impairment are associated with clinical outcomes and neuropathology: Analysis of data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center.
29859866|a|Given the importance of identifying prodromes of dementia with specific etiologies, we assessed whether seven latent classes of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), defined empirically based on cognitive, functional, and neuropsychiatric information at initial visit, are associated with distinct clinical outcomes and neuropathological features. We separated 6034 participants with a baseline diagnosis of MCI into seven latent classes using previously defined criteria. We found that these latent classes of MCI differed significantly in their clinical outcomes, survival time, and neuropathology. Two amnestic multi-domain subgroups, as well as two other subgroups with functional impairments and neuropsychiatric disturbances, were at higher risk of not only a 'pure' form of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, but also a 'mixed' pathology consisting of both AD and vascular features. Moreover, the seven latent classes had different risks of Lewy bodies, hippocampal sclerosis, and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). This study indicates that data-driven subgroups of MCI are clinicopathologically informative and, with refinement, could lead to targeted interventions focused on each etiology.

29859874|t|Newfound effect of N-acetylaspartate in preventing and reversing aggregation of amyloid-beta in vitro.
29859874|a|Although N-acetylaspartate (NAA) has long been recognized as the most abundant amino acid in neurons by far, its primary role has remained a mystery. Based on its unique tertiary structure, we explored the potential of NAA to modulate aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide 1-42 via multiple corroborating aggregation assays along with electron microscopy. Thioflavin-T fluorescence assay demonstrated that at physiological concentrations, NAA substantially inhibited the initiation of Abeta fibril formation. In addition, NAA added after 25 min of Abeta aggregation was shown to break up preformed fibrils. Electron microscopy analysis confirmed the absence of mature fibrils following NAA treatment. Furthermore, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering measurements confirmed significant reductions in Abeta fibril hydrodynamic radius following treatment with NAA. These results suggest that physiological levels of NAA could play an important role in controlling Abeta aggregation in vivo where they are both found in the same neuronal compartments.

29860028|t|Establishment of Constraints on Amyloid Formation Imposed by Steric Exclusion of Globular Domains.
29860028|a|In many disease-related and functional amyloids, the amyloid-forming regions of proteins are flanked by globular domains. When located in close vicinity of the amyloid regions along the chain, the globular domains can prevent the formation of amyloids because of the steric repulsion. Experimental tests of this effect are few in number and non-systematic, and their interpretation is hampered by polymorphism of amyloid structures. In this situation, modeling approaches that use such a clear-cut criterion as the steric tension can give us highly trustworthy results. In this work, we evaluated this steric effect by using molecular modeling and dynamics. As an example, we tested hybrid proteins containing an amyloid-forming fragment of Abeta peptide (17-42) linked to one or two globular domains of GFP. Searching for the shortest possible linker, we constructed models with pseudo-helical arrangements of the densely packed GFPs around the Abeta amyloid core. The molecular modeling showed that linkers of 7 and more residues allow fibrillogenesis of the Abeta-peptide flanked by GFP on one side and 18 and more residues when Abeta-peptide is flanked by GFPs on both sides. Furthermore, we were able to establish a more general relationship between the size of the globular domains and the length of the linkers by using analytical expressions and rigid body simulations. Our results will find use in planning and interpretation of experiments, improvement of the prediction of amyloidogenic regions in proteins, and design of new functional amyloids carrying globular domains.

Previous genome-wide association studies of imaging-derived biomarkers in sporadic late-onset Alzheimer's disease focused only on phenotypes derived from single imaging modalities. In contrast, we computed a novel multi-modal neuroimaging phenotype comprising cortical amyloid burden and bilateral hippocampal volume. Both imaging biomarkers were used as input to a disease progression modelling algorithm, which estimates the biomarkers' long-term evolution curves from population-based longitudinal data. Among other parameters, the algorithm computes the shift in time required to optimally align a subjects' biomarker trajectories with these population curves. This time shift serves as a disease progression score and it was used as a quantitative trait in a discovery genome-wide association study with n = 944 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database diagnosed as Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment or healthy at the time of imaging. We identified a genome-wide significant locus implicating LCORL (rs6850306, chromosome 4; P = 1.03 x 10-8). The top variant rs6850306 was found to act as an expression quantitative trait locus for LCORL in brain tissue. The clinical role of rs6850306 in conversion from healthy ageing to mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease was further validated in an independent cohort comprising healthy, older subjects from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database. Specifically, possession of a minor allele at rs6850306 was protective against conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center cohort (hazard ratio = 0.593, 95% confidence interval = 0.387-0.907, n = 911, PBonf = 0.032), in keeping with the negative direction of effect reported in the genome-wide association study (betadisease progression score = -0.07 +- 0.01). The implicated locus is linked to genes with known connections to Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology and other neurodegenerative diseases. Using multimodal imaging phenotypes in association studies may assist in unveiling the genetic drivers of the onset and progression of complex diseases.

29860944|t|Proteomics analysis identifies new markers associated with capillary cerebral amyloid angiopathy in Alzheimer's disease.
29860944|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid beta (Abeta) deposits as plaques in the parenchyma and in the walls of cortical and leptomeningeal blood vessels of the brain called cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). It is suggested that CAA type-1, which refers to amyloid deposition in both capillaries and larger vessels, adds to the symptomatic manifestation of AD and correlates with disease severity. Currently, CAA cannot be diagnosed pre-mortem and disease mechanisms involved in CAA are elusive. To obtain insight in the disease mechanism of CAA and to identify marker proteins specifically associated with CAA we performed a laser dissection microscopy assisted mass spectrometry analysis of post-mortem human brain tissue of (I) AD cases with only amyloid deposits in the brain parenchyma and no vascular related amyloid, (II) AD cases with severe CAA type-1 and no or low numbers of parenchymal amyloid deposits and (III) cognitively healthy controls without amyloid deposits. By contrasting the quantitative proteomics data between the three groups, 29 potential CAA-selective proteins were identified. A selection of these proteins was analysed by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry to confirm regulation and to determine protein localization and their relation to brain pathology. In addition, specificity of these markers in relation to other small vessel diseases including prion CAA, CADASIL, CARASAL and hypertension related small vessel disease was assessed using immunohistochemistry.Increased levels of clusterin (CLU), apolipoprotein E (APOE) and serum amyloid P-component (APCS) were observed in AD cases with CAA. In addition, we identified norrin (NDP) and collagen alpha-2(VI) (COL6A2) as highly selective markers that are clearly present in CAA yet virtually absent in relation to parenchymal amyloid plaque pathology. NDP showed the highest specificity to CAA when compared to other small vessel diseases. The specific changes in the proteome of CAA provide new insight in the pathogenesis and yields valuable selective biomarkers for the diagnosis of CAA.

29865063|t|Sex Moderates the Impact of Diagnosis and Amyloid PET Positivity on Hippocampal Subfield Volume.
29865063|a|We examined moderation effects of sex and diagnosis on the effect of positive florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) amyloid-beta (Abeta) scan (A+) on hippocampus subfield volumes in 526 normal control (NC) and early mild cognitive impairment (eMCI) participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI2; ADNI-GO). Regression moderation models showed that women- but not men- with NC designation did not show reduced subiculum volumes despite A+. At the eMCI stage, A+ was detrimental across sexes. Findings were significant while accounting for the effects of age, cognition at screening, education, and APOE4 carrier status. These findings suggest that women with A+ have early neural resistance to Alzheimer's disease-related amyloid burden.

29865064|t|Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase Deficiency Deregulates Regional Brain Amyloid-beta Protein Precursor Expression and Phosphorylation Levels.
29865064|a|Deregulation of the amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) plays a critical role in the neurodegenerative cascade of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Significantly, common functional polymorphisms in the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene are a risk factor for the development of late-onset AD. Reduced MTHFR activity is associated with alterations in folate and homocysteine metabolism. Here, we first show that in young MTHFR knockout mice, mild and severe MTHFR deficiency markedly increase cortical and hippocampal AbetaPP phosphorylation at the regulatory Thr668 site. However, the hippocampus is especially vulnerable to the effects of aging and mild MTHFR deficiency. Notably, the effects of severe MTHFR deficiency in young mice are recapitulated by prolonged dietary folate deficiency in old mice, which leads to regional brain accumulation of cystathionine due to impaired methylation of homocysteine. The incremental AbetaPP phosphorylation at Thr668 mediated by severe genetic-or diet-induced impairment of the folate cycle correlates with enhanced accumulation of demethylated protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and activation of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta). Lastly, we show that severe disturbances in folate metabolism can also affect AbetaPP expression levels in a brain region specific manner. Together our findings identify a novel link between genetic MTHFR deficiency, activation of GSK-3beta, demethylation of PP2A, and enhanced phosphorylation of AbetaPP at Thr668, which is known to critically influence neuronal AbetaPP function and pathological amyloidogenic processing. Deregulation of AbetaPP provides a novel mechanism by which common human MTHFR polymorphisms may interact with dietary folate deficiency to alter neuronal homeostasis and increase the risk for sporadic AD.

29865069|t|Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping of Amyloid-beta Aggregates in Alzheimer's Disease with 7T MR.
29865069|a|BACKGROUND: PET imaging is an established technique to detect cerebral amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques in vivo. Some preclinical and postmortem data report an accumulation of redox-active iron near Abeta plaques. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) at high-field MRI enables iron deposits to be depicted with high spatial resolution. OBJECTIVE: Aim of this study was to examine whether iron and Abeta plaque accumulation is related and thus, whether 7T MRI might be an additive diagnostic tool to Abeta PET imaging. METHODS: Postmortem human Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy control (HC) frontal gray matter (GM) was imaged with 7T MRI which resulted in T1 maps and QSM. Abeta plaque load was determined by histopathology. In vivo, 10 Abeta PET-positive AD patients (74.1+-6.0a) and 10 Abeta PET-negative HCs (67.1+-4.4a) underwent 7T MR examination and QSM maps were analyzed. Severity of cognitive deficits was determined by MMSE. RESULTS: Postmortem, the susceptibility of Abeta plaque-containing GM were higher than those of Abeta plaque-free GM (0.011+-0.002 versus - 0.008+-0.003 ppm, p < 0.001). In vivo, only the bilateral globus pallidus showed significantly higher susceptibility in AD patients compared to HCs (right: 0.277+-0.018 versus - 0.009+-0.009 ppm; left: 0.293+-0.014 versus - 0.007+-0.012 ppm, p < 0.0001). The pallidal QSM values were negatively correlated with those of the MMSE (r = - 0.69, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The postmortem study revealed significant susceptibility differences between the Abeta plaque-containing and Abeta plaque-free GM, whereas in vivo only the QSM values of the globus pallidus differed significantly between AD and HC group. The pallidal QSM values correlated with the severity of cognitive deficits. These findings encourage efforts to optimize the 7T-QSM methodology.

29865080|t|Neuroprotective Effects of Ginsenoside Rf on Amyloid-beta-Induced Neurotoxicity in vitro and in vivo.
29865080|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the deposition of amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta). Abeta accumulation leads to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, inflammation, axonal injury, synapse loss, and neuronal apoptosis. Thus, reducing Abeta levels should exert a neuroprotective effect against AD. Ginsenoside Rf, an extract from Panax notoginseng, has potent anti-fatigue, anti-nociception, anti-oxidation, and anti-inflammation properties. However, it is unclear whether ginsenoside Rf is effective in the treatment of AD. Here, we reported that ginsenoside Rf could significantly attenuate Abeta-induced apoptosis in N2A cells, as reflected by a dramatic increase in mitochondrial membrane potential and decrease in Ca2 + concentration, reactive oxygen species, and active caspase-3 expression. Meanwhile, ginsenoside Rf could alleviate the Abeta-induced inflammation reaction, such as the decrease of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and active caspase-1 expression and the increase of interleukin-13. Furthermore, we also found that Rf is able to accelerate Abeta clearance and subsequently reduces Abeta level in N2A cells stably transfected with human Swedish mutant APP695 (N2A-APP). More importantly, daily Rf treatment (20 mg/kg, i.p.) throughout the experiment dramatically improved spatial learning and memory in Abeta42-induced mouse model of AD. Taken together, these results indicate that ginsenoside Rf may decrease Abeta-induced neurotoxicity and memory decline via anti-inflammatory response during AD development, suggesting that Rf may be a potential therapeutic agent for treating AD.

29865187|t|Butterbur Leaves Attenuate Memory Impairment and Neuronal Cell Damage in Amyloid Beta-Induced Alzheimer's Disease Models.
29865187|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, and is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) as a pathological hallmark. Abeta plays a central role in neuronal degeneration and synaptic dysfunction through the generation of excessive oxidative stress. In the present study, we explored whether leaves of Petasites japonicus (Siebold & Zucc.) Maxim. (PL), called butterbur and traditionally used in folk medicine, show neuroprotective action against Abeta25-35 plaque neurotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. We found that PL protected Abeta25-35 plaque-induced neuronal cell death and intracellular reactive oxygen species generation in HT22 cells by elevating expression levels of phosphorylated cyclic AMP response element-binding protein, heme oxygenase-1, and NAD(P)H quinine dehydrogenase 1. These neuroprotective effects of PL were also observed in Abeta25-35 plaque-injected AD mouse models. Moreover, administration of PL diminished Abeta25-35 plaque-induced synaptic dysfunction and memory impairment in mice. These findings lead us to suggest that PL can protect neurons against Abeta25-35 plaque-induced neurotoxicity and thus may be a potential candidate to regulate the progression of AD.

29869390|t|Dihydromyricetin inhibits microglial activation and neuroinflammation by suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome activation in APP/PS1 transgenic mice.
29869390|a|BACKGROUND: Activated microglia-mediated inflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition, chronic activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes triggered by amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) in microglia contributes to persistent neuroinflammation. Here, the primary goal was to assess whether Dihydromyricetin (DHM), a plant flavonoid compound, is effective therapies for AD; it is crucial to know whether DHM will affect microglial activation and neuroinflammation in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. METHODS: After DHM was intraperitoneally injected in APP/PS1 double-transgenic mice, we assessed the effect of DHM on microglial activation, the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome components, and the production of inflammatory cytokine IL-1beta by immunofluorescence and Western blot. To determine whether DHM play roles in the Abeta production and deposition, amyloid beta protein precursor (APP) and beta-site APP cleaving enzyme1 (BACE1), as well as neprilysin (NEP), were detected by Western blot. Finally, behavior was tested by Morris Water Maze to illustrate whether DHM treatment has a significantly positive effect on ameliorating the memory and cognition deficits in AD. RESULTS: Dihydromyricetin treatment significantly ameliorated memory and cognition deficits and decreased the number of activated microglia in the hippocampus and cortex of APP/PS1 mice. In addition, APP/PS1 mice show reduced activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes and reduced expression of NLRP3 inflammasome components. Furthermore, DHM could promote clearance of Abeta, a trigger for NLRP3 inflammasome activation, by increasing levels of NEP and shift microglial conversion to the M2-specific agrinase-1-positive cell phenotype, which enhances microglial clearance of Abeta and its aggregates but not production of Abeta. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our findings suggest that DHM prevents progression of AD-like pathology through inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome-based microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and may be a promising therapeutic drug for treating AD.

29872774|t|Hetero-assembly of a dual beta-amyloid variant peptide system.
29872774|a|Self-assembly of amyloid polypeptides (1) imparts biological effects depending on the size in over 20 amyloid diseases and (2) produces useful yet relatively untapped biomaterials. Unfortunately, our understanding of amyloid polypeptides, as related to biomedical implications and biomaterial applications, is limited by their self-assembling nature. In this study, we report the creation of a dual peptide system, where a pair of beta-amyloid (Abeta) variants are not self-assembled but hetero-assembled in the presence of their assembly partners. We provide evidence that the resulting hetero-assemblies share molecular, structural and morphological similarities with typical amyloid self-assemblies formed by a single polypeptide (e.g., Abeta). We anticipate that our dual peptide system may readily be adapted for precise control of amyloid assembly, for the study of size-dependent neurotoxicity and precise fabrication of amyloid biomaterials.

29878075|t|Neurodegenerative disease concomitant proteinopathies are prevalent, age-related and APOE4-associated.
29878075|a|Lewy bodies commonly occur in Alzheimer's disease, and Alzheimer's disease pathology is frequent in Lewy body diseases, but the burden of co-pathologies across neurodegenerative diseases is unknown. We assessed the extent of tau, amyloid-beta, alpha-synuclein and TDP-43 proteinopathies in 766 autopsied individuals representing a broad spectrum of clinical neurodegenerative disease. We interrogated pathological Alzheimer's disease (n = 247); other tauopathies (n = 95) including Pick's disease, corticobasal disease and progressive supranuclear palsy; the synucleinopathies (n = 164) including multiple system atrophy and Lewy body disease; the TDP-43 proteinopathies (n = 188) including frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; and a minimal pathology group (n = 72). Each group was divided into subgroups without or with co-pathologies. Age and sex matched logistic regression models compared co-pathology prevalence between groups. Co-pathology prevalence was similar between the minimal pathology group and most neurodegenerative diseases for each proteinopathy: tau was nearly universal (92-100%), amyloid-beta common (20-57%); alpha-synuclein less common (4-16%); and TDP-43 the rarest (0-16%). In several neurodegenerative diseases, co-pathology increased: in Alzheimer's disease, alpha-synuclein (41-55%) and TDP-43 (33-40%) increased; in progressive supranuclear palsy, alpha-synuclein increased (22%); in corticobasal disease, TDP-43 increased (24%); and in neocortical Lewy body disease, amyloid-beta (80%) and TDP-43 (22%) increased. Total co-pathology prevalence varied across groups (27-68%), and was increased in high Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and neocortical Lewy body disease (70-81%). Increased age at death was observed in the minimal pathology group, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple system atrophy cases with co-pathologies. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and neocortical Lewy body disease, co-pathologies associated with APOE e4. Lewy body disease cases with Alzheimer's disease co-pathology had substantially lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores than pure Lewy body disease. Our data imply that increased age and APOE e4 status are risk factors for co-pathologies independent of neurodegenerative disease; that neurodegenerative disease severity influences co-pathology as evidenced by the prevalence of co-pathology in high Alzheimer's disease and neocortical Lewy body disease, but not intermediate Alzheimer's disease or limbic Lewy body disease; and that tau and alpha-synuclein strains may also modify co-pathologies since tauopathies and synucleinopathies had differing co-pathologies and burdens. These findings have implications for clinical trials that focus on monotherapies targeting tau, amyloid-beta, alpha-synuclein and TDP-43.

29879415|t|An impedimetric micro-immunosensing assay to detect Alzheimer's disease biomarker: Abeta40.
29879415|a|A miniaturized biosensing platform, based on monoclonal amyloid-beta antibodies (mAbetaab) that were immobilized on a disc-shaped platinum/iridium (Pt/Ir) microelectrode surface coupled with an impedimetric signal transducer, was developed for the label-free and sensitive detection of amyloid-beta peptide fragment 1-40 (Abeta40); a reliable biomarker for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A Pt/Ir microelectrode was electropolymerized with poly (ortho-phenylenediamine), a conducting free amine-containing aromatic polymer; followed by crosslinking with glutaraldehyde for subsequent coupling of mAbetaab on the microelectrode surface. This modification strategy efficiently improved the impedimetric detection performance of Abeta40 in terms of charge transfer resistance (~400-fold difference) and normalized impedance magnitude percentage change (~40% increase) compared with a passive adsorption-based immobilization method. The sensitivity of the micro-immunosensing assay was found to be 1056 kOmega/(pg/mL)/cm2 and the limit of detection was found to be 4.81 pg/mL with a dynamic range of 1-104 pg/mL (R2 = 0.9932). The overall precision of the assay, as measured by relative standard deviation, ranged from 0.84 to 5.15%, demonstrating its reliability and accuracy; while in respect to assay durability and stability, the immobilized mAbetaab were able to maintain 80% of their binding activity to Abeta40 after incubation for 48 h at ambient temperature (25  C). To validate the practical applicability, the assay was tested using brain tissue lysates prepared from AD-induced rats. Results indicate that the proposed impedimetric micro-immunosensing platform is highly versatile and adaptable for the quantitative detection of other disease-related biomarkers.

29879605|t|Sub-chronic celecoxib prevents soluble beta amyloid-induced depressive-like behaviour in rats.
29879605|a|BACKGROUND: Depression and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are co-morbid conditions. Neuropsychiatric symptoms have been reported as prodromal symptoms of AD-like dementia and soluble forms of beta amyloid peptide (Abeta), the main constituent of insoluble plaques typical of AD brains, have been implicated in such an effect. We have previously shown that intracerebral injection of Abeta can evoke a depressive-like state in rats, accompanied by neurochemical and neuroendocrine alterations reminiscent of depressive symptoms in humans. AD and depression are crucially linked by neuroinflammation and cyclooxygenase II (COX-2) enzyme involvement is an intriguing field of research. Indeed, its pharmacological inhibition has shown both antidepressant and Abeta modulating effects. METHODS: Male rats were exposed to sub-chronic celecoxib (15 mg/kg/day sc for 8 days), a selective COX-2 inhibitor or vehicle (saline), starting from the day before central intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta peptide (5microL of 4 microM solution or vehicle for sham). Animals were tested for depressive-like behaviour by using the forced swimming test paradigm and prefrontal serotonin (5-HT) content and plasma Abeta levels were further evaluated. RESULTS: We found that celecoxib treatment prevented the pro-depressive effects induced by Abeta. Moreover, it also prevented the reduction in 5-HT content in prefrontal cortex of Abeta-treated rats and decreased their plasma Abeta levels. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data indicate that celecoxib could be a suitable pharmaceutical tool for the treatment of depressive state related to increased Abeta levels.

29880901|t|Inflammation, neurodegeneration and protein aggregation in the retina as ocular biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease in the 3xTg-AD mouse model.
29880901|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. In the pathogenesis of AD a pivotal role is played by two neurotoxic proteins that aggregate and accumulate in the central nervous system: amyloid beta and hyper-phosphorylated tau. Accumulation of extracellular amyloid beta plaques and intracellular hyper-phosphorylated tau tangles, and consequent neuronal loss begins 10-15 years before any cognitive impairment. In addition to cognitive and behavioral deficits, sensorial abnormalities have been described in AD patients and in some AD transgenic mouse models. Retina can be considered a simple model of the brain, as some pathological changes and therapeutic strategies from the brain may be observed or applicable to the retina. Here we propose new retinal biomarkers that could anticipate the AD diagnosis and help the beginning and the follow-up of possible future treatments. We analyzed retinal tissue of triple-transgenic AD mouse model (3xTg-AD) for the presence of pathological hallmarks during disease progression. We found the presence of amyloid beta plaques, tau tangles, neurodegeneration, and astrogliosis in the retinal ganglion cell layer of 3xTg-AD mice, already at pre-symptomatic stage. Moreover, retinal microglia in pre-symptomatic mice showed a ramified, anti-inflammatory phenotype which, during disease progression, switches to a pro-inflammatory, less ramified one, becoming neurotoxic. We hypothesize retina as a window through which monitor AD-related neurodegeneration process.

29882247|t|Dual-Modal NIR-Fluorophore Conjugated Magnetic Nanoparticle for Imaging Amyloid-beta Species In Vivo.
29882247|a|Senile plaques, the extracellular deposit of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides, are one of the neuropathological hallmarks found in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. The current method of brain imaging of amyloid plaques based on positron emission tomography (PET) is expensive and invasive with low spatial resolution. Thus, the development of sensitive and nonradiative amyloid-beta (Abeta)-specific contrast agents is highly important and beneficial to achieve early AD detection, monitor the disease progression, and evaluate the effectiveness of potential AD drugs. Here a neuroprotective dual-modal nanoprobe developed by integrating highly Abeta-specific and turn-on fluorescence cyanine sensors with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles as an effective near-infrared imaging (NIRI)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent for imaging of Abeta species in vivo is reported. This Abeta-specific probe is found not only nontoxic and noninvasive, but also highly blood brain barrier permeable. It also shows a potent neuroprotective effect against Abeta-induced toxicities. This nanoprobe is successfully applied for in vivo fluorescence imaging with high sensitivity and selectivity to Abeta species, and MRI with high spatial resolution in an APP/PS1 transgenic mice model. Its potential as a powerful in vivo dual-modal imaging tool for early detection and diagnosis of AD in humans is affirmed.

29883933|t|Discovery of dihydrobenzofuran neolignans from Rubus ideaus L. with enantioselective anti-Abeta1-42 aggregation activity.
29883933|a|Four new dihydrobenzofuran neolignans 1a/1b and 2a/2b were isolated from the fruit of Rubus ideaus. 1a/1b and 2a/2b as two pairs of enantiomers were separated on a chiral chromatographic column. Their structures were determined using a suite of techniques including 1D and 2D NMR, HRESIMS, together with theoretical electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculation. All compounds were evaluated for their inhibition of self-induced Abeta1-42 aggregation. Compounds 1b and 2a exhibited optimal Abeta1-42 aggregation inhibition capability, with an inhibition potency of 81.6% and 83.4% at 20 muM, respectively. Additionally, molecular docking was performed to identify the possible factor responsible for the enantioselectivity in the anti-Abeta1-42 aggregation activity.

29889070|t|Herpes Viruses and Senile Dementia: First Population Evidence for a Causal Link.
29889070|a|Three articles have very recently appeared that are of especial relevance to the causes of dementia and its potential treatment. The first two (Tsai et al., published in PLoS One in November 2017; Chen et al., published in the January/February 2018 issue of Journal of Clinical Psychiatry) demonstrate an increased risk of subsequent senile dementia (SD) development in patients with acute varicella zoster (herpes zoster) infection. These articles present data highly relevant to the third, and most important, paper-by Tzeng et al., published online in the journal Neurotherapeutics at the end of February 2018. These authors report that infection with a different herpes virus, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1), leads to a similarly increased risk of later developing SD. Further, when the authors looked at patients treated aggressively with antiherpetic medications at the time, the relative risk of SD was reduced by a factor of 10. It should be stressed that no investigations were made on subjects already suffering from SD, and that those treated were the few rare cases severely affected by HSV. Nonetheless, antiherpetic medication prevented later SD development in 90% of their study group. These articles provide the first population evidence for a causal link between herpes virus infection and senile dementia.

29889075|t|Impact of Amyloid PET Imaging in the Memory Clinic: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
29889075|a|BACKGROUND: Patients with cognitive impairment or dementias of uncertain etiology are frequently referred to a memory disorders specialty clinic. The impact of and role for amyloid PET imaging (Abeta-PET) may be most appropriate in this clinical setting. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the impact of Abeta-PET on etiological diagnosis and clinical management in the memory clinic setting. METHODS: A search of the literature on the impact of Abeta-PET in the memory clinic setting between 1 January 2004 and 12 February 2018 was conducted. Meta-analysis using a random effects model was performed to determine the pooled estimate of the impact of Abeta-PET in the changes of diagnoses and changes in management plan. RESULTS: After rigorous review, results from 13 studies were extracted, involving 1,489 patients. Meta-analysis revealed a pooled effect of change in diagnoses of 35.2% (95% CI 24.6-47.5). Sub-analyses showed that the pooled effect in change in diagnoses if Abeta-PET was used under the appropriate use criteria (AUC) or non-AUC criteria were 47.8% (95% CI 25.9-70.5) and 29.6% (95% CI: 21.5-39.3), respectively. The pooled effect of a change of diagnosis from Alzheimer's disease (AD) to non-AD and from non-AD to AD were 22.7% (95% CI: 17.1-29.5) and 25.6% (95% CI: 17.6-35.8), respectively. The pooled effect leading to a change of management was 59.6% (95% CI 39.4-77.0). CONCLUSIONS: Abeta-PET has a highly significant impact on both changes in diagnosis and management among patients being seen at a specialty memory clinic.

29890120|t|Transthyretin Interferes with Abeta Amyloid Formation by Redirecting Oligomeric Nuclei into Non-Amyloid Aggregates.
29890120|a|The pathological Abeta aggregates associated with Alzheimer's disease follow a nucleation-dependent path of formation. A nucleus represents an oligomeric assembly of Abeta peptides that acts as a template for subsequent incorporation of monomers to form a fibrillar structure. Nuclei can form de novo or via surface-catalyzed secondary nucleation, and the combined rates of elongation and nucleation control the overall rate of fibril formation. Transthyretin (TTR) obstructs Abeta fibril formation in favor of alternative non-fibrillar assemblies, but the mechanism behind this activity is not fully understood. This study shows that TTR does not significantly disturb fibril elongation; rather, it effectively interferes with the formation of oligomeric nuclei. We demonstrate that this interference can be modulated by altering the relative contribution of elongation and nucleation, and we show how TTR's effects can range from being essentially ineffective to almost complete inhibition of fibril formation without changing the concentration of TTR or monomeric Abeta.

29890636|t|Amyloid Beta Peptide Is Released during Thrombosis in the Skin.
29890636|a|While it is known that amyloid beta (Abeta) deposits are found in different tissues of both Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and healthy individuals, there remain questions about the physiological role of these deposits, the origin of the Abeta peptide, and the mechanisms of its localization to the tissues. Using immunostaining with specific antibodies, as well as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, this study demonstrated Abeta40 peptide accumulation in the skin during local experimental photothrombosis in mice. Specifically, Abeta peptide accumulation was concentrated near the dermal blood vessels in thrombotic skin. It was also studied whether the released peptide affects microorganisms. Application of Abeta40 (4 microM) to the external membrane of yeast cells significantly increased membrane conductance with no visible effect on mouse host cells. The results suggest that Abeta release in the skin is related to skin injury and thrombosis, and occurs along with clotting whenever skin is damaged. These results support the proposition that Abeta release during thrombosis serves as part of a natural defense against infection.

29894164|t|The Human Amyloid Precursor Protein Binds Copper Ions Dominated by a Picomolar-Affinity Site in the Helix-Rich E2 Domain.
29894164|a|A manifestation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the aggregation in the brain of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP has been linked to modulation of normal copper homeostasis, while dysregulation of Abeta production and clearance has been associated with disruption of copper balance. However, quantitative copper chemistry on APP is lacking, in contrast to the plethora of copper chemistry available for Abeta peptides. The soluble extracellular protein domain sAPPalpha (molar mass including post-translational modifications of ~100 kDa) has now been isolated in good yield and high quality. It is known to feature several copper binding sites with different affinities. However, under Cu-limiting conditions, it binds either Cu(I) or Cu(II) with picomolar affinity at a single site (labeled M1) that is located within the APP E2 subdomain. M1 in E2 was identified previously by X-ray crystallography as a Cu(II) site that features four histidine side chains (H313, H386, H432, and H436) as ligands. The presence of CuII(His)4 is confirmed in solution at pH <=7.4, while Cu(I) binding involves either the same ligands or a subset. The binding affinities are pH-dependent, and the picomolar affinities for both Cu(I) and Cu(II) at pH 7.4 indicate that either oxidation state may be accessible under physiological conditions. Redox activity was observed in the presence of an electron donor (ascorbate) and acceptor (dioxygen). A critical analysis of the potential biological implications of these findings is presented.

29895690|a|The aggregation of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide is linked to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In particular, some point mutations within Abeta are associated with early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease. Here we set out to explore how the physical properties of the altered side chains, including their sizes and charges, affect the molecular mechanisms of aggregation. We focus on Abeta42 with familial mutations-A21G (Flemish), E22K (Italian), E22G (Arctic), E22Q (Dutch), and D23N (Iowa)-which lead to similar or identical pathology with sporadic AD or severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Through global kinetic analysis, we find that for the E22K, E22G, E22Q, and D23N mutations, the acceleration of the overall aggregation originates primarily from the modulation of the nucleation processes, in particular secondary nucleation on the surface of existing fibrils, whereas the elongation process is not significantly affected. Remarkably, the D23 position appears to be responsible for most of the charge effects during nucleation, while the size of the side chain at the E22 position plays a more significant role than its charge. Thus, we have developed a kinetic approach to determine the nature and the magnitude of the contribution of specific residues to the rate of individual steps of the aggregation reaction, through targeted mutations and variations in ionic strength. This strategy can help rationalize the effect of some disease-related mutations as well as yield insights into the mechanism of aggregation and the transition states of the wild-type protein.

29897618|t|Effect of ferric citrate on amyloid-beta peptides behavior.
29897618|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) aggregation and oxidative stress are two of the central events in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Both these phenomena can be caused by the interaction of Abeta with metal ions. In the last years the interaction between ZnII , CuII , and Abeta was much studied, but between iron and Abeta it is still little known. In this work we determine how three Abeta peptides, present in AD, interact with FeIII -citrate. The three Abeta peptides are: full length Abeta1-42, an isoform truncated at Glutamic acid in position three, Abeta3-42, and its pyroglutamated form AbetapE3-42. Conformation and morphology of the three peptides, aggregated with and without FeIII -citrate were studied. Besides, we have determined the strength of the interactions Abeta/FeIII -citrate studying the effect of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid as chelator. Results reported here demonstrate that FeIII -citrate promotes the aggregation in all the three peptides. Moreover, Aspartic acid 1, Glutamic acid 3, and Tyrosine 10 have an important role in the coordination with iron, generating a more stable complex for Abeta1-42 compared to that for the truncated peptides.

29901238|t|Differential Modulation of the Aggregation of N-Terminal Truncated Abeta using Cucurbiturils.
29901238|a|Modulating the aggregation of Abeta has long been considered to be one of the potential methods to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has been found that different Abeta species, including N-terminal truncated or/and modified Abeta, co-exist in the brain of AD patients. Yet, there is currently little detailed work about the specific modulation of these Abeta species which hinders us to understand their roles in patients' brain. Using thioflavin T (ThT) kinetics and transmission electron microscope, here we showed that cucurbit[7]uril and cucurbit[8]uril could inhibit the aggregation of both Abeta4-40 and Abeta1-40 through host-guest interactions. Chemical kinetics analysis suggested that this happened through inhibiting the elongation process by binding with fibril ends. In addition, cucurbiturils showed greater capability on the inhibition of Abeta4-40 than Abeta1-40 , which was possibly due to the N-terminal phenylalanine residue of Abeta4-40 . Our work provided new insights for the development of host-guest chemistry based inhibitors for the aggregation of different Abeta species.

29901458|t|Dating of Traumatic Brain Injury in Forensic Cases Using Immunohistochemical Markers (I): Neurofilaments and beta-Amyloid Precursor Protein.
29901458|a|Studies about head trauma are experimental or have a clinical or prognosis purpose. In this study, we used samples from human autopsies to answer common medical-legal questions.We studied 21 problem cases and 4 controls. Samples were obtained directly from the injured area, fixed in 10% formalin during 24 hours and then preserved in 70% ethanol. This procedure optimizes the immunohistochemical technique.The neurofilament antibody shows beaded axons since the first moment; over time, they increase their density and diameter as survival time also increases. These changes begin in the gray matter, 2 hours after trauma can be seen around vessels and in hemorrhagic areas. At 24 hours, beaded axons appear in the white mater, which finally loses its structure and cellular density.On the other hand, the beta-amyloid precursor protein marker begins to be weakly seen 2 hours after injury. At 24 hours, a diffuse pattern can appear, suggesting primary traumatic injury. The marker reading keeps increasing until day 26, when a "Z" pattern appears in the white matter, suggesting secondary hypoxic injury.All these chronologic changes could be useful to approach the date of trauma. They let us to distinguish between long surviving cases from those whose death was immediate (within the first 30 minutes).

29902125|t|Silencing of LncRNA BDNF-AS attenuates Abeta25-35-induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells by suppressing cell apoptosis and oxidative stress.
29902125|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) brain-derived neurotrophic factor anti-sense (BDNF-AS) on the Abeta25-35-induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells. METHODS: PC12 cells were induced by Abeta25-35 to construct cell injury models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and then transfected with siRNA-BDNF-AS. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was employed to detect the expressions of BDNF-AS and BDNF. Besides, 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and Hoechst33342 staining were utilized to analyze the cell viability and apoptosis, respectively, Western blotting to evaluate the protein expressions, immunofluorescence to assess the Cytochrome C (Cyt C) release, and Rhodamine 123 (Rh123) to measure the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP).The evaluation of oxidative stress was conducted via the determination of the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT). RESULTS: Abeta25-35 apparently increased BDNF-AS but decreased BDNF in PC12 cells, which also reduced viability and induced apoptosis of PC12 cells. Silencing of BDNF-AS could significantly up-regulate BDNF in Abeta25-35-induced PC12 cells, with the elevated cell viability. Moreover, silencing BDNF-AS inhibited the apoptosis of Abeta25-35-induced PC12 cells, suppressed the release of Cyt C, reduced the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax, and lowered the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of Rh123, but it elevated the expression of Bcl-2. Besides, silencing BDNF-AS also reduced ROS intensity and MDA content, but enhanced the activities of SOD and CAT. CONCLUSION: Silencing BDNF-AS exerts protective functions to increase the viability, inhibit the apoptosis and oxidative stress of Abeta25-35-induced PC12 cells by negative regulation of BDNF.

29902376|t|Structure-Property Relationships of Polyethylene Glycol Modified Fluorophore as Near-Infrared Abeta Imaging Probes.
29902376|a|To optimize the lipophilicity and improve in vivo pharmacokinetics of near-infrared probes targeted Abeta plaques, we designed, synthesized, and evaluated a series of polyethylene glycol modified probes with hydroxyl and methoxyl terminals. The relationships between chemical structure and optical, biological properties were systemically elucidated. The results indicated that a desired Abeta probe should keep a balance among molecular rigidity, size, and lipophilicity. Probe 12d displayed improved properties including intense and selective response to Abeta1-42 aggregates ( Kd = 7.3 nM, 22-fold fluorescence enhancement and emission maxima at 715 nm upon interaction with Abeta1-42 aggregates), sufficient blood-brain barrier penetration (3.04% ID/g), and fast wash out from the brain (brain2 min/brain60 min = 10.1). Clear fluorescence signals retention in transgenic mice than control mice in in vivo near-infrared imaging. Hence, polyethylene glycol modified probes retained favorable optical properties but displayed great improvement of biological properties for Abeta detection.

29905953|t|Mass spectrometry is a multifaceted weapon to be used in the battle against Alzheimer's disease: Amyloid beta peptides and beyond.
29905953|a|Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) accumulation and aggregation have been considered for many years the main cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and therefore have been the principal target of investigation as well as of the proposed therapeutic approaches (Grasso [2011] Mass Spectrom Rev. 30: 347-365). However, the amyloid cascade hypothesis, which considers Abeta accumulation the only causative agent of the disease, has proven to be incomplete if not wrong. In recent years, actors such as metal ions, oxidative stress, and other cofactors have been proposed as possible co-agents or, in some cases, main causative factors of AD. In this scenario, MS investigation has proven to be fundamental to design possible diagnostic strategies of this elusive disease, as well as to understand the biomolecular mechanisms involved, in the attempt to find a possible therapeutic solution. We review the current applications of MS in the search for possible Abeta biomarkers of AD to help the diagnosis of the disease. Recent examples of the important contributions that MS has given to prove or build theories on the molecular pathways involved with such terrible disease are also reviewed.

29908079|t|Targeted brain proteomics uncover multiple pathways to Alzheimer's dementia.
29908079|a|OBJECTIVE: Previous gene expression analysis identified a network of coexpressed genes that is associated with beta-amyloid neuropathology and cognitive decline in older adults. The current work targeted influential genes in this network with quantitative proteomics to identify potential novel therapeutic targets. METHODS: Data came from 834 community-based older persons who were followed annually, died, and underwent brain autopsy. Uniform structured postmortem evaluations assessed the burden of beta-amyloid and other common age-related neuropathologies. Selected reaction monitoring quantified cortical protein abundance of 12 genes prioritized from a molecular network of aging human brain that is implicated in Alzheimer's dementia. Regression and linear mixed models examined the protein associations with beta-amyloid load and other neuropathological indices as well as cognitive decline over multiple years preceding death. RESULTS: Average age at death was 88.6 years. Overall, 349 participants (41.9%) had Alzheimer's dementia at death. A higher level of PLXNB1 abundance was associated with more beta-amyloid load (p = 1.0 x 10-7 ) and higher PHFtau tangle density (p = 2.3 x 10-7 ), and the association of PLXNB1 with cognitive decline is mediated by these known Alzheimer's disease pathologies. On the other hand, higher IGFBP5, HSPB2, and AK4 and lower ITPK1 levels were associated with faster cognitive decline, and, unlike PLXNB1, these associations were not fully explained by common neuropathological indices, suggesting novel mechanisms leading to cognitive decline. INTERPRETATION: Using targeted proteomics, this work identified cortical proteins involved in Alzheimer's dementia and begins to dissect two different molecular pathways: one affecting beta-amyloid deposition and another affecting resilience without a known pathological footprint.

29912176|t|MK-0677, a Ghrelin Agonist, Alleviates Amyloid Beta-Related Pathology in 5XFAD Mice, an Animal Model of Alzheimer's Disease.
29912176|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive deficits, neuroinflammation, and neuronal death. The primary pathogenic cause is believed to be the accumulation of pathogenic amyloid beta (Abeta) assemblies in the brain. Ghrelin, which is a peptide hormone predominantly secreted from the stomach, is an endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue-receptor type 1a (GHS-R1a). MK-0677 is a ghrelin agonist that potently stimulates the GHS-R1a ghrelin receptor. Interestingly, previous studies have shown that ghrelin improves cognitive impairments and attenuates neuronal death and neuroinflammation in several neurological disorders. However, it is unknown whether MK-0677 can affect Abeta accumulation or Abeta-mediated pathology in the brains of patients with AD. Therefore, we examined the effects of MK-0677 administration on AD-related pathology in 5XFAD mice, an Abeta-overexpressing transgenic mouse model of AD. MK-0677 was intraperitoneally administered to three-month-old 5XFAD mice. To visualize Abeta accumulation, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration, thioflavin-S staining and immunostaining with antibodies against Abeta (4G8), ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN), and synaptophysin were conducted in the neocortex of 5XFAD and wild-type mice, and to evaluate changes of phosphorylated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein (pCREB) levels, immunostaining with antibody against pCREB was performed in dentate gyrus of the hippocampus of 5XFAD and wild-type mice. The histological analyses indicated that MK-0677-treated 5XFAD mice showed reduced Abeta deposition, gliosis, and neuronal and synaptic loss in the deep cortical layers, and inhibited the decrement of pCREB levels in dentate gyrus of the hippocampus compared to vehicle-treated 5XFAD mice. Our results showed that activation of the ghrelin receptor with MK-0677 inhibited the Abeta burden, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration, which suggested that MK-0677 might have potential as a treatment of the early phase of AD.

29913077|t|Higher exosomal tau, amyloid-beta 42 and IL-10 are associated with mild TBIs and chronic symptoms in military personnel.
29913077|a|OBJECTIVE: Identify biomarkers in peripheral blood that relate to chronic post-concussive and behavioural symptoms following traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) to ultimately improve clinical management. RESEARCH DESIGN: We compared military personnel with mild TBIs (mTBIs) (n = 42) to those without TBIs (n = 22) in concentrations of tau, amyloid-beta (Abeta42) and cytokines (tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha, interleukin (IL)-6 and -10) in neuronal-derived exosomes from the peripheral blood. We utilized nanosight technology coupled with ultra-sensitivity immunoassay methods. We also examined the impact of post-concussive and behavioural symptoms including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on these neuronal-derived markers. RESULTS: We report that concentrations of exosomal tau (F1, 62 = 10.50), Abeta42 (F1, 61 = 5.32) and IL-10 (F1, 59 = 4.32) were elevated in the mTBI group compared to the controls. Within the mTBI group, regression models show that post-concussive symptoms were most related to exosomal tau elevations, whereas exosomal IL-10 levels were related to PTSD symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that chronic post-concussive symptoms following an mTBI relate to altered exosomal activity, and that greater tau pathology may underlie chronic post-concussive symptoms that develop following mTBIs. It also suggests that central inflammatory activity contributes to PTSD symptoms following an mTBI, providing necessary insights into the role of inflammation in chronic PTSD symptoms.

29913410|t|Incensole acetate prevents beta-amyloid-induced neurotoxicity in human olfactory bulb neural stem cells.
29913410|a|beta-Amyloid peptide (Abeta) is a potent neurotoxic protein associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) which causes oxidative damage to neurons. Incensole acetate (IA) is a major constituent of Boswellia carterii resin, which has anti-inflammatory and protective properties against damage of a large verity of neural subtypes. However, this neuroprotective effect was not studied on human olfactory bulb neural stem cells (hOBNSCs). Herein, we evaluated this effect and studied the underlying mechanisms. Exposure to Abeta25-35 (5 and 10 muM for 24 h) inhibited proliferation (revealed by downregulation of Nestin and Sox2 gene expression), and induced differentiation (marked by increased expression of the immature neuronal marker Map2 and the astrocyte marker Gfap) of hOBNSCs. However, pre-treatment with IA (100 muM for 4 h) stimulated proliferation and differentiation of neuronal, rather than astrocyte, markers. Moreover, IA pretreatment significantly decreased the Abeta25-35-induced viability loss, apoptotic rate (revealed by decreased caspase 3 activity and protein expression, downregulated expression of Bax, caspase 8, cyto c, caspase3, and upregulated expression of Bcl2 mRNAs and proteins, in addition to elevated mitochondrial membrane potential and lowered intracellular Ca+2). IA reduced Abeta-mediated ROS production (revealed by decreased intracellular ROS and MDA level, and increased SOD, CAT, and GPX contents), and inhibited Abeta-induced inflammation (marked by down-regulated expression of IL1b, TNFa, NfKb, and Cox2 genes). IA also significantly upregulated mRNA and protein expression of Erk1/2 and Nrf2. Notably, IA increased the antioxidant enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and this effect was reversed by HO-1 inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP) leading to reduction of the neuroprotective effect of IA against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. These findings clearly show the ability of IA to initiate proliferation and differentiation of neuronal progenitors in hOBNSCs and induce HO-1 expression, thereby protecting the hOBNSCs cells from Abeta25-35-induced oxidative cell death. Thus, IA may be applicable as a potential preventive agent for AD by its effect on hOBNSCs and could also be used as an adjuvant to hOBNSCs in cellular therapy of neurodegenerative diseases.

29916037|t|Non-Alzheimer's contributions to dementia and cognitive resilience in The 90+ Study.
29916037|a|The diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the oldest-old is complicated by the increasing prevalence of age-related neurofibrillary tangles, plaques and non-AD pathologies such as cerebrovascular disease (CVD), hippocampal sclerosis (HS), aging-related tau astrogliopathy (ARTAG), as well as TDP-43 and Lewy pathology. The contribution of these non-AD pathologies to dementia and cognitive resilience is unclear. We assessed the level of AD neuropathologic change (ADNPC) and non-AD pathology in 185 participants enrolled in The 90+ Study with available cognitive assessments and brain tissue. Logistic regression models-adjusting for age, sex and education-determined the association between each pathology and dementia or between subgroups. 53% had dementia, primarily AD or mixed AD; 23% had cognitive impairment without dementia (CIND); 23% were not impaired. Both AD and non-AD pathology was prevalent. 100% had tangles, 81% had plaques, and both tangles and plaques associated with dementia. ARTAG distributed across limbic (70%), brainstem (39%) and cortical regions (24%). 49% had possible CVD and 26% had definite CVD, while HS was noted in 15%. Cortical ARTAG, CVD and HS were each associated with dementia, but limbic and brainstem ARTAGs were not. TDP-43 and Lewy pathologies were found in 36 and 17% and both associated with dementia. No pathology distinguished CIND and the not impaired. By NIA-AA criteria and dementia status, the cohort was subdivided into four groups: those with minimal ADNPC included the not dementia (ND) and Not AD dementia groups; and those with significant ADNPC included the Resilient without dementia and AD dementia groups. Compared to the ND group, the Not AD dementia group had more HS, cortical ARTAG, TDP-43, and Lewy pathology. Compared to the AD dementia group, the Resilient group had less CVD, no HS and less cortical ARTAG, TDP-43 and Lewy pathology. Our findings imply that reductions in non-AD pathologies including CVD contribute to cognitive resilience in the oldest-old.

29924994|t|Sex-Specific Features of Microglia from Adult Mice.
29924994|a|Sex has a role in the incidence and outcome of neurological illnesses, also influencing the response to treatments. Neuroinflammation is involved in the onset and progression of several neurological diseases, and the fact that estrogens have anti-inflammatory activity suggests that these hormones may be a determinant in the sex-dependent manifestation of brain pathologies. We describe significant differences in the transcriptome of adult male and female microglia, possibly originating from perinatal exposure to sex steroids. Microglia isolated from adult brains maintain the sex-specific features when put in culture or transplanted in the brain of the opposite sex. Female microglia are neuroprotective because they restrict the damage caused by acute focal cerebral ischemia. This study therefore provides insight into a distinct perspective on the mechanisms underscoring a sexual bias in the susceptibility to brain diseases.

29925037|t|TSPO ligand PK11195 improves Alzheimer-related outcomes in aged female 3xTg-AD mice.
29925037|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis is a multifactorial process that involves numerous pathways within the central nervous system. Thus, interventions that interact with several disease-related pathways may offer an increased opportunity for successful prevention and treatment of AD. Translocator protein 18 kD (TSPO) is a mitochondrial protein that is associated with regulation of many cellular processes including inflammation, steroid synthesis, apoptosis, and mitochondrial respiration. Although TSPO ligands have been shown to be protective in several neurodegenerative paradigms, little work has been done to assess their potential as treatments for AD. Female 3xTg-AD mice were administered the TSPO ligand PK11195 once weekly for 5 weeks beginning at 16 months, an age characterized by extensive beta-amyloid pathology and behavioral impairments. Animals treated with PK11195 showed improvements in behavior and modest reductions of in both soluble and deposited beta-amyloid. The finding that short-term PK11195 treatment was effective in improving both behavioral and pathological outcomes in a model of late-stage AD supports further investigation of TSPO ligands as potential therapeutics for the treatment of AD.

29925241|t|Gel Phase Membrane Retards Amyloid beta-Peptide (1-42) Fibrillation by Restricting Slaved Diffusion of Peptides on Lipid Bilayers.
29925241|a|Plasma membranes in the human brain can interact with amyloid beta-peptide (1-42; Abeta42) and induce Abeta42 fibrillation, which is considered to be a crucial process underlying the neurotoxicity of Abeta42 and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanism of membrane-mediated Abeta42 fibrillation at the molecular level remains elusive. Here we study the role of adsorbed Abeta42 peptides on membrane-mediated fibrillation using supported lipid bilayers of varying phase structures (gel and fluid). Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and interfacial specific second-order nonlinear optical spectroscopy, we show that the dynamics of 2D-mobile Abeta42 molecules, facilitated by the highly mobile lipids underneath the peptides, are critical to Abeta42 fibrillation on liquid phase membranes. This growth mechanism is retarded on gel phase membranes where the dynamics of 2D-mobile peptides are restricted by the "frozen" lipids with less mobility.

29925792|t|Exploring the Mechanism of Inhibition of Au Nanoparticles on the Aggregation of Amyloid-beta(16-22) Peptides at the Atom Level by All-Atom Molecular Dynamics.
29925792|a|The abnormal self-assembly of the amyloid-beta peptide into toxic beta-rich aggregates can cause Alzheimer's disease. Recently, it has been shown that small gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) inhibit Abeta aggregation and fibrillation by slowing down the nucleation process in experimental studies. However, the effects of AuNPs on Abeta oligomeric structures are still unclear. In this study, we investigate the conformation of Abeta(16-22) tetramers/octamers in the absence and presence of AuNPs using extensive all-atom molecular-dynamics simulations in explicit solvent. Our studies demonstrate that the addition of AuNPs into Abeta(16-22) solution prevents beta-sheet formation, and the inhibition depends on the concentration of Abeta(16-22) peptides. A detailed analysis of the Abeta(16-22)/Abeta(16-22)/water/AuNPs interactions reveals that AuNPs inhibit the beta-sheet formation resulting from the same physical forces: hydrophobic interactions. Overall, our computational study provides evidence that AuNPs are likely to inhibit Abeta(16-22) and full-length Abeta fibrillation. Thus, this work provides theoretical insights into the development of inorganic nanoparticles as drug candidates for treatment of AD.

29932983|t|Insulin-signaling Pathway Regulates the Degradation of Amyloid beta-protein via Astrocytes.
29932983|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been considered as a metabolic dysfunction disease associated with impaired insulin signaling. Determining the mechanisms underlying insulin signaling dysfunction and resistance in AD will be important for its treatment. Impaired clearance of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) significantly contributes to amyloid accumulation, which is typically observed in the brain of AD patients. Reduced expression of important Abeta-degrading enzymes in the brain, such as neprilysin (NEP) and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), can promote Abeta deposition in sporadic late-onset AD patients. Here, we investigated whether insulin regulates the degradation of Abeta by inducing expression of NEP and IDE in cultured astrocytes. Treatment of astrocytes with insulin significantly reduced cellular NEP levels, but increased IDE expression. The effects of insulin on the expression of NEP and IDE involved activation of an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-mediated pathway. The reduction in cellular NEP levels was associated with NEP secretion into the culture medium, whereas IDE was increased in the cell membranes. Moreover, insulin-treated astrocytes significantly facilitated the degradation of exogenous Abeta within the culture medium. Interestingly, pretreatment of astrocytes with an ERK inhibitor prior to insulin exposure markedly inhibited insulin-induced degradation of Abeta. These results suggest that insulin exposure enhanced Abeta degradation via an increase in NEP secretion and IDE expression in astrocytes, via activation of the ERK-mediated pathway. The inhibition of insulin signaling pathways delayed Abeta degradation by attenuating alterations in NEP and IDE levels and competition with insulin and Abeta. Our results provide further insight into the pathological relevance of insulin resistance in AD development.

29934546|t|New role of P2X7 receptor in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model.
29934546|a|Extracellular aggregates of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides, which are characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD), act as an essential trigger for glial cell activation and the release of ATP, leading to the stimulation of purinergic receptors, especially the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R). However, the involvement of P2X7R in the development of AD is still ill-defined regarding the dual properties of this receptor. Particularly, P2X7R activates the NLRP3 inflammasome leading to the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-1beta; however, P2X7R also induces cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein generating Abeta peptides or the neuroprotective fragment sAPPalpha. We thus explored in detail the functions of P2X7R in AD transgenic mice. Here, we show that P2X7R deficiency reduced Abeta lesions, rescued cognitive deficits and improved synaptic plasticity in AD mice. However, the lack of P2X7R did not significantly affect the release of IL-1beta or the levels of non-amyloidogenic fragment, sAPPalpha, in AD mice. Instead, our results show that P2X7R plays a critical role in Abeta peptide-mediated release of chemokines, particularly CCL3, which is associated with pathogenic CD8+ T cell recruitment. In conclusion, our study highlights a novel detrimental function of P2X7R in chemokine release and supports the notion that P2X7R may be a promising therapeutic target for AD.

29934873|t|Alzheimer's disease pathology propagation by exosomes containing toxic amyloid-beta oligomers.
29934873|a|The gradual deterioration of cognitive functions in Alzheimer's disease is paralleled by a hierarchical progression of amyloid-beta and tau brain pathology. Recent findings indicate that toxic oligomers of amyloid-beta may cause propagation of pathology in a prion-like manner, although the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here we show that small extracellular vesicles, exosomes, from Alzheimer patients' brains contain increased levels of amyloid-beta oligomers and can act as vehicles for the neuron-to-neuron transfer of such toxic species in recipient neurons in culture. Moreover, blocking the formation, secretion or uptake of exosomes was found to reduce both the spread of oligomers and the related toxicity. Taken together, our results imply that exosomes are centrally involved in Alzheimer's disease and that they could serve as targets for development of new diagnostic and therapeutic principles.

29935310|t|Neuroprotective effects of INT-777 against Abeta1-42-induced cognitive impairment, neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and synaptic dysfunction in mice.
29935310|a|Increasing evidence demonstrates that the neurotoxicity of amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition plays a causative role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Herein, we evaluated the neuroprotective effects of 6alpha-ethyl-23(S)-methylcholic acid (S-EMCA, INT-777), a specific G-protein coupled bile acid receptor 1 (TGR5) agonist, in the Abeta1-42-treated mouse model of acute neurotoxicity. Single intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of aggregated Abeta1-42 (410 pmol/mouse; 5 mul) into the mouse brain induced cognitive impairment, neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and synaptic dysfunction. In contrast, INT-777 (1.5 or 3.0 mug/mouse, i.c.v.) significantly improved Abeta1-42-induced cognitive impairment, as reflected by better performance in memory tests. Importantly, INT-777 treatment reversed Abeta1-42-induced TGR5 down-regulation, suppressed the increase of nuclear NF-kappaB p65, and mitigated neuroinflammation, as evidenced by lower proinflammatory cytokines and less Iba1-positive cells in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. INT-777 treatment also pronouncedly suppressed apoptosis through the reduction of TUNEL-positive cells, decreased caspase-3 activation, increased the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, and ameliorated synaptic dysfunction by promoting dendritic spine generation with the upregulation of postsynaptic and presynaptic proteins (PSD95 and synaptophysin) in Abeta1-42-treated mice. Our results indicate that INT-777 has potent neuroprotective effects against Abeta1-42-induced neurotoxicity. Taken together, these findings suggest that the activation of TGR5 could be a novel and promising strategy for the treatment of AD.

29936556|t|Amyloid deposition and CBF patterns predict conversion of mild cognitive impairment to dementia.
29936556|a|Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can include the transition from a normal state to dementia. To explore biomarkers for the development of dementia, we performed an 18-month follow-up study in 28 patients with amnestic MCI. Amyloid deposition was examined using PiB PET, and cerebral blood flow (CBF) was examined using SPECT. Cognitive function was periodically assessed. The rate of conversion to dementia was higher in the PiB-positive/equivocal group (74%) than in the PiB-negative group (33%) (p = 0.041). Perfusion SPECT was performed in 16 patients. MCI patients with an AD-characteristic pattern of reduced CBF had a higher PiB-positive/equivocal rate (82%) than those with a non-AD pattern (20%) (p = 0.018), and patients with an AD pattern had a higher conversion rate (82%) than those with a non-AD pattern (40%) (p = 0.094). Clinically, all PiB-positive converters were diagnosed as having Alzheimer's disease (AD), whereas PiB-negative converters were thought to have some form of dementia other than AD. Amyloid PET is useful for predicting conversion to AD in MCI patients. A pattern analysis of perfusion SPECT findings might also be helpful for predicting conversion to AD, but with a lower specificity.

29940161|t|The impact of preanalytical variables on measuring cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis: A review.
29940161|a|INTRODUCTION: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers have the potential to improve the diagnostic accuracy of Alzheimer's disease, yet there is a lack of harmonized preanalytical CSF handling protocols. METHODS: This systematic review summarizes the current literature on the influence of preanalytical variables on CSF biomarker concentration. We evaluated the evidence for three core CSF biomarkers: beta-amyloid 42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau. RESULTS: The clinically important variables with the largest amount of conflicting data included the temperature at which samples are stored, the time nonfrozen samples can be stored, and possible effects of additives such as detergents, blood contamination, and centrifugation. Conversely, we discovered that there is consensus that tube material has a significant effect. DISCUSSION: A unified CSF handling protocol is recommended to reduce preanalytical variability and facilitate comparison of CSF biomarkers across studies and laboratories. In future, experiments should use a gold standard with fresh CSF collected in low binding tubes.

29945202|t|The Revised National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center's Neuropathology Form-Available Data and New Analyses.
29945202|a|Neuropathologic evaluation remains the gold standard for determining the presence and severity of aging-related neurodegenerative diseases. Researchers at U.S. Alzheimer's Disease Centers (ADCs) have worked for >30 years studying human brains, with the goals of achieving new research breakthroughs. Harmonization and sharing among the 39 current and past ADCs is promoted by the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC), which collects, audits, and disburses ADC-derived data to investigators on request. The past decades have witnessed revised disease definitions paired with dramatic expansion in the granularity and multimodality of the collected data. The NACC database now includes cognitive test scores, comorbidities, drug history, neuroimaging, and links to genomics. Relatively, recent advances in the neuropathologic diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia catalyzed a 2014 update to the NACC Neuropathology Form completed by all ADCs. New focal points include cerebrovascular disease (including arteriolosclerosis, microbleeds, and microinfarcts), hippocampal sclerosis, TDP-43, and FTLD. Here, we provide summary data and analyses to illustrate the potential for both hypothesis-testing and also generating new hypotheses using the NACC Neuropathology data set, which represents one of the largest multi-center databases of carefully curated neuropathologic information that is freely available to researchers worldwide.

29945247|t|Trisomy of human chromosome 21 enhances amyloid-beta deposition independently of an extra copy of APP.
29945247|a|Down syndrome, caused by trisomy of chromosome 21, is the single most common risk factor for early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Worldwide approximately 6 million people have Down syndrome, and all these individuals will develop the hallmark amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer's disease by the age of 40 and the vast majority will go on to develop dementia. Triplication of APP, a gene on chromosome 21, is sufficient to cause early-onset Alzheimer's disease in the absence of Down syndrome. However, whether triplication of other chromosome 21 genes influences disease pathogenesis in the context of Down syndrome is unclear. Here we show, in a mouse model, that triplication of chromosome 21 genes other than APP increases amyloid-beta aggregation, deposition of amyloid-beta plaques and worsens associated cognitive deficits. This indicates that triplication of chromosome 21 genes other than APP is likely to have an important role to play in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis in individuals who have Down syndrome. We go on to show that the effect of trisomy of chromosome 21 on amyloid-beta aggregation correlates with an unexpected shift in soluble amyloid-beta 40/42 ratio. This alteration in amyloid-beta isoform ratio occurs independently of a change in the carboxypeptidase activity of the gamma-secretase complex, which cleaves the peptide from APP, or the rate of extracellular clearance of amyloid-beta. These new mechanistic insights into the role of triplication of genes on chromosome 21, other than APP, in the development of Alzheimer's disease in individuals who have Down syndrome may have implications for the treatment of this common cause of neurodegeneration.

29946028|t|Amyloid clearance defect in ApoE4 astrocytes is reversed by epigenetic correction of endosomal pH.
29946028|a|Endosomes have emerged as a central hub and pathogenic driver of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The earliest brain cytopathology in neurodegeneration, occurring decades before amyloid plaques and cognitive decline, is an expansion in the size and number of endosomal compartments. The strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic AD is the epsilon4 allele of Apolipoprotein E (ApoE4). Previous studies have shown that ApoE4 potentiates presymptomatic endosomal dysfunction and defective endocytic clearance of amyloid beta (Abeta), although how these two pathways are linked at a cellular and mechanistic level has been unclear. Here, we show that aberrant endosomal acidification in ApoE4 astrocytes traps the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP1) within intracellular compartments, leading to loss of surface expression and Abeta clearance. Pathological endosome acidification is caused by epsilon4 risk allele-selective down-regulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger isoform NHE6, which functions as a critical leak pathway for endosomal protons. In vivo, the NHE6 knockout (NHE6KO) mouse model showed elevated Abeta in the brain, consistent with a causal effect. Increased nuclear translocation of histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) in ApoE4 astrocytes, compared with the nonpathogenic ApoE3 allele, suggested a mechanistic basis for transcriptional down-regulation of NHE6. HDAC inhibitors that restored NHE6 expression normalized ApoE4-specific defects in endosomal pH, LRP1 trafficking, and amyloid clearance. Thus, NHE6 is a downstream effector of ApoE4 and emerges as a promising therapeutic target in AD. These observations have prognostic implications for patients who have Christianson syndrome with loss of function mutations in NHE6 and exhibit prominent glial pathology and progressive hallmarks of neurodegeneration.

29947363|t|Abeta under stress: the effects of acidosis, Cu2+-binding, and oxidation on amyloid beta-peptide dimers.
29947363|a|In light of the high affinity of Cu2+ for Alzheimer's Abeta1-42 and its ability to subsequently catalyze the formation of radicals, we examine the effects of Cu2+ binding, Abeta oxidation, and an acidic environment on the conformational dynamics of the smallest Abeta1-42 oligomer, the Abeta1-42 dimer. Transition networks calculated from Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dynamics (H-REMD) simulations reveal that the decreased pH considerably increased the beta-sheet content, whereas Cu2+ binding increased the exposed hydrophobic surface area, both of which can contribute to an increased oligomerization propensity and toxicity.

29948724|t|Treadmill Exercise Ameliorates Spatial Learning and Memory Deficits Through Improving the Clearance of Peripheral and Central Amyloid-Beta Levels.
29948724|a|Aggregated amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides are believed to play a decisive role in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous evidence suggested that exercise contributes to the improvement of cognitive decline and slows down pathogenesis of AD; however, the exact mechanisms for this have not been fully understood. Here, we evaluated the effect of a 4-week moderate treadmill exercise on spatial memory via central and peripheral Abeta clearance mechanisms following developed AD-like neuropathology induced by intra-hippocampal Abeta1-42 injection in male Wistar rats. We found Abeta1-42-treated animals showed spatial learning and memory impairment which was accompanied by increased levels of amyloid plaque load and soluble Abeta1-42 (sAbeta1-42), decreased mRNA and protein expression of neprilysin (NEP), insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1) in the hippocampus. Abeta1-42-treated animals also exhibited a higher level of sAbeta1-42 and a lower level of soluble LRP-1 (sLRP-1) in plasma, as well as a decreased level of LRP-1 mRNA and protein content in the liver. However, exercise training improved the spatial learning and memory deficits, reduced both plaque load and sAbeta1-42 levels, and up-regulated expression of NEP, IDE, and LRP-1 in the hippocampus of Abeta1-42-treated animals. Abeta1-42-treated animals subjected to treadmill exercise also revealed decreased levels of sAbeta1-42 and increased levels of sLRP-1 in plasma, as well as increased levels of LRP-1 mRNA and protein in the liver. In conclusion, our findings suggest that exercise-induced improvement in both of central and peripheral Abeta clearance are likely involved in ameliorating spatial learning and memory deficits in an animal model of AD. Future studies need to determine their relative contribution.

29949507|t|Commutability of the certified reference materials for the standardization of beta-amyloid 1-42 assay in human cerebrospinal fluid: lessons for tau and beta-amyloid 1-40 measurements.
29949507|a|BACKGROUND: The core Alzheimer's disease cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers total tau (T-tau), phosphorylated tau (P-tau), beta-amyloid 1-42 (Abeta42) and beta-amyloid 1-40 (Abeta40) are increasing in importance and are now part of the research criteria for the diagnosis of the disease. The main aim of this study is to evaluate whether a set of certified reference materials (CRMs) are commutable for Abeta42 and to serve as a feasibility study for the other markers. This property is a prerequisite for the establishment of CRMs which will then be used by manufacturers to calibrate their assays against. Once the preanalytical factors have been standardized and proper selection criteria are available for subject cohorts this harmonization between methods will allow for universal cut-offs to be determined. METHODS: Thirty-four individual CSF samples and three different CRMs where analyzed for T-tau, P-tau, Abeta42 and Abeta40, using up to seven different commercially available methods. For Abeta40 and Abeta42 a mass spectrometry-based procedure was also employed. RESULTS: There were strong pairwise correlations between the different methods (Spearman's rho>0.92) for all investigated analytes and the CRMs were not distinguishable from the individual samples. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the CRMs are commutable for the different assays for Abeta42. For the other analytes the results show that it would be feasible to also produce CRMs for these. However, additional studies are needed as the concentration interval for the CRMs were selected based on Abeta42 concentrations only and did in general not cover satisfactory large concentration intervals for the other analytes.

29949947|t|Insights into Structure-Activity Relationships of 3-Arylhydrazonoindolin-2-One Derivatives for Their Multitarget Activity on beta-Amyloid Aggregation and Neurotoxicity.
29949947|a|Despite the controversial outcomes of clinical trials executed so far, the prevention of beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition and neurotoxicity by small molecule inhibitors of Abeta aggregation remains a target intensively pursued in the search of effective drugs for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related neurodegeneration syndromes. As a continuation of previous studies, a series of new 3-(2-arylhydrazono)indolin-2-one derivatives was synthesized and assayed, investigating the effects of substitutions on both the indole core and arylhydrazone moiety. Compared with the reference compound 1, we disclosed equipotent derivatives bearing alkyl substituents at the indole nitrogen, and fairly tolerated bioisosteric replacements at the arylhydrazone moiety. For most of the investigated compounds, the inhibition of Abeta40 aggregation (expressed as pIC50) was found to be correlated with lipophilicity, as assessed by a reversed-phase HPLC method, through a bilinear relationship. The N1-cyclopropyl derivative 28 was tested in cell-based assays of Abeta42 oligomer toxicity and oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide, showing significant cytoprotective effects. This study confirmed the versatility of isatin in preparing multitarget small molecules affecting different biochemical pathways involved in AD.

29950521|t|A flow cytometry-based in vitro assay reveals that formation of apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-amyloid beta complexes depends on ApoE isoform and cell type.
29950521|a|Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a secreted apolipoprotein with three isoforms, E2, E3, and E4, that binds to lipids and facilitates their transport in the extracellular environment of the brain and the periphery. The E4 allele is a major genetic risk factor for the sporadic form of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and studies of human brain and mouse models have revealed that E4 significantly exacerbates the deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta). It has been suggested that this deposition could be attributed to the formation of soluble ApoE isoform-specific ApoE-Abeta complexes. However, previous studies have reported conflicting results regarding the directionality and strength of those interactions. In this study, using a series of flow cytometry assays that maintain the physiological integrity of ApoE-Abeta complexes, we systematically assessed the association of Abeta with ApoE2, E3, or E4. We used ApoE secreted from HEK cells or astrocytes overexpressing ApoE fused with a GFP tag. As a source of soluble Abeta peptide, we used synthetic Abeta40 or Abeta42 or physiological Abeta secreted from CHO cell lines overexpressing WT or V717F variant amyloid precursor protein (APP). We observed significant interactions between the different ApoE isoforms and Abeta, with E4 interacting with Abeta more strongly than the E2 and E3 isoforms. We also found subtle differences depending on the Abeta type and the ApoE-producing cell type. In conclusion, these results indicate that the strength of the ApoE-Abeta association depends on the source of Abeta or ApoE.

29950669|t|A 3D human triculture system modeling neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease.
29950669|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by beta-amyloid accumulation, phosphorylated tau formation, hyperactivation of glial cells, and neuronal loss. The mechanisms of AD pathogenesis, however, remain poorly understood, partially due to the lack of relevant models that can comprehensively recapitulate multistage intercellular interactions in human AD brains. Here we present a new three-dimensional (3D) human AD triculture model using neurons, astrocytes, and microglia in a 3D microfluidic platform. Our model provided key representative AD features: beta-amyloid aggregation, phosphorylated tau accumulation, and neuroinflammatory activity. In particular, the model mirrored microglial recruitment, neurotoxic activities such as axonal cleavage, and NO release damaging AD neurons and astrocytes. Our model will serve to facilitate the development of more precise human brain models for basic mechanistic studies in neural-glial interactions and drug discovery.

29953668|t|Chronic depressive symptomatology and CSF amyloid beta and tau levels in mild cognitive impairment.
29953668|a|OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between chronic subsyndromal symptoms of depression (SSD), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, and neuropsychological performance in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: Participants included 238 older adults diagnosed with MCI from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative repository with cognitive and CSF amyloid beta (Abeta1-42 ), total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) data. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory identified individuals with chronic endorsement (SSD group N = 80) or no endorsement (non-SSD group N = 158) of depressive symptoms across timepoints. CSF biomarker and cognitive performance were evaluated with linear regression models adjusting for age, education, gender, APOE genotype, global cognitive status, and SSD group. RESULTS: As compared to the non-SSD group, the SSD group displayed lower CSF Abeta1-42 levels (beta = -24.293, S.E. = 6.345, P < 0.001). No group differences were observed for CSF t-tau (P = 0.497) or p-tau levels (P = 0.392). Lower CSF Abeta1-42 levels were associated with poorer performance on learning (beta = 0.041, S.E. = 0.018, P = 0.021) and memory (beta = -0.012, S.E. = 0.005, P = 0.031) measures, whereas higher CSF t-tau levels were associated with poorer performance on measures of global cognition (beta = 0.022, S.E = 0.008, P = 0.007) and language (beta = -0.010, S.E = 0.004, P = 0.019). SSD was independently associated with diminished global cognition, learning and memory, language, and executive function performance over and above the effects of CSF biomarkers (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: MCI participants with SSD displayed diminished CSF Abeta1-42 levels but did not differ from non-SSD controls in CSF tau levels. Additionally, CSF biomarkers and SSD independently accounted for variance in cognitive performance, suggesting that these factors may uniquely confer cognitive risk in MCI.

29957469|t|Valproic acid attenuates Abeta25-35-induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells through suppression of mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway.
29957469|a|Aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The purpose of the present study was to identify the protective role of valproic acid (VPA) against beta-amyloid protein fragment 25-35 (Abeta25-35)-caused neurotoxicity in PC12 cells. Different doses of VPA was added to cultures of differentiated PC12 cells, 1 h before Abeta25-35. We found that VPA effectively prevented Abeta25-35-stimulated cytotoxicity through attenuating apoptosis and increasing the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax in PC12 cells. VPA also significantly inhibited the generation of ROS induced by Abeta25-35 in PC12 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, VPA significantly alleviated mitochondrial dysfunction through improvement of mitochondrial membrane potential, inhibition of cytochrome c release, and promotion of mitochondrial ATP synthesis. Furthermore, VPA treatment reduced the expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines and attenuated the activation of NF-kappaB signaling. In conclusion, our results suggested that VPA might serve as a novel protective agent against Abeta25-35-induced cytotoxicity in AD.

29957471|t|Neuroprotective effect of 1-Deoxynojirimycin on cognitive impairment, beta-amyloid deposition, and neuroinflammation in the SAMP8 mice.
29957471|a|beta-amyloid deposition and neuroinflammation play a crucial part in Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, this study was designed to find the effects of 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) purified from mulberry leaves on pathological deposition of Abeta peptides and neuroinflammation in senescence-accelerated-prone mouse 8 (SAMP8) mice. Compared to senescence-accelerated-resistant mouse 1 (SAMR1) mice, SAMP8 mice exhibited conspicuous declines in spatial memory abilities and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tyrosine kinase receptors (TrkB) level in hippocampus; increased Abeta deposition, beta-secretase (BACE1) level, microglia activation and inflammatory factors, including interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in the brain. The SAMP8 mice were treated with DNJ (40 or 160 mg/kg/day) by oral administration for two months. Our results indicated that DNJ treatment improved these changes, and the 160-mg/kg/day DNJ group revealed more significant alleviation. Therefore, DNJ potentially has the neuroprotective effect by inhibiting BACE1 expression, attenuating Abeta deposition, remitting neuroinflammation, and up-regulating the BDNF/TrkB signal pathway in the brain.

29957993|t|Copper Binding Induces Polymorphism in Amyloid-beta Peptide: Results of Computational Models.
29957993|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides are intrinsically disordered peptides, and their aggregation is the hallmark of Alzheimer's disease development. The propensity of the Abeta peptide to intermolecular interactions, the latter favoring different types of oligomers and aggregated forms, has been the object of a huge number of studies. Several facts are now established: the presence of large amount of d-block (M) ions (Zn, Cu, and Fe) in the aggregated forms; the 1:1 M/Abeta ratio favors the formation of amorphous aggregates, with an aggregation rate lower than that in the absence of such ions. In particular, statistical models describing the interactions between copper and amyloid peptides are mandatory to explain the relationship between neurodegeneration, copper dyshomeostasis, and overproduction of reactive oxygen species, the latter event occurring with aging. In this work, we show, by replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations, that a copper ion (Cu2+) bound as in the experimentally observed prevailing coordination enhances the probability of closed structures that hinder the formation of extended intermolecular hydrogen bonds that stabilize fibrillar ordered aggregated forms. On the other hand, this effect enhances the catalytic role of the complex during the lifetime of soluble forms.

29960604|t|Plasma amyloid-beta levels, cerebral atrophy and risk of dementia: a population-based study.
29960604|a|BACKGROUND: Plasma amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels are increasingly studied as a potential accessible marker of cognitive impairment and dementia. However, it remains underexplored whether plasma Abeta levels including the novel Abeta peptide 1-38 (Abeta1-38) relate to preclinical markers of neurodegeneration and risk of dementia. We investigated the association of plasma Abeta1-38, Abeta1-40, and Abeta1-42 levels with imaging markers of neurodegeneration and risk of dementia in a prospective population-based study. METHODS: We analyzed plasma Abeta levels in 458 individuals from the Rotterdam Study. Brain volumes, including gray matter, white matter, and hippocampus, were computed on the basis of 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Dementia and its subtypes were defined on the basis of internationally accepted criteria. RESULTS: A total of 458 individuals (mean age, 67.8 +- 7.7 yr; 232 [50.7%] women) with baseline MRI scans and incident dementia were included. The mean +- SD values of Abeta1-38, Abeta1-40, and Abeta1-42 (in pg/ml) were 19.4 +- 4.3, 186.1 +- 35.9, and 56.3 +- 6.2, respectively, at baseline. Lower plasma Abeta1-42 levels were associated with smaller hippocampal volume (mean difference in hippocampal volume per SD decrease in Abeta1-42 levels, - 0.13; 95% CI, - 0.23 to - 0.04; p = 0.007). After a mean follow-up of 14.8 years (SD, 4.9; range, 4.1-23.5 yr), 79 persons developed dementia, 64 of whom were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Lower levels of Abeta1-38 and Abeta1-42 were associated with increased risk of dementia, specifically AD (HR for AD per SD decrease in Abeta1-38 levels, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00-2.16; HR for AD per SD decrease in Abeta1-42 levels, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.05-1.75) after adjustment for age, sex, education, cardiovascular risk factors, apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele carrier status, and other Abeta isoforms. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that lower plasma Abeta levels were associated with risk of dementia and incident AD. Moreover, lower plasma Abeta1-42 levels were related to smaller hippocampal volume. These results suggest that plasma Abeta1-38 and Abeta1-42 maybe useful biomarkers for identification of individuals at risk of dementia.

29961232|t|Neohesperidin Prevents Abeta25-35-Induced Apoptosis in Primary Cultured Hippocampal Neurons by Blocking the S-Nitrosylation of Protein-Disulphide Isomerase.
29961232|a|A growing body of literature has established a link between the cerebral ischaemic injury and pathological state of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and this correlation indicated that the preventive agent for ischaemia might improve the pathology of AD. Our previous studies have demonstrated that Neohesperidin (NH) exhibited neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia via the down-regulation of Bcl-2, Akt/PI3K and Nrf2 pathways. In the present study, we first confirmed the protective effects of NH on Abeta25-35-induced neurotoxicity on primary cultured hippocampal neurons. We further demonstrated NH attenuated Abeta25-35-induced apoptosis by preventing neurotoxicity associated with lethal UPR and ER stress via blocking S-nitrosylation of protein-disulphide isomerase (PDI). These results suggested that S-nitrosylation of PDI and ER dysfunction might be the synergistic and synchronous pathological process between cerebral ischaemia and AD.

29962410|t|Is Vulnerability of the Dentate Gyrus to Aging and Amyloid-beta1-42 Neurotoxicity Linked with Modified Extracellular Zn2+ Dynamics?
29962410|a|The basal levels of extracellular Zn2+ are in the range of low nanomolar concentrations in the hippocampus and perhaps increase age-dependently. Extracellular Zn2+ dynamics is critical for cognitive activity and excess influx of extracellular Zn2+ into hippocampal neurons is a known cause of cognitive decline. The dentate gyrus is vulnerable to aging in the hippocampus and affected in the early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The reasons remain unclear. Neurogenesis-related apoptosis may induce non-specific neuronal depolarization by efflux of intracellular K+ in the dentate gyrus and be markedly increased along with aging. Extracellular Zn2+ influx into dentate granule cells via high K+-induced perforant pathway excitation leads to cognitive decline. Modified extracellular Zn2+ dynamics in the dentate gyrus of aged rats is linked with vulnerability to cognitive decline. Amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta1-42) is a causative candidate for AD pathogenesis. When Abeta1-42 concentration reaches picomolar in the extracellular compartment in the dentate gyrus, Zn-Abeta1-42 is formed in the extracellular compartment and rapidly taken up into dentate granule cells, followed by Abeta1-42-induced cognitive decline that is due to Zn2+ released from Abeta1-42, suggesting that dentate granule cells are sensitive to extracellular Zn2+-dependent Abeta1-42 toxicity. This paper deals with proposed vulnerability of the dentate gyrus to aging and Abeta1-42 neurotoxicity.

29963623|t|The neuronal S100B protein is a calcium-tuned suppressor of amyloid-beta aggregation.
29963623|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregation and neuroinflammation are consistent features in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and strong candidates for the initiation of neurodegeneration. S100B is one of the most abundant proinflammatory proteins that is chronically up-regulated in AD and is found associated with senile plaques. This recognized biomarker for brain distress may, thus, play roles in amyloid aggregation which remain to be determined. We report a novel role for the neuronal S100B protein as suppressor of Abeta42 aggregation and toxicity. We determined the structural details of the interaction between monomeric Abeta42 and S100B, which is favored by calcium binding to S100B, possibly involving conformational switching of disordered Abeta42 into an alpha-helical conformer, which locks aggregation. From nuclear magnetic resonance experiments, we show that this dynamic interaction occurs at a promiscuous peptide-binding region within the interfacial cleft of the S100B homodimer. This physical interaction is coupled to a functional role in the inhibition of Abeta42 aggregation and toxicity and is tuned by calcium binding to S100B. S100B delays the onset of Abeta42 aggregation by interacting with Abeta42 monomers inhibiting primary nucleation, and the calcium-bound state substantially affects secondary nucleation by inhibiting fibril surface-catalyzed reactions through S100B binding to growing Abeta42 oligomers and fibrils. S100B protects cells from Abeta42-mediated toxicity, rescuing cell viability and decreasing apoptosis induced by Abeta42 in cell cultures. Together, our findings suggest that molecular targeting of S100B could be translated into development of novel approaches to ameliorate AD neurodegeneration.

29964054|t|Rosiglitazone rescues human neural stem cells from amyloid-beta induced ER stress via PPARgamma dependent signaling.
29964054|a|Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) belongs to a family of ligand-activated nuclear receptors known to regulate many crucial physiological and pathological conditions. Indeed, altered PPARgamma transcriptional activity contributes to metabolic syndromes (obesity and hyperglycemia associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus), stroke and neurodegenerative diseases. Various studies suggest that PPARgamma agonists influence neuronal deficits in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients and rodent models of AD. Expression of amyloid-beta (Abeta), a neuropathological marker associated with the pathogenesis of AD neuronal impairment, is inversely correlated with the activation of PPARgamma-dependent neuroprotective responses. Nevertheless, molecular mechanisms by which the effects of PPARgamma agonists in AD remain to be clarified. Here, we explore the PPARgamma signaling pathways and networks that protect against Abeta-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (e.g., caspase 4, Bip, CHOP, ASK1 and ER calcium), cell death (e.g., viability and cytochrome c) and mitochondrial deficiency (e.g., maximal respiratory function, COX activity, and mitochondrial membrane potential) events in the human neural stem cells (hNSCs) treated with Abeta. Co-treatment with GW9662 (an antagonist of PPARgamma) effectively blocked these protective effects by rosiglitazone, providing strong evidence that PPARgamma-dependent signaling rescues hNSCs from Abeta-mediated toxicity. Together, our data suggest activation of PPARgamma pathway might be critical to protecting against AD-related ER stress, ER disequilibrium and mitochondrial deficiency. These findings also improve our understanding of the role of PPARgamma in hNSCs, and may aid in the development and implementation of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of AD.

29964071|t|Agmatine attenuates depressive-like behavior and hippocampal oxidative stress following amyloid beta (Abeta1-40) administration in mice.
29964071|a|Depression is one of the most common psychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and several studies have shown that oxidative stress plays a key role in the etiopathology of both AD and depression. Clinical studies indicate reduced efficacy of the current antidepressants for the treatment of depression in AD. In this regard, agmatine emerges as a neuroprotective agent that presents diverse effects, including antidepressant and antioxidant properties. Here we investigated the antioxidant and antidepressant-like effects of agmatine in a mouse model of AD induced by a single intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of amyloid-beta 1-40 (Abeta). Mice were treated with agmatine (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) once a day during seven consecutive days. The first administration of agmatine was 24 h before the i.c.v. injection of aggregated Abeta 1-40 (400 pmol/mouse). Ten days after Abeta injection, mice were evaluated in the forced swimming test (FST) and open field test for assessment of depressive-like behavior and locomotor activity, respectively. Oxidative parameters were evaluated in the hippocampus of mice 24 h after Abeta injection. Agmatine prevented Abeta-induced increase in hippocampal lipid peroxidation levels and Abeta-induced decrease in catalase activity. In addition, agmatine prevented the increase in immobility time in the FST and the decrease in the latency to the first immobility episode induced by Abeta, without changing locomotion in the open field test. These results demonstrate the antioxidant and antidepressant-like effects of agmatine in a mouse model of AD, indicating the potential of agmatine for the treatment of depression associated to AD.

29966204|t|Do Cardiometabolic Risk Factors Influence Amyloid, Tau, and Neuronal Function in APOE4 Carriers and Non-Carriers in Alzheimer's Disease Trajectory?
29966204|a|Cardiovascular risk could be calculated using Qrisk2. It is suggested that cardiovascular risk factors influence the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, studies have not specifically evaluated the influence of cardiovascular risk using Qrisk2 on neuropathological progression and AD biomarkers. The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of cardiovascular risk factors using Qrisk2 on CSF amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau, 18F-AV45-PET, 18F-FDG-PET, MRI, and cognitive measures in APOE4 negative cognitively normal and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects. 614 cognitively normal, early, and late MCI subjects were selected from the ADNI cohort with a 2-year follow-up. CSF Abeta and tau, 18F-AV45-PET, 18F-FDG-PET, MRI, and cognitive measures along with modified Qrisk2 were evaluated. APOE4 non-carrier, high cardiovascular risk sub-group of early and late MCI and cognitively normal subjects, demonstrated worse biomarker and cognitive profile at baseline and during follow up compared to low cardiovascular risk group. Additionally, similar pattern was also observed in APOE4 carriers. We demonstrated that Qrisk2 and APOE4 were independent predictors of biomarker and clinical progression in AD trajectory. High cardiovascular risk is associated with biomarker changes in APOE4 non-carriers in prodromal AD, which may suggest that treatment of cardiovascular risk is an effective prevention strategy even in APOE4 negative subjects and may influence disease progression independent of amyloid pathology. Demonstration of accelerated neuropathological changes in both APOE4 carriers and non-carriers suggest that focusing on modifiable cardiovascular risk factors is an effective preventative strategy while we eagerly waiting for new treatments.

29966723|t|Up-regulation of NSP3 by Oligomeric Abeta Accelerates Neuronal Death Through Cas-independent Rap1A Activation.
29966723|a|beta-Amyloid (Abeta) plays an important role in the early pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In vitro studies have demonstrated that Abeta oligomers induce hippocampal and neocortical neuronal death. However the neurotoxic mechanisms by which soluble Abeta oligomers cause neuronal damage and death remain to be fully elucidated. To this end, we analyzed the gene expression profile of rat cerebral cortical neurons treated with Abeta oligomers in vitro. Abeta treatment induced the expression of novel SH2-containing protein 3 (NSP3), an adaptor molecule interacting with Cas family proteins. NSP3 expression was upregulated not only in oligomeric-Abeta-treated cultured neurons but also in the neocortex of aged Tg2576 mice. NSP3 overexpression in cultured cortical neurons accelerated neuronal death. The C-terminal region of NSP3 unbound to a Cas protein was necessary for the NSP3-induced acceleration of neuronal death, as was Cas-independent Rap1A activation downstream of NSP3. Moreover, NSP3 RNAi knockdown partially rescued Abeta-oligomer-treated neurons. These results indicate that NSP3 upregulation by soluble Abeta oligomers may accelerate neuronal death via Cas-independent Rap1A activation, implicating NSP3 in the pathogenesis of AD.

29967008|t|Aspirin Induces Lysosomal Biogenesis and Attenuates Amyloid Plaque Pathology in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease via PPARalpha.
29967008|a|Lysosomes play a central role in cellular homeostasis by regulating the cellular degradative machinery. Because aberrant lysosomal function has been associated with multiple lysosomal storage and neurodegenerative disorders, enhancement of lysosomal clearance has emerged as an attractive therapeutic strategy. Transcription factor EB (TFEB) is known as a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and, here, we reveal that aspirin, one of the most widely used medications in the world, upregulates TFEB and increases lysosomal biogenesis in brain cells. Interestingly, aspirin induced the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) and stimulated the transcription of Tfeb via PPARalpha. Finally, oral administration of low-dose aspirin decreased amyloid plaque pathology in both male and female 5X familial Alzheimer's disease (5XFAD) mice in a PPARalpha-dependent fashion. This study reveals a new function of aspirin in stimulating lysosomal biogenesis via PPARalpha and suggests that low-dose aspirin may be used in lowering storage materials in Alzheimer's disease and lysosomal storage disorders.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Developing drugs for the reduction of amyloid beta containing senile plaques, one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), is an important area of research. Aspirin, one of the most widely used medications in the world, activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) to upregulate transcription factor EB and increase lysosomal biogenesis in brain cells. Accordingly, low-dose aspirin decreases cerebral plaque load in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease via PPARalpha. These results reveal a new mode of action of aspirin that may be beneficial for AD and lysosomal storage disorders.

29967578|t|The Relation Between Brain Amyloid Deposition, Cortical Atrophy, and Plasma Biomarkers in Amnesic Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease.
29967578|a|Background: Neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), while the role of brain amyloid deposition in the clinical manifestation or brain atrophy remains unresolved. We aimed to explore the relation between brain amyloid deposition, cortical thickness, and plasma biomarkers. Methods: We used 11C-Pittsburgh compound B-positron emission tomography to assay brain amyloid deposition, magnetic resonance imaging to estimate cortical thickness, and an immunomagnetic reduction assay to measure plasma biomarkers. We recruited 39 controls, 25 subjects with amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and 16 subjects with AD. PiB positivity (PiB+) was defined by the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval of the mean cortical SUVR from six predefined regions (1.0511 in this study). Results: All plasma biomarkers showed significant between-group differences. The plasma Abeta40 level was positively correlated with the mean cortical thickness of both the PiB+ and PiB- subjects. The plasma Abeta40 level of the subjects who were PiB+ was negatively correlated with brain amyloid deposition. In addition, the plasma tau level was negatively correlated with cortical thickness in both the PiB+ and PiB- subjects. Moreover, cortical thickness was negatively correlated with brain amyloid deposition in the PiB+ subjects. In addition, the cut-off point of plasma tau for differentiating between controls and AD was higher in the PiB- group than in the PiB+ group (37.5 versus 25.6 pg/ml, respectively). Lastly, ApoE4 increased the PiB+ rate in the aMCI and control groups. Conclusion: The contributions of brain amyloid deposition to cortical atrophy are spatially distinct. Plasma Abeta40 might be a protective indicator of less brain amyloid deposition and cortical atrophy. It takes more tau pathology to reach the same level of cognitive decline in subjects without brain amyloid deposition, and ApoE4 plays an early role in amyloid pathogenesis.

29972209|t|What Have We Learned from Expedition III and EPOCH Trials? Perspective of the CTAD Task Force.
29972209|a|Although the results were disappointing from two recent clinical trials of amyloid-targeting drugs in mild-to-moderate AD, the trials provided information that will be important for future studies, according to the EU-US CTAD Task Force, which met in November 2017 to discuss the EXPEDITION3 and EPOCH trials. These trials tested two of the predominant drug development strategies for AD: amyloid immunotherapy and BACE inhibition in populations largely composed of mild AD dementia patients. The results of these trials support the emerging consensus that effective amyloid-targeted treatment will require intervention in early, even pre-symptomatic stages of the disease. Further, the Task Force suggested that a refinement of the amyloid hypothesis may be needed and that other hypotheses should be more fully explored. In addition, they called for improved biomarkers and other outcome assessments to detect the earliest changes in the development of AD.

29975836|t|Probing Intermolecular Interactions within the Amyloid beta Trimer Using a Tethered Polymer Nanoarray.
29975836|a|Amyloid oligomers are considered the most neurotoxic species of amyloid aggregates. Spontaneous assembly of amyloids into aggregates is recognized as a major molecular mechanism behind Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders involving protein aggregation. Characterization of such oligomers is extremely challenging but complicated by their transient nature. Previously, we introduced a flexible nanoarray (FNA) method enabling us to probe dimers assembled by the amyloid beta (14-23) [Abeta (14-23)] peptide. The study presented herein modifies and enhances this approach to assemble and probe trimers of Abeta (14-23). A metal-free click chemistry approach was used, in which dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) groups were incorporated at selected sites within the FNA template to click Abeta (14-23) monomers at their terminal azide groups. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) force spectroscopy was employed to characterize the assemblies. The force measurement data demonstrate that the dissociation of the trimer undergoes a stepwise pattern, in which the first monomer dissociates at the rupture force ~48 +- 2.4 pN. The remaining dimer ruptures at the second step at a slightly larger rupture force (~53 +- 3.2 pN). The assembled trimer was found to be quite dynamic, and transient species of this inherently dynamic process were identified.

29980831|t|Amyloid involvement in subcortical regions predicts cognitive decline.
29980831|a|PURPOSE: We estimated whether amyloid involvement in subcortical regions may predict cognitive impairment, and established an amyloid staging scheme based on degree of subcortical amyloid involvement. METHODS: Data from 240 cognitively normal older individuals, 393 participants with mild cognitive impairment, and 126 participants with Alzheimer disease were acquired at Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative sites. To assess subcortical involvement, we analyzed amyloid deposition in amygdala, putamen, and caudate nucleus. We staged participants into a 3-stage model based on cortical and subcortical amyloid involvement: 382 with no cortical or subcortical involvement as stage 0, 165 with cortical but no subcortical involvement as stage 1, and 203 with both cortical and subcortical involvement as stage 2. RESULTS: Amyloid accumulation was first observed in cortical regions and spread down to the putamen, caudate nucleus, and amygdala. In longitudinal analysis, changes in MMSE, ADAS-cog 13, FDG PET SUVR, and hippocampal volumes were steepest in stage 2 followed by stage 1 then stage 0 (p value <0.001). Stage 2 showed steeper changes in MMSE score (beta [SE] = -0.02 [0.004], p < 0.001), ADAS-cog 13 (0.05 [0.01], p < 0.001), FDG PET SUVR (-0.0008 [0.0003], p = 0.004), and hippocampal volumes (-4.46 [0.65], p < 0.001) compared to stage 1. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a downward spreading pattern of amyloid, suggesting that amyloid accumulates first in neocortex followed by subcortical structures. Furthermore, our new finding suggested that an amyloid staging scheme based on subcortical involvement might reveal how differential regional accumulation of amyloid affects cognitive decline through functional and structural changes of the brain.

29989407|t|Hetero-oligomeric Amyloid Assembly and Mechanism: Prion Fragment PrP(106-126) Catalyzes the Islet Amyloid Polypeptide beta-Hairpin.
29989407|a|Protein aggregation is typically attributed to the association of homologous amino acid sequences between monomers of the same protein. Coaggregation of heterogeneous peptide species can occur, however, and is implicated in the proliferation of seemingly unrelated protein diseases in the body. The prion protein fragment (PrP106-126) and human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) serve as an interesting model of nonhomologous protein assembly as they coaggregate, despite a lack of sequence homology. We have applied ion-mobility mass spectrometry, atomic force microscopy, circular dichroism, and high-level molecular modeling to elucidate this important assembly process. We found that the prion fragment not only forms pervasive hetero-oligomeric aggregates with hIAPP but also promotes the transition of hIAPP into its amyloidogenic beta-hairpin conformation. Further, when PrP106-126 was combined with non-amyloidogenic rIAPP, the two formed nearly identical hetero-oligomers to those seen with hIAPP, despite rIAPP containing beta-sheet breaking proline substitutions. Additionally, while rIAPP does not natively form the amyloidogenic beta-hairpin structure, it did so in the presence of PrP106-126 and underwent a conformational transition to beta-sheet in solution. We also find that PrP106-126 forms hetero-oligomers with the IAPP8-20 fragment but not with the "aggregation hot spot" IAPP20-29 fragment. PrP106-126 apparently induces IAPP into a beta-hairpin structure within the PrP:IAPP heterodimer complex and then, through ligand exchange, catalytically creates the amyloidogenic beta-hairpin dimer of IAPP in significantly greater abundance than IAPP does on its own. This is a new mechanistic model that provides a critical foundation for the detailed study of hetero-oligomerization and prion-like proliferation in amyloid systems.

29995422|t|Retinoid X Receptor Alpha Nitro-ligand Z-10 and Its Optimized Derivative Z-36 Reduce beta-Amyloid Plaques in Alzheimer's Disease Mouse Model.
29995422|a|Bexarotene, an agonist of retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRalpha), has been shown to increase the expression of apoE, ABCA1, and ABCG1 by activating RXR/LXR and RXR/PPAR heterodimers, resulting in amyloid beta (Abeta)-protein clearance in the brain of an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model and reversal of mouse cognitive deficits. Nitrostyrene derivative Z-10 is the first identified nitro-ligand of RXRalpha. We hypothesized that Z-10 and its derivatives have the similar effect as bexarotene. A series of Z-10 derivatives were synthesized by introducing methoxyl, hydroxyl, and methoxy groups in 2- or 4-position of naphthalene ring, respectively. Our reporter gene assays showed that the derivatives with substituted groups of methyl and methoxyl in position 2 were more potent to activate Gal4-DBD/RXRalpha-LBD and RXRalpha homodimer as well as RXRalpha heterodimers than the corresponding 4-substituted derivatives. The derivatives with hydroxyl substitution in either 2- or 4-position failed to activate RXRalpha. Consistently, the derivatives with stronger potency of RXRalpha activation had higher RXRalpha binding affinity. Z-10 and its 2-ethyoxyl substituted derivative Z-36 reduced Abeta plaques in both hippocampus and cortex of AD mouse model significantly, of which Z-36 had stronger efficacy. This may due to the stronger ability of Z-36 than Z-10 in activating RXR/LXR and RXR/PPAR heterodimers and inducing ABCA1 and ABCG1 expressions. Thus, the 2- rather than 4-position was the better site for Z-10 modification as to RXRalpha transactivation, and Z-36 is an optimized derivative of Z-10 as to reducing Abeta plaques in AD mouse model.

30001606|t|In vitro neuroprotective effects of naringenin nanoemulsion against beta-amyloid toxicity through the regulation of amyloidogenesis and tau phosphorylation.
30001606|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an increasingly prevalent neurological disorder of the central nervous system. There is growing evidence that amyloidogenesis is a pathological hallmark for AD; this leads to the formation of senile plaques. Naringenin is a bioflavonoid which has neuroprotective effects through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, its clinical usage is limited due to its inefficient transport across biological membranes. In the present study, a naringenin nanoemulsion was prepared and its neuroprotective effects were tested against beta-amyloid induced neurotoxicity in a human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y). The optimised, naringenin-loaded nanoemulsion formulation had a droplet size of 113.83 +- 3.35 nm and around 50 nm, as assessed respectively by photon correlation spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The preparation showed a low polydispersity index (0.312 +- 0.003), a high zeta potential (12.4 +- 1.05) and a high percentage transmittance (97.01%). The neuroprotective activity of naringenin nanoemulsions was determined by assessing their ability to protect SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells against the neurotoxic effect of beta amyloid (Abeta). Abeta-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), amyloid precursor protein (APP), beta-secretase (BACE), total tau and phosphorylated tau (pT231) was also determined. The naringenin loaded nanoemulsion significantly alleviated the direct neurotoxic effects of Abeta on SH-SY5Y cells; this was associated with a down-regulation of APP and BACE expression, indicating reduced amyloidogenesis. Furthermore, it decreased the levels of phosphorylated tau in SH-SY5Y cells exposed to Abeta. These results suggest that a naringenin-loaded nanoemulsion could be a promising agent for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

30003950|t|Identification of an acute functional cross-talk between amyloid-beta and glucocorticoid receptors at hippocampal excitatory synapses.
30003950|a|Amyloid-beta is a peptide released by synapses in physiological conditions and its pathological accumulation in brain structures necessary for memory processing represents a key toxic hallmark underlying Alzheimer's disease. The oligomeric form of Amyloid-beta (Abetaomicron) is now believed to represent the main Amyloid-beta species affecting synapse function. Yet, the exact molecular mechanism by which Abetaomicron modifies synapse function remains to be fully elucidated. There is accumulating evidence that glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) might participate in Abetaomicron generation and activity in the brain. Here, we provide evidence for an acute functional cross-talk between Abeta and GRs at hippocampal excitatory synapses. Using live imaging and biochemical analysis of post-synaptic densities (PSD) in cultured hippocampal neurons, we show that synthetic Abetao (100 nM) increases GR levels in spines and PSD. Also, in these cultured neurons, blocking GRs with two different GR antagonists prevents Abetao-mediated PSD95 increase within the PSD. By analyzing long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in ex vivo hippocampal slices after pharmacologically blocking GR, we also show that GR signaling is necessary for Abetao-mediated LTP impairment, but not Abetao-mediated LTD induction. The necessity of neuronal GRs for Abetao-mediated LTP was confirmed by genetically removing GRs in vivo from CA1 neurons using conditional GR mutant mice. These results indicate a tight functional interplay between GR and Abeta activities at excitatory synapses.

30006735|t|Integrated analysis of human genetic association study and mouse transcriptome suggests LBH and SHF genes as novel susceptible genes for amyloid-beta accumulation in Alzheimer's disease.
30006735|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurological disease that causes dementia in humans. Although the reports of associated pathological genes have been increasing, the molecular mechanism leading to the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in human brain is still not well understood. To identify novel genes that cause accumulation of Abeta in AD patients, we conducted an integrative analysis by combining a human genetic association study and transcriptome analysis in mouse brain. First, we examined genome-wide gene expression levels in the hippocampus, comparing them to amyloid Abeta level in mice with mixed genetic backgrounds. Next, based on a GWAS statistics obtained by a previous study with human AD subjects, we obtained gene-based statistics from the SNP-based statistics. We combined p values from the two types of analysis across orthologous gene pairs in human and mouse into one p value for each gene to evaluate AD susceptibility. As a result, we found five genes with significant p values in this integrated analysis among the 373 genes analyzed. We also examined the gene expression level of these five genes in the hippocampus of independent human AD cases and control subjects. Two genes, LBH and SHF, showed lower expression levels in AD cases than control subjects. This is consistent with the gene expression levels of both the genes in mouse which were negatively correlated with Abeta accumulation. These results, obtained from the integrative approach, suggest that LBH and SHF are associated with the AD pathogenesis.

30010125|t|Amyloid-beta25-35 Upregulates Endogenous Neuroprotectant Neuroglobin via NFkappaB Activation in vitro.
30010125|a|Neuroglobin (Ngb) has been reported to be increased in early and moderately advanced Alzheimer's disease (AD) stages but declined in the severe stage. However, its regulatory mechanisms and pathophysiological roles in the disease remain to be defined. In this study, we found that Ngb expression was significantly upregulated by low dose Abeta25-35, the neurotoxic fragment of Abeta1 - 40 and Abeta1 - 42, but was not further increased by a higher dose of Abeta25-35. Mutation analysis and supershift assay demonstrated that transcription factor Nuclear Factor kappaB (NFkappaB), kappaB2 and kappaB3 sites located in mouse Ngb promoter region were involved in dynamic regulation of Ngb expression in response to different doses of Abeta25-35 stimulation. In addition, we found that suppression of endogenous Ngb expression exacerbated Abeta25-35-induced neuronal cell death and mitochondrial dysfunction. Our results indicate that endogenous Ngb expression may be upregulated by low dose Abeta25-35, which is responsible for protecting against Abeta25-35-mediated neurotoxicity. These experimental findings suggest that upregulation of endogenous Ngb expression might be an effective intervention approach for AD.

30012417|t|Depressive- and anxiety-like phenotypes in young adult APPSwe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice with insensitivity to chronic mild stress.
30012417|a|Early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and depression share many symptoms, but the underlying mechanisms are not clear. Therefore, characterizing the shared and different biological changes between the two disorders will be helpful in making an early diagnosis and planning treatment. In the present study, 8-week-old APPSwe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice received chronic mild stress (CMS) for 8 weeks followed by a series of behavioral, biochemical and pathological analyses. APPSwe/PS1dE9 mice showed depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors, and reduced sociability, accompanied by high levels of soluble beta-amyloid, glial activation, neuroinflammation and brain derived neurotrophic factor signaling disturbance in the hippocampus. Notably, APPSwe/PS1dE9 mice exposure to CMS partially aggravated anxiety-like states rather than depressive-like responses and sociability deficits, with further elevated hippocampal interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels. These results demonstrated that young adult APPSwe/PS1dE9 have depressive- and anxiety-like phenotypes that were resistant to CMS compared to wild-type mice. This finding may help to understand the pathogenic mechanism of psychiatric symptoms associated with early AD.

30014145|t|Assessing Synaptic Density in Alzheimer Disease With Synaptic Vesicle Glycoprotein 2A Positron Emission Tomographic Imaging.
30014145|a|Importance: Synaptic loss is well established as the major structural correlate of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer disease (AD). The ability to measure synaptic density in vivo could accelerate the development of disease-modifying treatments for AD. Synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A is an essential vesicle membrane protein expressed in virtually all synapses and could serve as a suitable target for synaptic density. Objective: To compare hippocampal synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) binding in participants with AD and cognitively normal participants using positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study recruited 10 participants with AD and 11 participants who were cognitively normal between November 2015 and June 2017. We hypothesized a reduction in hippocampal SV2A binding in AD, based on the early degeneration of entorhinal cortical cell projections to the hippocampus (via the perforant path) and hippocampal SV2A reductions that had been observed in postmortem studies. Participants underwent high-resolution PET scanning with ((R)-1-((3-(11C-methyl-11C)pyridin-4-yl)methyl)-4-(3,4,5-trifluorophenyl)pyrrolidin-2-one), a compound more commonly known as 11C-UCB-J, for SV2A. They also underwent high-resolution PET scanning with carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B (11C-PiB) for beta-amyloid, magnetic resonance imaging, and cognitive and neurologic evaluation. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes were 11C-UCB-J-specific binding (binding potential [BPND]) via PET imaging in brain regions of interest in participants with AD and participants who were cognitively normal. Results: Ten participants with AD (5 male and 5 female; mean [SD] age, 72.7 [6.3] years; 10 [100%] beta-amyloid positive) were compared with 11 participants who were cognitively normal (5 male and 6 female; mean [SD] age, 72.9 [8.7] years; 11 [100%] beta-amyloid negative). Participants with AD spanned the disease stages from amnestic mild cognitive impairment (n = 5) to mild dementia (n = 5). Participants with AD had significant reduction in hippocampal SV2A specific binding (41%) compared with cognitively normal participants, as assessed by 11C-UCB-J-PET BPND (cognitively normal participants: mean [SD] BPND, 1.47 [0.37]; participants with AD: 0.87 [0.50]; P = .005). These reductions remained significant after correction for atrophy (ie, partial volume correction; participants who were cognitively normal: mean [SD], 2.71 [0.46]; participants with AD: 2.15 [0.55]; P = .02). Hippocampal SV2A-specific binding BPND was correlated with a composite episodic memory score in the overall sample (R = 0.56; P = .01). Conclusions and Relevance: To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate synaptic density in vivo in AD using 11C-UCB-J-PET imaging. This approach may provide a direct measure of synaptic density, and it therefore holds promise as an in vivo biomarker for AD and as an outcome measure for trials of disease-modifying therapies, particularly those targeted at the preservation and restoration of synapses.

30014553|t|Effect of BDNFVal66Met on disease markers in dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease.
30014553|a|OBJECTIVE: Previous studies suggest that the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met (rs6265) polymorphism may influence symptom onset in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our recent cross-sectional findings suggest that Met66 may influence clinical expression in dominantly inherited AD (DIAD) through its effects on tau. However, it remains unclear whether carriage of Met66 in DIAD results in faster increases in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau and ptau181 , and whether these increases are associated with accelerated brain volume loss and memory decline. METHODS: A total of 211 subjects (101 mutation noncarriers, 110 mutation carriers), who were cognitively normal, as defined by a Clinical Dementia Rating global score of 0, completed assessments of cognitive function, neuroimaging, and CSF sampling over 3.5 years as part of the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network. RESULTS: In mutation carriers, Met66 carriers showed faster memory decline (4x), hippocampal volume loss (16x), and CSF tau and ptau181 increases (6x) than Val66 homozygotes. BDNF did not influence rates of cortical beta-amyloid accumulation or change in CSF Abeta42 levels in mutation carriers. In mutation noncarriers, BDNF genotype had no effect on change in cognition, brain volume, cortical beta-amyloid accumulation, or change in any CSF measures of tau, ptau181 , and CSF Abeta42 . INTERPRETATION: As in sporadic AD, the deleterious effects of beta-amyloid on cognitive function, brain volume loss, and CSF tau in DIAD mutation carriers are less in Val66 homozygotes. The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism should be considered as a potential moderator of clinical trial outcomes in current treatment and prevention trials in DIAD and sporadic AD. Ann Neurol 2018;84:424-435.

30015036|t|Estimates of age-related memory decline are inflated by unrecognized Alzheimer's disease.
30015036|a|Cognitive decline is considered an inevitable consequence of aging; however, estimates of cognitive aging may be influenced negatively by undetected preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to determine the extent to which estimates of cognitive aging were biased by preclinical AD. Cognitively normal older adults (n = 494) with amyloid-beta status determined from positron emission tomography neuroimaging underwent serial neuropsychological assessment at 18-month intervals over 72 months. Estimates of the effects of age on verbal memory, working memory, executive function, and processing speed were derived using linear mixed models. The presence of preclinical AD and clinical progression to mild cognitive impairment or dementia during the study were then added to these models as covariates. Initially, age was associated with decline across all 4 cognitive domains. With the effects of elevated amyloid-beta and clinical progression controlled, age was no longer associated with decline in verbal or working memory. However, the magnitude of decline was reduced only slightly for executive function and was unchanged for processing speed. Thus, considered together, the results of the study indicate that undetected preclinical AD negatively biases estimates of age-related cognitive decline for verbal and working memory.

30015526|t|Amyloid Beta Deposition Could Cause Corneal Epithelial Cell Degeneration Associated with Increasing Apoptosis in APPswePS1 Transgenic Mice.
30015526|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and amyloid beta (Abeta) in cornea and further explore the pathological and ultrastructural changes in corneal epithelium in APPswePS1 transgenic mice. METHODS: Twelve wild type mice were grouped into control group and twelve TgAPPswePS1 mice at least 8 months old were grouped into the young experiment group (Tg-8M group), and another twelve transgenic mice at least 15 months old were selected into the aged experiment group (Tg-15M group). The pathological degeneration, ultrastructural changes, and the expression of APP, Abeta deposition, and the TUNEL reaction in corneal epithelial cells were observed. Western blot analysis was performed to determine expression levels of APP and Abeta with scraped epithelial debridement. All the results were quantified and analyzed. RESULTS: In transgenic mice, the H&E-stained cornea sections demonstrated histopathological changes in corneal epithelial cells with irregular arrangement and the number of cell layers decreased, while normal structure observed in controls. In Tg-15M group, the corneal epithelial cell displaced a significant number of intracellular vacuoles with 1-2 cell layers left. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) further confirmed the dramatic degeneration in corneal epithelium, the microvilli suffered degenerative changes and found with typical fingerpoint-like morphology in controls; however, microspike-like in Tg-15M group, and the number of microvilli decreased considerabely. An APP-positive immunoreaction was detected with a diffuse pattern in the corneal epithelial cells layer, about 3.122 +- 0.596 and 7.372 +- 0.936 fold changes in Tg-8M and Tg-15M groups, respectively, as compared with controls. On corneal flatmount, Abeta deposition found a diffuse pattern in the cytoplasm by fluorescence staining in TgAPPswePS1 with significantly increasing as compared with the controls, but no plaque was found. The apoptosis of TUNEL cells were observed in TgAPPswePS1 mice and increased 16.329 +- 3.542 fold changes in Tg-15M group as compared with controls. CONCLUSION: The APP expression and Abeta deposition might cause cornea epithelial cells degeneration in TgAPPswePS1 mice, associated with apoptosis in basal lamina cells.

30016411|t|Molecular properties underlying regional vulnerability to Alzheimer's disease pathology.
30016411|a|Amyloid deposition and neurofibrillary degeneration in Alzheimer's disease specifically affect discrete neuronal systems, but the underlying mechanisms that render some brain regions more vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease pathology than others remain largely unknown. Here we studied molecular properties underlying these distinct regional vulnerabilities by analysing Alzheimer's disease-typical neuroimaging patterns of amyloid deposition and neurodegeneration in relation to regional gene expression profiles of the human brain. Graded patterns of brain-wide vulnerability to amyloid deposition and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease were estimated by contrasting multimodal amyloid-sensitive PET and structural MRI data between patients with Alzheimer's disease dementia (n = 76) and healthy controls (n = 126) enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Regional gene expression profiles were derived from brain-wide microarray measurements provided by the Allen brain atlas of the adult human brain transcriptome. In a hypothesis-driven analysis focusing on the genes coding for the amyloid precursor (APP) and tau proteins (MAPT), regional expression levels of APP were positively correlated with the severity of regional amyloid deposition (r = 0.44, P = 0.009), but not neurodegeneration (r = 0.01, P = 0.96), whereas the opposite pattern was observed for MAPT (neurodegeneration: r = 0.46, P = 0.006; amyloid: r = 0.08, P = 0.65). Using explorative gene set enrichment analysis, amyloid-vulnerable regions were found to be characterized by relatively low expression levels of gene sets implicated in protein synthesis and mitochondrial respiration. By contrast, neurodegeneration-vulnerable regions were characterized by relatively high expression levels of gene sets broadly implicated in neural plasticity, with biological functions ranging from neurite outgrowth and synaptic contact over intracellular signalling cascades to proteoglycan metabolism. At the individual gene level this data-driven analysis further corroborated the association between neurodegeneration and MAPT expression, and additionally identified associations with known tau kinases (CDK5, MAPK1/ERK2) alongside components of their intracellular (Ras-ERK) activation pathways. Sensitivity analyses showed that these pathology-specific imaging-genetic associations were largely robust against changes in some of the methodological parameters, including variation in the brain donor sample used for estimating regional gene expression profiles, and local variations in the Alzheimer's disease-typical imaging patterns when these were derived from an independent patient cohort (BioFINDER study). These findings highlight that the regionally selective vulnerability to Alzheimer's disease pathology relates to specific molecular-functional properties of the affected neural systems, and that the implicated biochemical pathways largely differ for amyloid accumulation versus neurodegeneration. The data provide novel insights into the complex pathophysiological mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease and point to pathology-specific treatment targets that warrant further exploration in independent studies.

30016458|t|beta-Amyloid Induces Pathology-Related Patterns of Tau Hyperphosphorylation at Synaptic Terminals.
30016458|a|A synergy between beta-amyloid (Abeta) and tau appears to occur in Alzheimer disease (AD), but the mechanisms of interaction, and potential locations, are little understood. This study investigates the possibility of such interactions within the cortical synaptic compartments of APP/PS1 mice. We used label-free quantitative mass spectrometry to study the phosphoproteome of synaptosomes, covering 2400 phosphopeptides and providing an unbiased survey of phosphorylation changes associated with amyloid pathology. Hyperphosphorylation was detected on 36 synaptic proteins, many of which are associated with the cytoskeleton. Importantly, tau is one of the most hyperphosphorylated proteins at the synapse, upregulated at both proline-directed kinase (PDK) sites (S199/S202, S396/S404) and nonPDK sites (S400). These PDK sites correspond to well-known pathological tau epitopes in AD patients, recognized by AT8 and PHF-1 antibodies, respectively. Hyperphosphorylation at S199/S202, a rarely examined combination, was further validated in patient-derived human synaptosomes by immunoblotting. Global surveys of upregulated phosphosites revealed 2 potential kinase motifs, which resemble those of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5, a PDK) and casein kinase II (CK2, a nonPDK). Our data demonstrate that, within synaptic compartments, amyloid pathology is associated with tau hyperphosphorylation at disease-relevant epitopes. This provides a plausible mechanism by which Abeta promotes the spreading of tauopathy.

30018137|a|Some protein and peptide aggregates, such as those of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta), are neurotoxic and have been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases. Abeta accumulates at nanoclusters enriched in neuronal lipids called gangliosides in the presynaptic neuronal membrane, and the resulting oligomeric and/or fibrous forms accelerate the development of Alzheimer's disease. Although the presence of Abeta deposits at such nanoclusters is known, the mechanism of their assembly and the relationship between Abeta secondary structure and topography are still unclear. Here, we first confirmed by atomic force microscopy that Abeta40 fibrils can be obtained by incubating seed-free Abeta40 monomers with a membrane composed of sphingomyelin, cholesterol, and the ganglioside GM1. Using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) reflection-absorption spectroscopy, we then found that these lipid-associated fibrils contained parallel beta-sheets, whereas self-assembled Abeta40 molecules formed antiparallel beta-sheets. We also found that the fibrils obtained at GM1-rich nanoclusters were generated from turn Abeta40 Our findings indicate that Abeta generally self-assembles into antiparallel beta-structures but can also form protofibrils with parallel beta-sheets by interacting with ganglioside-bound Abeta. We concluded that by promoting the formation of parallel beta-sheets, highly ganglioside-enriched nanoclusters help accelerate the elongation of Abeta fibrils. These results advance our understanding of ganglioside-induced Abeta fibril formation in neuronal membranes and may help inform the development of additional therapies for Alzheimer's disease.

30018327|t|Assessment of the efficacy of different procedures that remove and disassemble alpha-synuclein, tau and A-beta fibrils from laboratory material and surfaces.
30018327|a|alpha-synuclein fibrillar polymorphs, Tau and Ass 1-42 fibrillar assemblies have been shown to propagate, amplify and trigger the formation of protein deposits reminiscent of those present within the central nervous system of patients developing synucleinopathies, tauopathies and amyloid plaques after injection intracerebrally, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally or within the blood stream of model animals. They are thus hazardous and there is need for decontamination and inactivation procedures for laboratory surfaces and non-disposable material. We assessed the effectiveness of different reagents to clean and disassemble potentially pathogenic assemblies adsorbed on non-disposable materials in laboratories. We show that commercial detergents and SDS are way more suited to detach alpha-synuclein fibrillar polymorphs, Tau and Ass 1-42 fibrillar assemblies from contaminated surfaces and disassemble the fibrils than methods designed to decrease PrP prion infectivity. Our observations reveal that the choice of the most adapted cleaning procedure for one given protein assembly or fibrillar polymorph should integrate detergent's cleaning efficiency, material compatibility and capacity to dismantle assemblies. We provide an integrated representation where desorption and neutralization efficacy and surface compatibility are combined to facilitate the choice of the most adapted decontamination procedure. This representation, together with good laboratory practices, contributes to reducing potential health hazards associated to manipulating protein assemblies with prion-like properties.

30021071|t|Amyloid-beta Peptide Triggers Membrane Remodeling in Supported Lipid Bilayers Depending on Their Hydrophobic Thickness.
30021071|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease, which is a leading cause of death worldwide. The interaction of Abeta peptides with the lipid bilayers of neuronal cells is a critical step in disease pathogenesis. Recent evidence indicates that lipid bilayer thickness influences Abeta membrane-associated aggregation, while understanding how Abeta interacts with lipid bilayers remains elusive. To address this question, we employed supported lipid bilayer (SLB) platforms composed of different-length phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipids (C12:0 DLPC, C18:1 DOPC, C18:1-C16:0 POPC), and characterized the resulting interactions with soluble Abeta monomers. Quartz crystal microbalance-dissipation (QCM-D) experiments identified concentration-dependent Abeta peptide adsorption onto all tested SLBs, which was corroborated by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments indicating that higher Abeta concentrations led to decreased membrane fluidity. These commonalities pointed to strong Abeta peptide-membrane interactions in all cases. Notably, time-lapsed fluorescence microscopy revealed major differences in Abeta-induced membrane morphological responses depending on SLB hydrophobic thickness. For thicker DOPC and POPC SLBs, membrane remodeling involved the formation of elongated tubule and globular structures as a passive means to regulate membrane stress depending on Abeta concentration. In marked contrast, thin DLPC SLBs were not able to accommodate extensive membrane remodeling. Taken together, our findings reveal that membrane thickness influences the membrane morphological response triggered upon Abeta adsorption.

30023168|t|Impact of partial volume correction on the regional correspondence between in vivo [C-11]PiB PET and postmortem measures of Abeta load.
30023168|a|The positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer Pittsburgh Compound B ([C-11]PiB) demonstrates a high affinity for fibrillary amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregates. However, [C-11]PiB's in vivo sensitivity and specificity is an ongoing area of investigation in correlation studies with postmortem measures of Abeta pathology. One potential confound in PET-to-postmortem correlation studies is the limited spatial resolution of PET and resulting partial volume effects (PVEs). In this work, we evaluated the impact of three partial volume correction (PVC) techniques - the Meltzer, the modified Muller-Gartner, and the Region-Based Voxel-Wise - on correlations between region-matched in vivo [C-11]PiB standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) and postmortem measures of Abeta pathology in a unique cohort of nine subjects. Postmortem Abeta pathology was assessed histologically as percent area coverage of 6-CN-PiB positive and Abeta immunoreactive (4G8 antibody) deposits. The application of all three PVC techniques resulted in minimally reduced PET-to-postmortem correlations relative to no PVC. However, correlations to both 6-CN-PiB and 4G8 percent area across all PVC techniques and no PVC were statistically significant at p < 0.01, suggesting that PVC is of minimal importance in understanding the relationship between Abeta PET and neuropathologically assessed Abeta. Thus, the utility of PVC in Abeta PET imaging should continue to be examined on an application-specific basis.

30024734|t|Retinol-Binding Protein Interferes with Transthyretin-Mediated beta-Amyloid Aggregation Inhibition.
30024734|a|beta-Amyloid (Abeta) aggregation is causally linked to Alzheimer's disease. On the basis of in vitro and transgenic animal studies, transthyretin (TTR) is hypothesized to provide neuroprotection against Abeta toxicity by binding to Abeta and inhibiting its aggregation. TTR is a homotetrameric protein that circulates in blood and cerebrospinal fluid; its normal physiological role is as a carrier for thyroxine and retinol-binding protein (RBP). RBP forms a complex with retinol, and the holoprotein (hRBP) binds with high affinity to TTR. In this study, the role of TTR ligands in TTR-mediated inhibition of Abeta aggregation was investigated. hRBP strongly reduced the ability of TTR to inhibit Abeta aggregation. The effect was not due to competition between Abeta and hRBP for binding to TTR, as Abeta bound equally well to TTR-hRBP complexes and TTR. hRBP is known to stabilize the TTR tetrameric structure. We show that Abeta partially destabilizes TTR and that hRBP counteracts this destabilization. Taken together, our results support a mechanism wherein TTR-mediated inhibition of Abeta aggregation requires not only TTR-Abeta binding but also destabilization of TTR quaternary structure.

30025102|t|Ocular Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease: The Role of Anterior Eye and Potential Future Directions.
30025102|a|Globally, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing health and economic challenge that has no effective cure. Recent clinical trials indicate that preclinical treatment may be required but a routine screening tool for AD has been elusive. Hence, a simple, yet sensitive biomarker for preclinical AD, when the disease is most likely to be amenable to treatment, is lacking. Due to several features, the eye has been explored for this purpose and, among the ocular tissues, the retina has received the most attention. Currently, major works investigating the potential AD diagnosis by detecting amyloid-beta (Abeta) signatures in the retinal tissue are underway, while the anterior eye is more accessible for in vivo imaging and examination. This report provides a concise review of current literature on the anterior eye components, including the crystalline lens, cornea, and aqueous humor, in AD. We also discuss the potential for assessment of the corneal nerve structure and regeneration as well as conjunctival tissue for AD-related alterations. The crystalline lens has received considerable attention, but further research is required to confirm whether Abeta accumulates in the lens and whether it mirrors brain neuropathologic changes, particularly in preclinical AD. The rich corneal neural network and conjunctival vasculature also merit exploration in future studies to shed light on their potential association with AD pathologic changes.

30027497|t|The effect of NAD-299 and TCB-2 on learning and memory, hippocampal BDNF levels and amyloid plaques in Streptozotocin-induced memory deficits in male rats.
30027497|a|RATIONALE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive function. The serotonergic system via the 5-HT1A receptor and 5-HT2A receptor is proposed to affect the cognitive process. OBJECTIVE: In the present study, the effects of NAD-299 (5-HT1AR antagonist) and TCB-2 (5-HT2AR agonist) on learning and memory processes, hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels, neuronal necrosis, and Abeta plaque production have been investigated on the intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced memory deficits in rats. METHODS: Fifty-four adult male Wistar rats (250-300 g) were divided into six groups (n = 9 in each group): control, sham-operated, AD (icv-STZ (3 mg/kg, 10 mul)), AD+NAD-299 (5 mug/1 mul icv for 30 days), AD+TCB-2 (5 mug/1 mul icv for 30 days), and AD+NAD-299 + TCB-2 (NAD-299 (5 mug/0.5 mul icv) and TCB-2 (5 mug/0.5 mul icv) for 30 days). Following the treatment period, rats were subjected to behavioral tests of learning and memory. Then, hippocampal BDNF, amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaque, and neuronal loss were determined by ELISA Kit, Congo red staining, and Nissl staining, respectively. RESULTS: The results of behavioral tests showed that icv-STZ injection decreased the discrimination index in the novel object recognition (NOR) test. In the passive avoidance learning (PAL) task, icv-STZ injection significantly decreased step-through latency (STLr) and increased time spent in dark compartment (TDC). Treatment with NAD-299, TCB-2, and NAD-299 + TCB-2 attenuated the STZ-induced memory impairment in both NOR and PAL tasks. icv-STZ induced a decrease in hippocampal BDNF levels and increased Abeta plaques production in the brain, whereas treatment with NAD-299, TCB-2, and NAD-299 + TCB-2 reduced Abeta plaques in the brain and increased the hippocampal BDNF level. Results of Nissl staining showed that icv-STZ injection increased neuronal loss in the hippocampus, while treatment with NAD-299, TCB-2, and NAD-299 + TCB-2 reduced hippocampal neurodegeneration. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that 5-HT1AR blockade by NAD-299 and 5-HT2AR activation by TCB-2 improve cognitive dysfunction in icv-STZ-treated rats, and these drugs may potentially prevent the progression of AD.

30028551|t|Neuronal susceptibility to beta-amyloid toxicity and ischemic injury involves histone deacetylase-2 regulation of endophilin-B1.
30028551|a|Histone deacetylases (HDACs) catalyze acetyl group removal from histone proteins, leading to altered chromatin structure and gene expression. HDAC2 is highly expressed in adult brain, and HDAC2 levels are elevated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. We previously reported that neuron-specific splice isoforms of Endophilin-B1 (Endo-B1) promote neuronal survival, but are reduced in human AD brain and mouse models of AD and stroke. Here, we demonstrate that HDAC2 suppresses Endo-B1 expression. HDAC2 knockdown or knockout enhances expression of Endo-B1. Conversely, HDAC2 overexpression decreases Endo-B1 expression. We also demonstrate that neurons exposed to beta-amyloid increase HDAC2 and reduce histone H3 acetylation while HDAC2 knockdown prevents Abeta induced loss of histone H3 acetylation, mitochondrial dysfunction, caspase-3 activation, and neuronal death. The protective effect of HDAC2 knockdown was abrogated by Endo-B1 shRNA and in Endo-B1-null neurons, suggesting that HDAC2-induced neurotoxicity is mediated through suppression of Endo-B1. HDAC2 overexpression also modulates neuronal expression of mitofusin2 (Mfn2) and mitochondrial fission factor (MFF), recapitulating the pattern of change observed in AD. HDAC2 knockout mice demonstrate reduced injury in the middle cerebral artery occlusion with reperfusion (MCAO/R) model of cerebral ischemia demonstrating enhanced neuronal survival, minimized loss of Endo-B1, and normalized expression of Mfn2. These findings support the hypothesis that HDAC2 represses Endo-B1, sensitizing neurons to mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death in stroke and AD.

30029060|t|A novel Abeta epitope vaccine based on bacterium-like particle against Alzheimer's disease.
30029060|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaque accumulation in the brain is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Immunotherapy against Abeta was considered a potential strategy for reducing the Abeta load in the brain. However, none of the Abeta immunotherapies have produced clinically meaningful results to date, due to poor safety or lack of efficacy. Thus, we aimed to design a safe and effective vaccine against AD. In this study, we used bacterium-like particles (BLPs) as carriers and different copy numbers of the Abeta 1-6 peptide as epitopes to design four Abeta active immunization vaccines. The epitopes containing different copy numbers of the Abeta 1-6 peptide were specifically loaded on the surface of BLPs via fusion with a peptidoglycan anchoring domain. These four BLP-based Abeta vaccines successfully induced high levels of Abeta42-specific antibodies in mice. However, none of the vaccines induced a T-cell-mediated immune response. Importantly, the antibodies induced by these four vaccines were effective in blocking Abeta42 oligomer toxicity at the cellular level. Among the four vaccines, 6copy-Abeta 1-6 -PA-BLP was the most effective in inducing Abeta-specific antibodies, indicating that a suitable epitope copy number is critical for high immunogenicity of the BLP-based vaccine. Furthermore, high levels of serum Abeta-specific antibodies could still be detected 3 months after the final administration of 6copy-Abeta 1-6 -PA-BLP. Thus, 6copy-Abeta 1-6 -PA-BLP may be a potential therapeutic treatment for AD.

30029360|t|An integrated strategy to correlate aggregation state, structure and toxicity of Ass 1-42 oligomers.
30029360|a|Despite great efforts, it is not known which oligomeric population of amyloid beta (Ass) peptides is the main neurotoxic mediator in Alzheimer's disease. In vitro and in vivo experiments are challenging, mainly because of the high aggregation tendency of Ass (in particular of Ass 1-42 peptide), as well as because of the dynamic and non covalent nature of the prefibrillar aggregates. As a step forward in these studies, an analytical platform is here proposed for the identification and characterization of Ass 1-42 oligomeric populations resulting from three different sample preparation protocols. To preserve the transient nature of aggregates, capillary electrophoresis is employed for monitoring the oligomerization process in solution until fibril precipitation, which is probed by transmission electron microscopy. Based on characterization studies by ultrafiltration and SDS-PAGE/Western Blot, we find that low molecular weight oligomers build up over time and form bigger aggregates (> dodecamers) and that the kinetics strongly depends on sample preparations. The use of phosphate buffer results to be more aggregating, since trimers are the smallest species found in solution, whereas monomers and dimers are obtained by solubilizing Ass 1-42 in a basic mixture. For the first time, attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is used to assign secondary structure to the separated oligomers. Random coil and/or alpha-helix are most abundant in smaller species, whereas ss-sheet is the predominant conformation in bigger aggregates, which in turn are demonstrated to be responsible for Ass 1-42 toxicity.

30029608|t|The adhesion and migration of microglia to beta-amyloid (Abeta) is decreased with aging and inhibited by Nogo/NgR pathway.
30029608|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is characterized by progressive accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta)-containing amyloid plaques, and microglia play a critical role in internalization and degradation of Abeta. Our previous research confirmed that Nogo-66 binding to Nogo receptors (NgR) expressed on microglia inhibits cell adhesion and migration in vitro. METHODS: The adhesion and migration of microglia isolated from WT and APP/PS1 mice from different ages were measured by adhesion assays and transwells. After NEP1-40 (a competitive antagonist of Nogo/NgR pathway) was intracerebroventricularly administered via mini-osmotic pumps for 2 months in APP/PS1 transgenic mice, microglial recruitment toward Abeta deposits and CD36 expression were determined. RESULTS: In this paper, we found that aging led to a reduction of microglia adhesion and migration to fAbeta1-42 in WT and APP/PS1 mice. The adhesion and migration of microglia to fAbeta1-42 were downregulated by the Nogo, which was mediated by NgR, and the increased inhibitory effects of the Nogo could be observed in aged mice. Moreover, Rho GTPases contributed to the effects of the Nogo on adhesion and migration of microglia to fAbeta1-42 by regulating cytoskeleton arrangement. Furthermore, blocking the Nogo/NgR pathway enhanced recruitment of microglia toward Abeta deposits and expression of CD36 in APP/PS1 mice. CONCLUSION: Taken together, Nogo/NgR pathway could take part in Abeta pathology in AD by modulating microglial adhesion and migration to Abeta and the Nogo/NgR pathway might be an important target for treating AD.

30030113|t|Adrenergic beta receptor activation in the basolateral amygdala, which is intracellular Zn2+-dependent, rescues amyloid beta1-42-induced attenuation of dentate gyrus LTP.
30030113|a|On the basis of the evidence that the basolateral amygdala (BLA) modulates hippocampal memory processes via synaptic plasticity, here we report that adrenergic beta receptor activation in the BLA rescues amyloid beta1-42 (Abeta1-42)-induced attenuation of long-term potentiation (LTP) at perforant pathway-dentate granule cell (DGC) synapses. When 500 muM isoproterenol (2 mul), an adrenergic beta receptor agonist, was injected into the BLA 20 min before LTP induction, LTP was enhanced. Isoproterenol-mediated enhancement of LTP was blocked by co-injection with 100 muM ZnAF-2DA, an intracellular Zn2+ chelator, suggesting that intracellular Zn2+ is required for the intracellular signaling cascade after adrenergic beta receptor activation in the BLA. Abeta1-42-induced attenuation of LTP, which was induced by Abeta1-42 injection into the dentate gyrus 60 min before LTP induction, was rescued by isoproterenol injection into the BLA 20 min before LTP induction, but not by 500 muM phenylephrine (2 mul), an adrenergic alpha1 receptor agonist, injection into the BLA, which did not enhance LTP unlike the case of isoproterenol injection. Interestingly, Abeta1-42-induced attenuation of LTP was also rescued by 100 muM isoproterenol injection into the BLA 20 min before LTP induction, which did not enhance LTP. The present study demonstrates that adrenergic beta receptor activation in the BLA, which is linked with intracellular Zn2+ signaling, rescues Abeta1-42-induced attenuation of dentate gyrus LTP. It is likely that adrenergic beta receptor activation in the BLA is a strategy for rescuing Abeta1-42-induced cognitive decline that is associated with hippocampal synaptic plasticity.

30030126|t|Chronic benzodiazepine suppresses translocator protein and elevates amyloid beta in mice.
30030126|a|Benzodiazepine (BZD) is a commonly prescribed anxiolytic and sedation aid medication, especially in elderly women. However, long-term use of BZD provokes adverse nontherapeutic effects that include movement deficit. Here, we investigated motoric deficit and molecular changes in cerebellum associated with the chronic use of BZD (cBZD) in female mice. We measured neuroprotective translocator protein (TSPO), neurotoxic amyloid beta (Abeta), Abeta-producing presenilin-1 (PS1), and Abeta-degrading neprilysin. We also tested whether cBZD treatment damages mitochondrial membranes by measuring mitochondrial membrane swelling and mitochondrial respiration. Young and old mice received BZD (lorazepam) for 20 days, were tested for motoric function using Rotarod, and then euthanized to collect cerebellum. The major methods were immunoblot and RT-PCR for TSPO, PS1, and neprilysin expressions; ELISA for Abeta level; spectrometry for mitochondrial membrane swelling; XF-respirometry for mitochondrial respiration. cBZD-treated old mice showed poorer motoric function than old control or young cBZD-treated mice. Old mice treated with cBZD showed a decrease in TSPO and neprilysin and an increase in Abeta and PS1 production compared to old control mice. Old cBZD-mice also showed an increase in mitochondrial membrane swelling and a decrease in mitochondrial respiration. These data suggest that cBZD exacerbates motoric aging in a manner that involves diminished TSPO, elevated Abeta, and mitochondrial damage.

30031727|t|Amyloid Precursor Protein Overexpression in Down Syndrome Trophoblast Reduces Cell Invasiveness and Interferes with Syncytialization.
30031727|a|The placentas of Down syndrome (DS) pregnancies exhibit morphologic and functional abnormalities. Although the increase in dosage of certain genes on chromosome 21 has been associated with the DS phenotype, the effects on placenta have seldom been studied. Herein, we examine the expression of four dosage-sensitive genes (APP, ETS2, SOD1, and HMGN1) in normal and DS placentas. We demonstrated significant overexpression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in DS placentas at RNA and protein levels by real-time quantitative PCR, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry. Inducible APP overexpression trophoblast cell line models were established using a Tet-On system. APP induction in HTR-8/SVneo dose-dependently decelerated cell growth, enhanced apoptosis, and reduced cell migration and invasion when compared with the uninduced controls. Concomitantly, decreased beta-human chorionic gonadotropin in the culture medium was also detected on induction. Moreover, although forskolin treatment induced alpha/beta-human chorionic gonadotropin and syncytin expression in BeWo cells, such induction of syncytialization was inhibited by APP overexpression. E-cadherin immunofluorescence also demonstrated a decrease in syncytia formation in forskolin-treated BeWo-overexpressing APP. By liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, proteins related to cell-cell adhesion, protein translation, processing, and folding were found to be up-regulated in APP-induced HTR-8/SVneo clones. Our data demonstrated, for the first time, the effects of increased APP expression in DS placenta.

30031899|t|Degradation of fibrin-beta amyloid co-aggregate: A novel function attributed to ubiquitin.
30031899|a|Human placental extract contains numerous bioactive components that are effective wound healing, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory agents. During our investigation on the therapeutic potency of human placental extract, we have purified ubiquitin-like molecules that showed strong fibrino(geno)lytic activity. Further investigation confirmed similar potency of ubiquitin purified from adult human erythrocyte. Additionally, ubiquitin efficiently degraded disordered amyloid beta 42 peptide (Abeta42) aggregate and fibrin-Abeta42 co-aggregate in vitro and reduced co-aggregate induced cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells as compared to plasmin. Ubiquitin also degraded abnormal co-aggregates of fibrin with other plasma proteins such as fibronectin, albumin, lysozyme, tranthyretin and alpha-synuclein. To elucidate the mechanism of degradation, synthetic peptides (ADG, GKT, DQQ, QRL, LIF, AGK, HLVL) derived from ubiquitin template as well as synthetic ubiquitin (8565.32 Da) were employed. Synthetic ubiquitin completely degraded preformed Abeta 42 aggregate and fibrin-Abeta42 co-aggregate, whereas, the smaller synthetic peptides showed varying degrees of degradation. These observations attribute a novel function of ubiquitin that may be used for degrading abnormal fibrin clots in human body. Thorough investigation might unfold a novel molecular mechanism of ubiquitin in protein homeostasis.

30033276|t|Rosmarinic acid- and curcumin-loaded polyacrylamide-cardiolipin-poly(lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles with conjugated 83-14 monoclonal antibody to protect beta-amyloid-insulted neurons.
30033276|a|Polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) combined with lipids can have profound effects on treatment efficacy in patients with neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). We developed polyacrylamide (PAAM)-cardiolipin (CL)-poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) NPs grafted with surface 83-14 monoclonal antibody (MAb) to carry rosmarinic acid (RA) and curcumin (CUR). This drug delivery system was used to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and enhance the viability of SK-N-MC cells insulted with beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposits. Experimental evidence revealed that an increase in the concentration of 83-14 MAb enhanced the permeability coefficient of RA and CUR using the nanocarriers. The levels of phosphorylated p38 and phosphorylated tau protein at serine 202 in degenerated SK-N-MC cells were in the order: Abeta > (Abeta + RA-CUR) > (Abeta + 83-14 MAb-RA-CUR-PAAM-PLGA NPs) > (Abeta + 83-14 MAb-RA-CUR-PAAM-CL-PLGA NPs)   control. The viability of SK-N-MC cells reduced with time and CL in 83-14 MAb-RA-CUR-PAAM-CL-PLGA NPs advantaged Abeta-targeted delivery of RA-CUR. These results evidenced that the current 83-14 MAb-RA-CUR-PAAM-CL-PLGA NPs can be a promising pharmacotherapy to permeate the BBB and reduce the fibrillar Abeta-induced neurotoxicity.

30036601|t|Menadione sodium bisulfite inhibits the toxic aggregation of amyloid-beta(1-42).
30036601|a|Protein misfolding and aggregation are associated with amyloidosis. The toxic aggregation of amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta42) may disrupt cell membranes and lead to cell death and is thus regarded as a contributing factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD). 1,4-naphthoquinone (NQ) has been shown to exhibit strong anti-aggregation effects on amyloidogenic proteins such as insulin and alpha-synuclein; however, its high toxicity and poor solubility limit its clinical application. Menadione sodium bisulfite (MSB, also known as vitamin K3), is used clinically in China to treat hemorrhagic diseases caused by vitamin K deficiency and globally as a vitamin K supplement. We hypothesized that MSB could inhibit amyloid formation since its backbone structure is similar to NQ. To test our hypothesis, we first investigated the effects of MSB on Abeta42 amyloid formation in vitro. We found that MSB inhibited Abeta42 amyloid formation in a dose dependent manner, delayed the secondary structural conversion of Abeta42 from random coil to ordered beta-sheet, and attenuated the ability of Abeta42 aggregates to disrupt membranes; moreover, the quinone backbone rather than lipophilicity is esstial for the inhibitory effects of MSB. Next, in cells expressing a pathogenic APP mutation (Osaka mutation) that results in the formation of intraneuronal Abeta oligomers, MSB inhibited the intracellular aggregation of Abeta. Moreover, MSB treatment significantly extended the life span of Caenorhabditis elegans CL2120, a strain that expresses human Abeta42. Together, these results suggest that MSB and its derivatives may be further explored as potential therapeutic agents for the prevention or treatment of AD.

30036972|t|Polyphenols Derived from Lychee Seed Suppress Abeta (1-42)-Induced Neuroinflammation.
30036972|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) is commonly recognized as the most important factor that results in neuronal cell death and accelerates the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Increasing evidence suggests that microglia activated by Abeta release an amount of neurotoxic inflammatory cytokines that contribute to neuron death and aggravate AD pathology. In our previous studies, we found that lychee seed fraction (LSF), an active fraction derived from the lychee seed, could significantly improve the cognitive function of AD rats and inhibit Abeta-induced neuroinflammation in vitro, and decrease neuronal injuries in vivo and in vitro. In the current study, we aimed to isolate and identify the specific components in LSF that were responsible for the anti-neuroinflammation effect using preparative high performance liquid chromatography (pre-HPLC), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods. To this end, we confirmed two polyphenols including catechin and procyanidin A2 that could improve the morphological status of BV-2 cells and suppress the release, mRNA levels, and protein expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) through downregulating the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway using ELISA, RT-PCR, and Western blotting methods. Furthermore, catechin and procyanidin A2 could inhibit Abeta-induced apoptosis in BV-2 cells by upregulating Bcl-2 and downregulating Bax protein expression. Therefore, the current study illustrated the active substances in lychee seed, and first reported that catechin and procyanidin A2 could suppress neuroinflammation in Abeta-induced BV-2 cells, which provides detailed insights into the molecular mechanism of catechin and procyanidin A2 in the neuroprotective effect, and their further validations of anti-neuroinflammation in vivo is also essential in future research.

30040721|t|Cerebrospinal Fluid Levels of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Are Associated with Amyloid-beta42 Burden in Alzheimer's Disease.
30040721|a|This study was designed to determine whether the levels of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) components are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of Angiotensin (Ang) II, Ang-(1-7), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), ACE2, Amyloid-beta (Abeta)40, Abeta42, total tau (hTau), and phospho-tau (pTau) were measured in 18 patients with AD and 10 controls. Patients with AD presented decreased levels of ACE when compared with controls. We found a significant positive correlation between ACE and Abeta42 levels among patients. Our results strengthen the hypothesis that ACE is associated with Abeta pathology in AD.

30040727|t|Walnut Supplementation in the Diet Reduces Oxidative Damage and Improves Antioxidant Status in Transgenic Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.
30040727|a|Our previous study has shown beneficial effects of walnuts on memory and learning skills in transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD-tg). To understand underlying mechanism, we studied here whether walnuts can reduce oxidative stress in AD. From 4 months of age, experimental AD-tg mice were fed diets containing 6% (T6) or 9% walnuts (T9) (equivalent to 1 or 1.5 oz, of walnuts per day in humans) for 5, 10, or 15 months. The control groups, i.e., AD-tg (T0) and wild-type (Wt) mice, were fed diets without walnuts. Free radicals, i.e., reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and antioxidant enzymes were assessed in these mice at different ages. AD-tg mice on control diet (T0) showed significant age-dependent increase in ROS levels, lipid peroxidation, and protein oxidation coupled with impaired activities of antioxidant enzymes [superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase] compared to Wt mice. Oxidative stress was significantly reduced in AD-tg mice on diets with walnuts (T6, T9), as evidenced by decreased levels of ROS, lipid peroxidation, and protein oxidation, as well as by enhanced activities of antioxidant enzymes compared to T0 mice. Long-term supplementation with walnuts for 10 or 15 months was more effective in reducing oxidative stress in AD-tg mice. Our findings indicate that walnuts can reduce oxidative stress, not only by scavenging free radicals, but also by protecting antioxidant status, thus leading to reduced oxidative damage to lipids and proteins in AD. Therefore, by reducing oxidative stress, a walnut-enriched diet may help reduce the risk or delay the onset and progression of AD.

30040728|t|Small Vessel Cerebrovascular Pathology Identified by Magnetic Resonance Imaging Is Prevalent in Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Potential Target for Intervention.
30040728|a|BACKGROUND: There is evidence that Alzheimer's disease (AD) has significant cerebrovascular etiopathogenesis. Understanding potentially modifiable risk factors for vascular disease can help design long-term intervention strategies for controlling or preventing cognitive dysfunction attributable to cerebrovascular disease. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the presence and severity of markers of cerebrovascular pathology, its relationship to diagnostic categories of dementia, including AD, and association with the metabolic biomarker homocysteine. METHODS: In a cross-sectional observational study, 340 community-dwelling elders received a clinical evaluation including brain MRI and neuropsychological tests. Dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were diagnosed by consensus committee. Fasting total plasma homocysteine was measured. Statistical analyses were adjusted for demographics and cerebrovascular risk factors. RESULTS: Nearly 25% of those diagnosed with AD had small vessel infarcts (SVI). Periventricular white matter hyperintensity (pvWMHI) was prevalent in participants with AD (61%) or MCI (amnesic 61% and non-amnesic 54%, respectively). Participants with SVI and/or pvWMHI also had greater brain atrophy. Homocysteine concentrations were higher in individuals with cerebrovascular findings than in those without. In individuals with cerebrovascular disease, homocysteine was inversely related to executive function (p = 0.022) and directly related to degree of brain atrophy (p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a significant prevalence of small vessel markers of cerebrovascular pathology in individuals diagnosed with AD, with a significant concurrence between cerebrovascular disease and brain and ventricular atrophy. While current research on AD has focused on amyloid-betapeptide deposition, tau-pathology, and microglial activation and inflammation, greater attention to the cerebrovascular contribution to this neurodegenerative disease presents an additional target for therapeutic prevention and intervention.

30040926|t|Morphological changes induced in erythrocyte by amyloid beta peptide and glucose depletion: A combined atomic force microscopy and biochemical study.
30040926|a|Circulating red blood cells (RBCs) undergo aging, a fundamental physiological phenomenon that regulates their turnover. We show that treatment with beta amyloid peptide 1-42 (Abeta) accelerates the occurrence of morphological and biochemical aging markers in human RBCs and influences the cell metabolism leading to intracellular ATP depletion. The morphological pattern has been monitored using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) imaging and measuring the RBCs' plasma membrane roughness employed as a morphological parameter capable to provide information on the structure and integrity of the membrane-skeleton. Results evidence that Abeta boosts the development of crenatures and proto-spicules simultaneously to acceleration in the weakening of the cell-cytoskeleton contacts and to the induction of peculiar nanoscale features on the cell membrane. Incubation in the presence of glucose can remove all but the latter Abeta-induced effects. Biochemical data demonstrate that contemporaneously to morphological and structural alterations, Abeta and glucose depletion trigger a complex signaling pathway involving caspase 3, protein kinase C (PKC) and nitric oxide derived metabolites. As a whole, the collected data revealed that, the damaging path induced by Abeta in RBC provide a sequence of morphological and functional intermediates following one another along RBC life span, including: (i) an acceleration in the development of shape alteration typically observed along the RBC's aging; (ii) the development of characteristic membrane features on the plasma membrane and (iii) triggering a complex signaling pathway involving caspase 3, PKC and nitric oxide derived metabolites.

30041013|t|The concerted amyloid-beta clearance of LRP1 and ABCB1/P-gp across the blood-brain barrier is linked by PICALM.
30041013|a|The accumulation of neurotoxic amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the brain is a characteristic hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The blood-brain barrier (BBB) provides a large surface area and has been shown to be an important mediator for removal of brain Abeta. Both, the ABC transporter P-glycoprotein (ABCB1/P-gp) and the receptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) have been implicated to play crucial roles in Abeta efflux from brain. Here, with immunoprecipitation experiments, co-immunostainings and dual inhibition of ABCB1/P-gp and LRP1, we show that both proteins are functionally linked, mediating a concerted transcytosis of Abeta through endothelial cells. Late-onset AD risk factor Phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM) is associated with both ABCB1/P-gp and LRP1 representing a functional link and guiding both proteins through the brain endothelium. Together, our results give more mechanistic insight on Abeta transport across the BBB and show that the functional interplay of different clearance proteins is needed for the rapid removal of Abeta from the brain.

30041424|t|Development of Convenient System for Detecting Yeast Cell Stress, Including That of Amyloid Beta.
30041424|a|(1) Background: As a model eukaryote, the study of stress responses in yeast can be employed for studying human health and disease, and the effects of various drugs that may impact health. "Reporting" of stress in yeast has frequently utilised enzymes like beta-galactosidase that require laborious assays for quantitative results. The use of a stress reporter that can be measured quantitatively and with high sensitivity in living cells in a multi-well plate reader is a more desirable approach; (2) Methods: A multi-copy yeast-Escherichia coli shuttle plasmid containing the HSP42 promoter upstream of the mCherry reporter, along with the URA3 selectable marker was constructed and tested; (3) Results: Under certain stress conditions inducing the heat shock response, transformants containing the plasmid produced red fluorescence that could be readily quantitated in a microtitre plate reader. Stresses that produced red fluorescence included exposure to heat shock, copper ions, oligomeric amyloid beta (Abeta42) and fibrillar Abeta42; (4) Conclusions: Being able to conveniently and quantitatively monitor stresses in whole live populations of yeast offers great opportunities to screen compounds and conditions that cause stress, as well as conditions that alleviate stress. While freshly prepared oligomeric amyloid beta has previously been shown to exhibit high toxicity, fibrils have been generally considered to be non-toxic or of low toxicity. In this study, fibrillar amyloid beta has also been shown to induce stress.

30043007|t|Unusual binding-site-specific photophysical properties of a benzothiazole-based optical probe in amyloid beta fibrils.
30043007|a|Optical imaging of amyloid fibrils serves as a cost-effective route for the diagnosis of Alzheimer-like conformational diseases. However, the challenge here is to optimize the binding affinity and photophysical properties of the optical imaging agents in a way specific to certain types of amyloids. In a few occasions it is shown that novel optical imaging agents can be designed to bind to a particular type of amyloid fibril with larger binding affinity and specificity. There is also a recent report on photoluminescent polythiophenes which display photophysical properties that can be used to distinguish the variants or subtypes of amyloids (J. Rasmussen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., 2017, 114(49), 13018-13023). Based on a multiscale modeling approach, here, we report on the complementary aspect that the photophysical properties of a benzothiazole based optical probe (referred to as BTA-3) can be specific to the binding sites in the same amyloid fibrils and we attribute this to its varying electronic structure in different sites. As reported experimentally from competitive binding assay studies for many amyloid staining molecules and tracers, we also show multiple binding sites in amyloid fibrils for this probe. In particular, BTA-3 displayed a red-shift in its low-frequency absorption band only in site-4, a surface site of amyloid fibrils when compared to the spectra in water solvent. In the remaining sites, it exhibited a less significant blue shift for the same absorption band.

30045626|t|Neurochemical Aspects of Alzheimer's Disease and Movement Disturbances: A Theory of beta-Amyloid and tau-Protein.
30045626|a|The pathologic and molecular substrate of people diagnosed with cognitive deficits and movement disturbance may not occur exclusively in the context of a brain region, but it may be expressed in another part of body such as muscle. A large body of research has demonstrated that slow motor performance is associated with cognitive impairment in elderly people. The interdependence between motor dysfunction and cognition decline is still not fully understood. Although several factors have been suggested to give a plausible explanation, beta-amyloid (Abeta) and tau-protein aggregation is a common feature of a number of neurodegenerative disorders which are characterized by both motor and cognitive impairment, and it is assumed that the aggregation process plays a central role in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment and motor dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease. The purpose of the present review is to provide an overview of the available evidence that can help to better elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the relationship between cognitive and movement disturbances by focusing on Abeta and tau-protein.

30046852|t|Use of the PET ligand florbetapir for in vivo imaging of pancreatic islet amyloid deposits in hIAPP transgenic mice.
30046852|a|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Islet amyloid deposits contribute to beta cell dysfunction and death in most individuals with type 2 diabetes but non-invasive methods to determine the presence of these pathological protein aggregates are currently not available. Therefore, we examined whether florbetapir, a radiopharmaceutical agent used for detection of amyloid-beta deposits in the brain, also allows identification of islet amyloid in the pancreas. METHODS: Saturation binding assays were used to determine the affinity of florbetapir for human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) aggregates in vitro. Islet amyloid-prone transgenic mice that express hIAPP in their beta cells and amyloid-free non-transgenic control mice were used to examine the ability of florbetapir to detect islet amyloid deposits in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo. Mice or mouse pancreases were subjected to autoradiographic, histochemical and/or positron emission tomography (PET) analyses to assess the utility of florbetapir in identifying islet amyloid. RESULTS: In vitro, florbetapir bound synthetic hIAPP fibrils with a dissociation constant of 7.9 nmol/l. Additionally, florbetapir bound preferentially to amyloid-containing hIAPP transgenic vs amyloid-free non-transgenic mouse pancreas sections in vitro, as determined by autoradiography (16,475 +- 5581 vs 5762 +- 575 density/unit area, p < 0.05). In hIAPP transgenic and non-transgenic mice fed a high-fat diet for 1 year, intravenous administration of florbetapir followed by PET scanning showed that the florbetapir signal was significantly higher in amyloid-laden hIAPP transgenic vs amyloid-free non-transgenic pancreases in vivo during the first 5 min of the scan (36.83 +- 2.22 vs 29.34 +- 2.03 standardised uptake value x min, p < 0.05). Following PET, pancreases were excised and florbetapir uptake was determined ex vivo by gamma counting. Pancreatic uptake of florbetapir was significantly correlated with the degree of islet amyloid deposition, the latter assessed by histochemistry (r = 0.74, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Florbetapir binds to islet amyloid deposits in a specific and quantitative manner. In the future, florbetapir may be useful as a non-invasive tool to identify islet amyloid deposits in humans.

30047732|t|Nonproductive Binding Modes as a Prominent Feature of Abeta40 Fiber Elongation: Insights from Molecular Dynamics Simulation.
30047732|a|The formation of amyloid fibers has been implicated in a number of neurodegenerative diseases. The growth of amyloid fibers is strongly thermodynamically favorable, but kinetic traps exist where the incoming monomer binds in an incompatible conformation that blocks further elongation. Unfortunately, this process is difficult to follow experimentally at the atomic level. It is also too complex to simulate in full detail and to date has been explored either through coarse-grained simulations, which may miss many important interactions, or full atomic simulations, in which the incoming peptide is constrained to be near the ideal fiber geometry. Here we use an alternate approach starting from a docked complex in which the monomer is from an experimental NMR structure of one of the major conformations in the unbound ensemble, a largely unstructured peptide with the central hydrophobic region in a 310 helix. A 1000 ns full atomic simulation in explicit solvent shows the formation of a metastable intermediate by sequential, concerted movements of both the fiber and the monomer. A Markov state model shows that the unfolded monomer is trapped at the end of the fiber in a set of interconverting antiparallel beta-hairpin conformations. The simulation here may serve as a model for the binding of other non-beta-sheet conformations to amyloid fibers.

30048740|t|Effect of amyloid beta on ATP-binding cassette transporter expression and activity in porcine brain microvascular endothelial cells.
30048740|a|BACKGROUND: Deposition of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta(1-42)) within the brain is characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. Little is known of the effects of Abeta(1-42) on blood-brain barrier (BBB) ATP-binding Cassette (ABC) efflux transporters which influence BBB permeability. The effects of Abeta(1-42) on ABCB1, ABCC5 and ABCG2 activity and expression and pregnane X receptor (PXR) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) transcription factors expression were determined in primary porcine brain endothelial cells (PBECs). METHODS: The effect of Abeta(1-42) on transporter activity was determined by measurement of intracellular accumulation of the fluorescent probes calcein (ABCB1), GS-MF (ABCC5) and Hoechst 33342 (ABCG2). Expression of transporters and transcription factors was assessed by Western blotting. RESULTS: Treatment of PBECs with Abeta(1-42) significantly decreased activity of ABCB1 (Abeta(1-42) at 10 mug/ml, 25 mug/ml and 50 mug/ml), ABCC5 (Abeta(1-42) at 25 mug/ml and 50 mug/ml) and ABCG2 (Abeta(1-42) at 10 mug/ml, 25 mug/ml and 50 mug/ml). Abeta(1-42) also significantly decreased expression of ABCB1 (p < 0.05 at 25 mug/ml and 50 mug/ml), ABCG2 (p < 0.05 at 25 mug/ml and p <= 0.001 at 50 mug/ml), ABCC5 (p < 0.05 at 25 mug/ml and 50 mug/ml), PXR (p < 0.05 at 10 mug/ml, 25 mug/ml and 50 mug/ml Abeta(1-42)) and CAR (p < 0.05 at 25 mug/ml and 50 mug/ml Abeta(1-42)). CONCLUSION: Abeta(1-42) inhibits multiple ABC transporters and PXR and CAR in PBECs. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Abeta(1-42) reduces ABC transporter activity and expression in BBB endothelial cells and has the potential to influence BBB permeability characteristics.

30049645|t|Modeling endophilin-mediated Abeta disposal in glioma cells.
30049645|a|Autophagy dysregulation has emerged in age-related neurological diseases (Ulland et al.; Matheoud et al.; Ashkenazi et al.). Alzheimer Disease (AD), the most common progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques caused by aberrant Abeta metabolism (Qiang et al.; Sevigny et al.; Ittner et al.). Glia constitute the brain immune system and ingest extracellular Abeta for degradation via the autophagy-lysosome machinery (Ries and Sastre; Cho et al.). Here, we model the molecular rationale for this clearance process in glioma cells by showing that miR34a inhibits autophagy-mediated disposal of Abeta fibrils and identifying two novel direct targets of miR34a, endophilin-3 and cathepsin B (CTSB, a previously reported enzyme for Abeta degrading (Sun et al.)). Bioinformatics analyses revealed that endophilin-3 expresses at a significantly lower level in neurodegenerative diseases. Its gain-of-function substantially promotes both uptake and degradation of Abeta while small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated endophilin-3 knockdown slowed down Abeta clearance and blocked autolysosome formation. Mechanistically, gene ontology (GO) analysis of the endophilin-3 interactome identified by mass spectrometry uncovered enriched components involved in actin binding (with the highest score). Importantly, we validated that the actin-binding protein phostensin interacted with endophilin-3. Phostensin knockdown restored endophilin-3-mediated up-regulation of Abeta clearance. Thus, our findings indicate that miR34a inhibits Abeta clearance by targeting endophilin-3 and CTSB at multiple steps including uptake and autophagy-mediated degradation.

30049650|t|Cerebrospinal fluid tau, Abeta, and sTREM2 in Former National Football League Players: Modeling the relationship between repetitive head impacts, microglial activation, and neurodegeneration.
30049650|a|INTRODUCTION: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein analysis may facilitate detection and elucidate mechanisms of neurological consequences from repetitive head impacts (RHI), such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy. We examined CSF concentrations of total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau, and amyloid beta1-42 and their association with RHI in former National Football League (NFL) players. The role of microglial activation (using sTREM2) was examined as a pathogenic mechanism of chronic traumatic encephalopathy. METHODS: Sixty-eight former NFL players and 21 controls underwent lumbar puncture to quantify t-tau, p-tau181, amyloid beta1-42, and sTREM2 in the CSF using immunoassays. The cumulative head impact index estimated RHI. RESULTS: No between-group differences for CSF analytes emerged. In the former NFL players, the cumulative head impact index predicted higher t-tau concentrations (P = .041), and higher sTREM2 levels were associated with higher t-tau concentrations (P = .009). DISCUSSION: In this sample of former NFL players, greater RHI and increased microglial activation were associated with higher CSF t-tau concentrations.

30054439|t|CSF biomarkers of neuroinflammation and cerebrovascular dysfunction in early Alzheimer disease.
30054439|a|OBJECTIVE: To measure CSF levels of biomarkers reflecting microglia and astrocytes activation, neuroinflammation, and cerebrovascular changes and study their associations with the core biomarkers of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology (beta-amyloid [Abeta] and tau), structural imaging correlates, and clinical disease progression over time. METHODS: The study included cognitively unimpaired elderly (n = 508), patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 256), and patients with AD dementia (n = 57) from the longitudinal Swedish BioFINDER cohort. CSF samples were analyzed for YKL-40, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-15, IP-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), vascular adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), placental growth factor, and fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 (Flt-1). MRI data were available from 677 study participants. Longitudinal clinical assessments were conducted in control individuals and patients with MCI (mean follow-up 3 years, range 1-6 years). RESULTS: CSF levels of YKL-40, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, IL-15, and Flt-1 were increased during the preclinical, prodromal, and dementia stages of AD. High levels of these biomarkers were associated with increased CSF levels of total tau, with the associations, especially for YKL-40, being stronger in Abeta-positive individuals. The results were similar for associations between phosphorylated tau and YKL-40, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1. High levels of the biomarkers were also associated with cortical thinning (primarily in the precuneus and superior parietal regions) and with subsequent cognitive deterioration in patients without dementia as measured with Mini-Mental State Examination (YKL-40) and Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (YKL-40, ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and IL-15). Finally, higher levels of CSF YKL-40, ICAM-1, and Flt-1 increased risk of development of AD dementia in patients without dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Neuroinflammation and cerebrovascular dysfunction are early events occurring already at presymptomatic stages of AD and contribute to disease progression.

30055048|t|The cytoplasmic region of the amyloid beta-protein precursor (APP) is necessary and sufficient for the enhanced fast velocity of APP transport by kinesin-1.
30055048|a|Amyloid beta-protein precursor (APP) is transported mainly by kinesin-1 and at a higher velocity than other kinesin-1 cargos, such as Alcadein alpha (Alcalpha); this is denoted by the enhanced fast velocity (EFV). Interaction of the APP cytoplasmic region with kinesin-1, which is essential for EFV transport, is mediated by JNK-interacting protein 1 (JIP1). To determine the roles of interactions between the APP luminal region and cargo components, we monitored transport of chimeric cargo receptors, Alcalpha (luminal)-APP (cytoplasmic) and APP (luminal)-Alcalpha (cytoplasmic). Alcalpha-APP is transported at the EFV, whereas APP-Alcalpha is transported at the same velocity as wild-type Alcalpha. Thus, the cytoplasmic region of APP is necessary and sufficient for the EFV of APP transport by kinesin-1.

30055413|t|Alterations of functional circuitry in aging brain and the impact of mutated APP expression.
30055413|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a disease of aging that results in cognitive impairment, dementia, and death. Pathognomonic features of AD are amyloid plaques composed of proteolytic fragments of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. One type of familial AD occurs when mutant forms of APP are inherited. Both APP and tau are components of the microtubule-based axonal transport system, which prompts the hypothesis that axonal transport is disrupted in AD, and that such disruption impacts cognitive function. Transgenic mice expressing mutated forms of APP provide preclinical experimental systems to study AD. Here, we perform manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging to study transport from hippocampus to forebrain in four cohorts of living mice: young and old wild-type and transgenic mice expressing a mutant APP with both Swedish and Indiana mutations (APPSwInd). We find that transport is decreased in normal aging and further altered in aged APPSwInd plaque-bearing mice. These findings support the hypothesis that transport deficits are a component of AD pathology and thus may contribute to cognitive deficits.

30055660|t|Disclosure of amyloid positron emission tomography results to individuals without dementia: a systematic review.
30055660|a|BACKGROUND: Disclosure of amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) results to individuals without dementia has become standard practice in secondary prevention trials and also increasingly occurs in clinical practice. However, this is controversial given the current lack of understanding of the predictive value of a PET result at the individual level and absence of disease-modifying treatments. In this study, we systematically reviewed the literature on the disclosure of amyloid PET in cognitively normal (CN) individuals and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in both research and clinical settings. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search of four scientific databases. Two independent reviewers screened the identified records and selected relevant articles. Included articles presented either empirical data or theoretical data (i.e. arguments in favor or against amyloid status disclosure). Results from the theoretical data were aggregated and presented per theme. RESULTS: Of the seventeen included studies, eleven reported empirical data and six provided theoretical arguments. There was a large variation in the design of the empirical studies, which were almost exclusively in the context of cognitively normal trial participants, comprising only two prospective cohort studies quantitatively assessing the psychological impact of PET result disclosure which showed a low risk of psychological harm after disclosure. Four studies showed that both professionals and cognitively normal individuals support amyloid PET result disclosure and underlined the need for clear disclosure protocols. From the articles presenting theoretical data, we identified 51 'pro' and 'contra' arguments. Theoretical arguments in favor or against disclosure were quite consistent across population groups and settings. Arguments against disclosure focused on the principle of non-maleficence, whereas its psychological impact and predictive value is unknown. Important arguments in favor of amyloid disclosure are the patients right to know (patient autonomy) and that it enables early future decision making. DISCUSSION: Before amyloid PET result disclosure in individuals without dementia in a research or clinical setting is ready for widespread application, more research is needed about its psychological impact, and its predictive value at an individual level. Finally, communication materials and strategies to support disclosure of amyloid PET results should be further developed and prospectively evaluated.

30059089|t|Detection and characterization at nM concentration of oligomers formed by hIAPP, Abeta(1-40) and their equimolar mixture using SERS and MD simulations.
30059089|a|We report a structural investigation on IAPP, Abeta(1-40) and their equi-molar mixture aggregation pathway at nano-molar concentration using the Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) effect induced by silver metal colloids prepared by laser processes in solution and molecular dynamics simulations. Our data show the ability of silver NPs coupled with SERS to detect secondary structures of IAPP, Abeta(1-40) and their 1 : 1 molar ratio mixture in the oligomeric state. The preparation of silver colloids shows superior performance with respect to chemically prepared nano-particles. SERS spectroscopy shows both selectivity and sensitivity in detecting the secondary structures of hIAPP and Abeta(1-40) and to recognize both proteins in their mixture. On the other hand, molecular dynamics simulations confirm SERS structural data and the given atomistic details about the structural organization of IAPP and Abeta(1-40) oligomers. Our study shows an inhomogeneity in the chemical composition of IAPP/Abeta(1-40) oligomer aggregates.

30059119|t|Dynamic micellar oligomers of amyloid beta peptides play a crucial role in their aggregation mechanisms.
30059119|a|A deep understanding of the early molecular mechanism of amyloid beta peptides (Abeta) is crucial to develop therapeutic and preventive approaches for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using a variety of biophysical techniques, we have found that micelle-like dynamic oligomers are rapidly formed by Abeta40 and Abeta42 above specific critical concentrations. Analysis of the initial aggregation rates at 37  C measured by thioflavin T and Bis-ANS fluorescence using a mass-action micellization model revealed a concentration-dependent switch in the nucleation mechanism. Bimolecular nucleation appears to occur at low peptide concentration while above the critical micellar concentration, the nucleation takes place more efficiently in the micelles. Upon incubation, these micelles mediate a rapid formation of larger, more stable oligomers enriched in beta-sheet structure. These oligomers formed from Abeta40, enriched in amyloid nuclei, acquire a higher capacity to fibrillate than their micellar precursors. Abeta42 can also form similar oligomers but they have lower beta-sheet structure content and lower capacity to fibrillate. On the other hand, a considerable fraction of the Abeta42 peptide forms morphologically distinct oligomers that are unable to fibrillate and show significant effect on SH-SY5Y cell viability. Overall, our results highlight the importance of micellar structures as mediators of amyloid nucleation and contribute to the understanding of the differences between the aggregation pathways of Abeta40 and Abeta42.

30059210|t|Extrinsic Amyloid-Binding Dyes for Detection of Individual Protein Aggregates in Solution.
30059210|a|Protein aggregation is a key molecular feature underlying a wide array of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. To understand protein aggregation in molecular detail, it is crucial to be able to characterize the array of heterogeneous aggregates that are formed during the aggregation process. We present here a high-throughput method to detect single protein aggregates, in solution, from a label-free aggregation reaction, and we demonstrate the approach with the protein associated with Parkinson's disease, alpha-synuclein. The method combines single-molecule confocal microscopy with a range of amyloid-binding extrinsic dyes, including thioflavin T and pentameric formylthiophene acetic acid, and we show that we can observe aggregates at low picomolar concentrations. The detection of individual aggregates allows us to quantify their numbers. Furthermore, we show that this approach also allows us to gain structural insights from the emission intensity of the extrinsic dyes that are bound to aggregates. By analyzing the time evolution of the aggregate populations on a single-molecule level, we then estimate the fragmentation rate of aggregates, a key process that underlies the multiplication of pathological aggregates. We additionally demonstrate that the method permits the detection of these aggregates in biological samples. The capability to detect individual protein aggregates in solution opens up a range of new applications, including exploiting the potential of this method for high-throughput screening of human biofluids for disease diagnosis and early detection.

30059683|t|Morroniside prevents H2O2 or Abeta1-42-induced apoptosis via attenuating JNK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation.
30059683|a|Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) plays a causal role in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Oxidative stress and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) are involved in Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. Morroniside, one active monomer of dry ripe sarcocarp of Cornus officinalis, has shown antioxidant properties in several cell lines. The present study investigated the protective actions of morroniside against the cytotoxicity produced by exposure to H2O2 or Abeta1-42 in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. Exposure of PC12 cells to 150 muM H2O2 or 20 muM Abeta1-42 down-regulated anti-apoptotic protein expression (Bcl-2), up-regulated pro-apoptotic protein expression (Bax, cytochrome C, and cleaved caspase-3), increased JNK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation and finally caused significant cell death. This effect was reversed by pretreatment with morroniside in a dose-dependent manner. Among the selective inhibitors of MAPKs, the JNK inhibitor (SP600125) and p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580) showed steady preventive effect against H2O2 or Abeta1-42-induced apoptosis. The results suggest that different from the selective inhibitors of MAPKs, morroniside can inhibit H2O2 or Abeta1-42-induced apoptotic pathway activation through suppressing its upstream signaling components of JNK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation simultaneously.

30060667|t|Influence of Zeolites on Amyloid-beta Aggregation.
30060667|a|Aggregation of Abeta plays a key role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Unfortunately, the Abeta aggregation mechanism is complex, leading to a structurally diverse population of oligomers and amyloid fibrils. Heterogeneous interfaces have been shown to influence the rate of fibrilization and may be useful tools to bias amyloid formation toward specific structures. In order to better understand how exogenous materials influence Abeta aggregation, Abeta1-40 was exposed to zeolite Y containing different metal cations, including Na+, Mg2+, Fe3+, Zn2+, and Cu2+. NaY, MgY, and FeY, all accelerated the kinetics of fibrilization by increasing the primary nucleation rate, while CuY and ZnY inhibited fibrilization. These kinetic effects were supported through binding affinity measurements, in which ZnY and CuY showed higher association constants than the other zeolites. In addition to influencing the kinetics of fibrilization, the zeolites also affected the intermediate structures along the pathway. Western blots confirmed that Abeta1-40 was arrested at the oligomeric stage in the presence of ZnY and CuY, while continuing to the fibrillary state in the presence of other zeolites. Seeding studies showed that NaY and FeY form on-pathway oligomers, while ZnY formed off-pathway oligomers. Overall, our results show that zeolites can impact the aggregation and speciation of amyloids.

30064520|t|In vivo quantification of neurofibrillary tangles with [18F]MK-6240.
30064520|a|BACKGROUND: Imaging agents capable of quantifying the brain's tau aggregates will allow a more precise staging of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of the present study was to examine the in vitro properties as well as the in vivo kinetics, using gold standard methods, of the novel positron emission tomography (PET) tau imaging agent [18F]MK-6240. METHODS: In vitro properties of [18F]MK-6240 were estimated with autoradiography in postmortem brain tissues of 14 subjects (seven AD patients and seven age-matched controls). In vivo quantification of [18F]MK-6240 binding was performed in 16 subjects (four AD patients, three mild cognitive impairment patients, six healthy elderly individuals, and three healthy young individuals) who underwent 180-min dynamic scans; six subjects had arterial sampling for metabolite correction. Simplified approaches for [18F]MK-6240 quantification were validated using full kinetic modeling with metabolite-corrected arterial input function. All participants also underwent amyloid-PET and structural magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: In vitro [18F]MK-6240 uptake was higher in AD patients than in age-matched controls in brain regions expected to contain tangles such as the hippocampus, whereas no difference was found in the cerebellar gray matter. In vivo, [18F]MK-6240 displayed favorable kinetics with rapid brain delivery and washout. The cerebellar gray matter had low binding across individuals, showing potential for use as a reference region. A reversible two-tissue compartment model well described the time-activity curves across individuals and brain regions. Distribution volume ratios using the plasma input and standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) calculated after the binding approached equilibrium (90 min) were correlated and higher in mild cognitive impairment or AD dementia patients than in controls. Reliability analysis revealed robust SUVRs calculated from 90 to 110 min, while earlier time points provided inaccurate estimates. CONCLUSIONS: This evaluation shows an [18F]MK-6240 distribution in concordance with postmortem studies and that simplified quantitative approaches such as the SUVR offer valid estimates of neurofibrillary tangle load 90 min post injection. [18F]MK-6240 is a promising tau tracer with the potential to be applied in the disease diagnosis and assessment of therapeutic interventions.

30068637|t|Influence of tau PET, amyloid PET, and hippocampal volume on cognition in Alzheimer disease.
30068637|a|OBJECTIVE: To examine the independent and interactive influences of neuroimaging biomarkers on retrospective cognitive decline. METHODS: A total of 152 middle-aged and older adult participants with at least 2 clinical and cognitive assessments, a Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0 or 0.5, and a flortaucipir (18F-AV-1451) tau PET scan, a florbetapir (18F-AV-45) amyloid PET scan, and a structural MRI scan were recruited from the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center at Washington University in St. Louis. Cognition was assessed with standard measures reflecting episodic memory, executive functioning, semantic fluency, and processing speed. RESULTS: Results from retrospective longitudinal analyses showed that each biomarker had a univariate association with the global cognitive composite; however, when each marker was analyzed in a single statistical model, only tau was a significant predictor of global cognitive decline. There was an interaction between tau and amyloid such that tau-related cognitive decline was worse in individuals with high amyloid. There was also an interaction with hippocampal volume indicating that individuals with high levels of all 3 pathologies exhibited the greatest declines in cognition. Additional analyses within each cognitive domain indicated that tau had the largest negative influence on tests of episodic memory and executive functioning. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these results suggest that increasing levels of tau most consistently relate to declines in cognition preceding biomarker collection. These findings support models of Alzheimer disease (AD) staging that suggest that elevated beta-amyloid alone may be insufficient to produce cognitive change in individuals at risk for AD and support the use of multiple biomarkers to stage AD progression.

30072722|t|Noninvasive 40-Hz light flicker to recruit microglia and reduce amyloid beta load.
30072722|a|Microglia, the primary immune cells of the brain, play a key role in pathological and normal brain function. Growing efforts aim to reveal how these cells may be harnessed to treat both neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and developmental disorders such as schizophrenia and autism. We recently showed that using noninvasive exposure to 40-Hz white-light (4,000 K) flicker to drive 40-Hz neural activity transforms microglia into an engulfing state and reduces amyloid beta, a peptide thought to initiate neurotoxic events in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This article describes how to construct an LED-based light-flicker apparatus, expose animals to 40-Hz flicker and control conditions, and perform downstream assays to study the effects of these stimuli. Light flicker is simple, faster to implement, and noninvasive, as compared with driving 40-Hz activity using optogenetics; however, it does not target specific cell types, as is achievable with optogenetics. This noninvasive approach to driving 40-Hz neural activity should enable further research into the interactions between neural activity, molecular pathology, and the brain's immune system. Construction of the light-flicker system requires ~1 d and some electronics experience or available guidance. The flicker manipulation and assessment can be completed in a few days, depending on the experimental design.

30080038|t|Tyrosine-Generated Nanostructures Initiate Amyloid Cross-Seeding in Proteins Leading to a Lethal Aggregation Trap.
30080038|a|Here, we show that aromatic amino acid tyrosine, under a physiologically mimicking condition, readily forms amyloid-like entities that can effectively drive aggregation of different globular proteins and aromatic residues. Tyrosine self-assembly resulted in the formation of cross-beta rich regular fibrils as well as spheroidal oligomers. Computational data suggest intermolecular interaction between specifically oriented tyrosine molecules mediated through pi-pi stacking and H-bonding interactions, mimicking a cross-beta-like architecture. Both individual protein samples and mixed protein samples underwent aggregation in the presence of tyrosine fibrils, confirming the occurrence of amyloid cross-seeding. The surface of the tyrosine's amyloid like entities was predicted to trap native protein structures, preferably through hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions initiating an aggregation event. Because tyrosine is a precursor to vital neuromodulators, the inherent cross-seeding potential of the tyrosine fibrils may have direct relevance to amyloid-linked pathologies.

30086988|t|Elimination of amyloid precursor protein in senile plaques in the brain of a patient with Alzheimer-type dementia and Down syndrome.
30086988|a|The average lifespan of individuals with Down syndrome has approximately doubled over the past three decades to 55-60 years. To reveal the pathogenic process of Alzheimer-type dementia in individuals with Down syndrome, we immunohistochemically examined senile plaque formation in the cerebral cortex in the autopsy brain and compared findings with our previous studies. We described a 52-year-old female with Down syndrome who developed progressively more frequent myoclonus following cognitive decline and died at the age of 59 years. Her karyotype [46XX, inv(9)(p12q13), i(21)(q10)] included triplication of the gene for amyloid precursor protein and the Down syndrome critical region. On microscopy, very few gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic (GABAergic) neurons, in the form of small granular cells, in the cortex and Purkinje cells in the cerebellum were visible. In our previous study, amyloid precursor protein immunoreactivity was first noted in senile plaques at the age of 32 years. In this patient, even though amyloid beta immunoreactivity was detected in the cores of senile plaques and diffuse plaques, amyloid precursor protein immunoreactivity was not noted in senile plaques in the frontal cortex. Amyloid precursor protein and its derivative amyloid-beta play an important role in the formation of senile plaques and the time course of immunoreactive expression may be related to the pathogenic process of Alzheimer-type dementia.

30089620|t|How early can we diagnose Alzheimer disease (and is it sufficient)? The 2017 Wartenberg lecture.
30089620|a|A seismic shift in our understanding of the ability to diagnose Alzheimer disease (AD) is occurring. For the last several decades, AD has been a clinical-pathologic diagnosis, and this conceptualization of the disease has served the field well. Typically, the clinician would identify a syndrome such as mild cognitive impairment or dementia, and label the condition as "probable AD" since the diagnosis of definite AD could not be made until an autopsy revealed the presence of amyloid plaques and tau-based neurofibrillary tangles. However, with the advent of biomarkers for AD including neuroimaging and CSF, the identification of AD pathology can be made in life, which greatly enhances the ability of clinicians to be precise about the underlying etiology of a clinical syndrome. Hypothetical models of the temporal relation among the pathologic elements and the clinical symptoms have been proposed and have influenced the field enormously. This has enabled clinicians to be specific about the underlying cause of a given clinical syndrome. As such, the diagnostic capability of the clinician is evolving. However, AD pathology is only a component of the puzzle describing the causes of cognitive changes in aging. Most often, there is a multitude of pathologic entities contributing to the neuropathologic explanation of cognitive changes in aging. AD changes contribute important elements to the diagnosis, but the final answer is more complex. The field of aging and dementia will have to incorporate these additional elements.

30092511|t|The effect of amyloid-beta peptide on synaptic plasticity and memory is influenced by different isoforms, concentrations, and aggregation status.
30092511|a|The increase of oligomeric amyloid-beta (oAbeta) has been related to synaptic dysfunction, thought to be the earliest event in Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. Conversely, the suppression of endogenous Abeta impaired synaptic plasticity and memory, suggesting that the peptide is needed in the healthy brain. However, different species, aggregation forms and concentrations of Abeta might differently influence synaptic function/dysfunction. Here, we have tested the contribution of monomeric and oligomeric Abeta42 and Abeta40 at 200 nM and 200 pM concentrations on hippocampal long-term potentiation and spatial memory. We found that, when at 200 nM, oAbeta40, oAbeta42, and monomeric Abeta42 impaired long-term potentiation and memory, whereas only oAbeta42 200 pM enhanced synaptic plasticity and memory and rescued the detrimental effect due to depletion of endogenous Abeta. Interestingly, quantification of monomer-like and oligomer-like species carried out by transmission electron microscopy revealed an increase of the monomer/oligomer ratio in the oAbeta42 200 pM preparation, suggesting that the content of monomers and oligomers depends on the final concentration of the solution.

30097997|t|Therapeutic implications of how TNF links apolipoprotein E, phosphorylated tau, alpha-synuclein, amyloid-beta and insulin resistance in neurodegenerative diseases.
30097997|a|While cytokines such as TNF have long been recognized as essential to normal cerebral physiology, the implications of their chronic excessive production within the brain are now also increasingly appreciated. Syndromes as diverse as malaria and lead poisoning, as well as non-infectious neurodegenerative diseases, illustrate this. These cytokines also orchestrate changes in tau, alpha-synuclein, amyloid-beta levels and degree of insulin resistance in most neurodegenerative states. New data on the effects of salbutamol, an indirect anti-TNF agent, on alpha-synuclein and Parkinson's disease, APOE4 and tau add considerably to the rationale of the anti-TNF approach to understanding, and treating, these diseases. Therapeutic advances being tested, and arguably useful for a number of the neurodegenerative diseases, include a reduction of excess cerebral TNF, whether directly, with a specific anti-TNF biological agent such as etanercept via Batson's plexus, or indirectly via surgically implanting stem cells. Inhaled salbutamol also warrants investigating further across the neurodegenerative disease spectrum. It is now timely to integrate this range of new information across the neurodegenerative disease spectrum, rather than keep seeing it through the lens of individual disease states.

30103329|t|Endocytosis and Transcytosis of Amyloid-beta Peptides by Astrocytes: A Possible Mechanism for Amyloid-beta Clearance in Alzheimer's Disease.
30103329|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides, Abeta40, Abeta42, and recently Abeta25 - 35, have been directly implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have previously shown that all three peptides decrease neuronal viability, but Abeta40 also promotes synaptic disassembling. In this work, we have studied the effects of these peptides on astrocytes in primary culture and found that the three Abeta peptides were internalized by astrocytes and significantly decreased astrocyte viability, while increasing ROS production. Abeta peptide internalization is temperature-dependent, a fact that supports the idea that Abeta peptides are actively endocytosed by astrocytes. However, inhibiting caveolae formation by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin or by silencing caveolin-1 with RNA interference did not prevent Abeta endocytosis, which suggests that Abeta peptides do not use caveolae to enter astrocytes. Conversely, inhibition of clathrin-coated vesicle formation by chlorpromazine or by silencing clathrin with RNA interference significantly decreased Abeta internalization and partially reverted the decrease of astrocyte viability caused by the presence of Abeta. These results suggest that Abeta is endocytosed by clathrin-coated vesicles in astrocytes. Abeta-loaded astrocytes, when co-incubated with non-treated astrocytes in separate wells but with the same incubation medium, promoted cell death in non-treated astrocytes; a fact that was associated with the presence of Abeta inside previously unloaded astrocytes. This phenomenon was inhibited by the presence of chlorpromazine in the co-incubation medium. These results suggest that astrocyte may perform Abeta transcytosis, a process that could play a role in the clearance of Abeta peptides from the brain to cerebrospinal fluid.

30103330|t|Episodic Memory and Learning Dysfunction Over an 18-Month Period in Preclinical and Prodromal Alzheimer's Disease.
30103330|a|Recent meta-analyses suggest that episodic memory impairment associated with preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) equates to 0.15-0.24 standard deviations below that of cognitively healthy older adults. The current study aimed to characterize impairments in verbal acquisition and recall detectable at a single assessment, and investigate how verbal learning and episodic memory deteriorates in preclinical AD. A verbal list-learning task, the International Shopping List Test (ISLT), was administered multiple times over an 18-month period, to three groups of participants: amyloid-beta negative healthy older adults (Abeta- CN; n = 50); Abeta+ positive healthy older adults (preclinical AD; n = 25); and Abeta+ positive individuals diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (prodromal AD; n = 22). At baseline, there was no significant difference between the preclinical AD and control groups rate of acquisition, or total and delayed recall, however all indices were impaired in prodromal AD. Performance on ISLT total score improved in the control group over the 18-month period, but showed a moderate magnitude decline in the preclinical AD group (Cohen's d = - 0.63, [- 1.12, - 0.14]) and the prodromal AD group (Cohen's d = - 0.36, [- 0.94, 0.22]). No significant impairment in acquisition associated with preclinical AD was seen at baseline. Individuals with preclinical AD showed a significantly different performance on the ISLT total score over an 18-month period, compared to those without abnormal Abeta. Individuals with prodromal AD showed substantial impairment on the ISLT at baseline and declined to a greater extent over time.

30103331|t|The Level of Plasma Amyloid-beta40 Is Correlated with Peripheral Transport Proteins in Cognitively Normal Adults: A Population-Based Cross-Sectional Study.
30103331|a|BACKGROUND: Transport proteins, soluble low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (sLRP1), and soluble receptor of advanced glycation end products (sRAGE), play an important role in the clearance of plasma amyloid-beta (Abeta). However, their relationship is not clear. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to explore the relationship between plasma levels of sLRP1, sRAGE, and Abeta in a cross-sectional study. METHODS: A total of 1,185 cognitively normal participants (age above 40) from a village in the suburbs of Xi'an, China were enrolled from October 8, 2014 to March 30, 2015. Plasma Abeta40, Abeta42, sLRP1, and sRAGE were tested using a commercial ELISA. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping was conducted using PCR and sequencing. The relationship between plasma levels of sLRP1, sRAGE, and Abeta was analyzed using Pearson's correlation analysis and multiple linear regression. RESULTS: In the total population, Log sLRP1 and Log sRAGE were positively correlated with plasma Abeta40 (r= 0.103, p < 0.001; r= 0.064, p = 0.027, respectively), but neither were associated with plasma Abeta42. After multivariable adjustment in the regression model, Log sLRP1 and Log sRAGE were still positively related with plasma Abeta40 (beta= 2.969, p < 0.001; beta= 1.936, p = 0.017, respectively) but not Abeta42. Furthermore, the positive correlations between transport proteins and plasma Abeta40 remained significant only in APOEe4 non-carriers after Pearson's analysis and multiple regression analysis after stratification by gene status. CONCLUSION: The concentrations of plasma sLRP1 and sRAGE had a significant impact on the level of plasma Abeta40 in cognitively normal adults, especially in APOEe4 non-carriers. However, the mechanism by which the transport proteins are involved in peripheral Abeta clearance and the relationship between transporters and amyloid burden in the brain needs further validation.

30103547|t|A Bifunctional Anti-Amyloid Blocks Oxidative Stress and the Accumulation of Intraneuronal Amyloid-Beta.
30103547|a|There is growing recognition regarding the role of intracellular amyloid beta (Abeta) in the Alzheimer's disease process, which has been linked with aberrant signaling and the disruption of protein degradation mechanisms. Most notably, intraneuronal Abeta likely underlies the oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction that have been identified as key elements of disease progression. In this study, we employed fluorescence imaging to explore the ability of a bifunctional small molecule to reduce aggregates of intracellular Abeta and attenuate oxidative stress. Structurally, this small molecule is comprised of a nitroxide spin label linked to an amyloidophilic fluorene and is known as spin-labeled fluorene (SLF). The effect of the SLF on intracellular Abeta accumulation and oxidative stress was measured in MC65 cells, a human neuronal cell line with inducible expression of the amyloid precursor protein and in the N2a neuronal cell line treated with exogenous Abeta. Super-resolution microscopy imaging showed SLF decreases the accumulation of intracellular Abeta. Confocal microscopy imaging of MC65 cells treated with a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-sensitive dye demonstrated SLF significantly reduces the intracellular Abeta-induced ROS signal. In order to determine the contributions of the separate SLF moieties to these protective activities, experiments were also carried out on cells with nitroxides lacking the Abeta targeting domain or fluorene derivatives lacking the nitroxide functionality. The findings support a synergistic effect of SLF in counteracting both the conformational toxicity of both endogenous and exogenous Abeta, its promotion of ROS, and Abeta metabolism. Furthermore, these studies demonstrate an intimate link between ROS production and Abeta oligomer formation.

30103961|t|Plasma beta-amyloid1-42 reference values in cognitively normal subjects.
30103961|a|BACKGROUND: In clinical practice, the use of plasma beta-Amyloid1-42 (Abeta1-42) as biomarker for Alzheimer's disease is largely limited by the absence of reference values. The aim of this study was to evaluate Abeta1-42 plasma concentrations in cognitively normal subjects and to propose reference values. METHODS: Plasma samples were obtained from 245 subjects, with a wide age-range (19-89 years), enrolled at the Unit of Laboratory Medicine of the "Azienda Ospedaliera Cardinale G. Panico" (younger subjects) and from a population-based study on aging (GreatAGE study) (older subjects). Three different age-groups were established: young (<= 34), adult (35 <= age <= 64) and old (>64). The Innogenetics Elisa kit for plasma Abeta1-42 was used for the analysis. RESULTS: The mean (SD) concentration of plasma Abeta1-42 was 17.65 (5.71) pg/mL. A positive trend was found in Abeta1-42 levels across the three age groups (p < .0001): young subjects showed values of Abeta1-42 significantly lower than the adult group (p < .0001) and than the old one (p < .0001 overall); no significant differences were found between the adult and the old groups (p = 1.0000). For the entire cohort the lower limit of 90% Reference Interval, double-sided, was 8.12 pg/mL (95% CI 6.77-9.45) and the upper limit was 29.00 pg/mL (95% CI 27.01-31.00). CONCLUSION: The present study proposes reference values for plasma Abeta1-42. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to confirm these results and corroborate the use of these reference values in clinical practice.

30106209|t|Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus are distinct diseases with potential overlapping metabolic dysfunction upstream of observed cognitive decline.
30106209|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are highly prevalent aging-related diseases associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Some findings in human and animal models have linked T2DM to AD-type dementia. Despite epidemiological associations between the T2DM and cognitive impairment, the interrelational mechanisms are unclear. The preponderance of evidence in longitudinal studies with autopsy confirmation have indicated that vascular mechanisms, rather than classic AD-type pathologies, underlie the cognitive decline often seen in self-reported T2DM. T2DM is associated with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease (CVD), and is associated with increased risk of infarcts and small vessel disease in the brain and other organs. Neuropathological examinations of post-mortem brains demonstrated evidence of cerebrovascular disease and little to no correlation between T2DM and beta-amyloid deposits or neurofibrillary tangles. Nevertheless, the mechanisms upstream of early AD-specific pathology remain obscure. In this regard, there may indeed be overlap between the pathologic mechanisms of T2DM/"metabolic syndrome," and AD. More specifically, cerebral insulin processing, glucose metabolism, mitochondrial function, and/or lipid metabolism could be altered in patients in early AD and directly influence symptomatology and/or neuropathology.

30106299|t|Understanding the Twisted Structure of Amyloid Fibrils via Molecular Simulations.
30106299|a|Accumulation and aggregation of amyloid are associated with the pathogenesis of many human diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Therefore, a quantitative understanding of the molecular mechanisms causing different aggregated structures and biomechanical properties of amyloid fibrils could shed some light into the progression of these diseases. In this work, we develop coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) models to simulate the dynamic self-assembly of two types of amyloids (amylin and amyloid beta (Abeta)). We investigate the structural and mechanical properties of different types of aggregated amyloid fibrils. Our simulations demonstrate that amyloid fibrils could result from longitudinal growth of protofilament bundles, confirming one of the hypotheses on the fibril formation. In addition, we find that the persistence length of amylin fibrils increases concurrently with their pitch length, suggesting that the bending stiffness of amylin fibrils becomes larger when the amylin fibrils are less twisted. Similar results are observed for Abeta fibrils. These findings quantify the connection between the structural and the biomechanical properties of the fibrils. The CGMD models developed in this work can be potentially used to examine efficacy of anti-aggregation drugs, which could help in developing new treatments.

30107970|t|Synthesis and evaluation of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-acridone analogues as potential dual inhibitors for amyloid-beta and tau aggregation.
30107970|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau protein are two crucial hallmarks in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Their aggregation forms are thought to be toxic to the neurons in the brain. A series of new 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-acridone analogues were designed, synthesized, and evaluated as potential dual inhibitors for Abeta and tau aggregation. In vitro studies showed that compounds 25-30 (20 muM) with N-methylation of the quinolone ring effectively inhibited Abeta1-42 aggregation by 84.7%-99.5% and tau aggregation by 71.2%-101.8%. Their structure-activity relationships are discussed. In particular, 30 could permeate the blood-brain barrier, bind to Abeta1-42 and tau, inhibit Abeta1-42 beta-sheets formation, and prevent tau aggregation in living cells.

30111136|t|Understanding the microscopic origin behind heterogeneous properties of water confined in and around Abeta17-42 protofilaments.
30111136|a|Aggregation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides in the brain is responsible for one of the most devastating neurodegenerative diseases, namely, Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we have carried out atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to explore the effects of non-uniform structural distortions of Abeta17-42 pre-fibrillar aggregates of different sizes on the microscopic structure and ordering of water molecules confined within their amphiphilic nanocores. The calculations revealed non-uniform peptide-water interactions resulting in simultaneous existence of both highly ordered and disordered water molecules within the spatially heterogeneous confined environment of the protofilament cores. It is found that the high degree of ordering originates from a sizable fraction of doubly coordinated core water molecules, while the randomly oriented ones are those that are coordinated with three neighbors in their first coordination shells. Furthermore, it is quantitatively demonstrated that relative fractions of these two types of water molecules are correlated with the protofilament core topology and the degree of confinement within that. It is proposed that the ordered core waters are likely to stabilize the Abeta protofilaments by screening the residue charges and favoring water-mediated salt bridge formations, while the randomly oriented ones can drive further growth of the protofilaments by being displaced easily during the docking of additional peptides. In that way, both types of core water molecules can play equally important roles in controlling the growth and stability of the Abeta-aggregates.

30112699|t|Marked Age-Related Changes in Brain Iron Homeostasis in Amyloid Protein Precursor Knockout Mice.
30112699|a|Proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) into the Abeta peptide has been an extensively researched mechanism for Alzheimer's disease, but the normal function of the protein is less understood. APP functions to regulate neuronal iron content by stabilizing the surface presentation of ferroportin-the only iron exporter channel of cells. The present study aims to quantify the contribution of APP to brain and peripheral iron by examining the lifetime impact on brain and liver iron levels in APP knockout mice. Consistent with previous reports, we found that wild-type mice exhibited an age-dependent increase in iron and ferritin in the brain, while no age-dependent changes were observed in the liver. APP ablation resulted in an exaggeration of age-dependent iron accumulation in the brain and liver in mice that was assessed at 8, 12, 18, and 22 months of age. Brain ferroportin levels were decreased in APP knockout mice, consistent with a mechanistic role for APP in stabilizing this iron export protein in the brain. Iron elevation in the brain and liver of APP knockout mice correlated with decreased transferrin receptor 1 and increased ferritin protein levels. However, no age-dependent increase in brain ferritin iron saturation was observed in APP-KO mice despite similar protein expression levels potentially explaining the vulnerability of APP-KO mice to parkinsonism and traumatic brain sequelae. Our results support a crucial role of APP in regulating brain and peripheral iron, and show that APP may act to oppose brain iron elevation during aging.

30114415|t|Somatic variants in autosomal dominant genes are a rare cause of sporadic Alzheimer's disease.
30114415|a|INTRODUCTION: A minority of patients with sporadic early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibit de novo germ line mutations in the autosomal dominant genes such as APP, PSEN1, or PSEN2. We hypothesized that negatively screened patients may harbor somatic variants in these genes. METHODS: We applied an ultrasensitive approach based on single-molecule molecular inversion probes followed by deep next generation sequencing of 11 genes to 100 brain and 355 blood samples from 445 sporadic patients with AD (>80% exhibited an early onset, <66 years). RESULTS: We identified and confirmed nine somatic variants (allele fractions: 0.2%-10.8%): two APP, five SORL1, one NCSTN, and one MARK4 variants by independent amplicon-based deep sequencing. DISCUSSION: Two of the SORL1 variant might have contributed to the disease, the two APP variants were interpreted as likely benign and the other variants remained of unknown significance. Somatic variants in the autosomal dominant AD genes may not be a common cause of sporadic AD, including early onset cases.

30115117|t|IgM response against amyloid-beta in aging: a potential peripheral protective mechanism.
30115117|a|BACKGROUND: The immune system plays a major role in the pathogenesis of age-related dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). An insight into age-associated changes in the immune response to amyloid-beta (Abeta) in individuals without AD may be beneficial in identifying mechanisms preventing accumulation of Abeta. METHODS: We examined the response of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs), T cells, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy aged and young subjects to Abeta peptide 1-42, Abeta fibrils, and recombinant, nonaggregated tau-4 protein with a view to understand the role of peripheral immunity in AD. RESULTS: Our studies revealed that DCs from healthy aged subjects display weak reactivity towards the Abeta peptide and no reactivity towards Abeta fibrils and tau compared with their young counterparts. An analysis of old and young PBMCs revealed that there is no significant T-cell memory against Abeta peptide, fibrils, or tau. Remarkably, the plasma levels of IgM antibodies specific to Abeta peptide 1-42 were significantly increased in aged subjects compared with young subjects, while IgG levels were comparable. Abeta peptide-specific IgM and IgG levels were also determined in the plasma of AD subjects compared with age-matched controls to demonstrate that the immune response against Abeta is stronger in AD patients. A decline in Abeta peptide-specific IgM antibodies was observed in AD patients compared with age-matched controls. In contrast, the levels of IgG as well as interleukin-21, the major cytokine involved in class switching, were increased in AD and patients with mild cognitive impairment, indicating a strong immune response against Abeta. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, low immunogenicity of Abeta in healthy controls may prevent inflammation while the generation of specific IgM antibodies may help in the clearance of Abeta in healthy subjects.

30115846|t|Recent Advances by In Silico and In Vitro Studies of Amyloid-beta 1-42 Fibril Depicted a S-Shape Conformation.
30115846|a|The amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta1-42) peptide is produced by proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential reactions that are catalyzed by gamma and beta secretases. Abeta1-42, together with the Tau protein are two principal hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that are related to disease genesis and progression. Abeta1-42 possesses a higher aggregation propensity, and it is able to form fibrils via nucleated fibril formation. To date, there are compounds available that prevent Abeta1-42 aggregation, but none have been successful in clinical trials, possibly because the Abeta1-42 structure and aggregation mechanisms are not thoroughly understood. New molecules have been designed, employing knowledge of the Abeta1-42 structure and are based on preventing or breaking the ionic interactions that have been proposed for formation of the Abeta1-42 fibril U-shaped structure. Recently, a new Abeta1-42 fibril S-shaped structure was reported that, together with its aggregation and catalytic properties, could be helpful in the design of new inhibitor molecules. Therefore, in silico and in vitro methods have been employed to analyze the Abeta1-42 fibril S-shaped structure and its aggregation to obtain more accurate Abeta1-42 oligomerization data for the design and evaluation of new molecules that can prevent the fibrillation process.

30118828|t|Phloroglucinol ameliorates cognitive impairments by reducing the amyloid beta peptide burden and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus of 5XFAD mice.
30118828|a|Among the various causative factors involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), oxidative stress has emerged as an important factor. Phloroglucinol is a polyphenol component of phlorotannin, which is found at sufficient levels in Ecklonia cava (E. cava). Phloroglucinol has been reported to exert antioxidant activities in various tissues. Previously, we reported that the stereotaxic injection of phloroglucinol regulated synaptic plasticity in an AD mouse model. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of oral administration of phloroglucinol in AD. The oral administration of phloroglucinol for 2 months attenuated the impairments in cognitive function observed in 6-month-old 5X familial AD (5XFAD) mice, as assessed with the T-maze and Y-maze tests. The administration of phloroglucinol for 2 months in 5XFAD mice caused a reduction in the number of amyloid plaques and in the protein level of BACE1, a major amyloid precursor protein cleavage enzyme, together with gamma-secretase. Phloroglucinol also restored the reduction in dendritic spine density and the number of mature spines in the hippocampi of 5XFAD mice. In addition, phloroglucinol-administered 5XFAD mice displayed lower protein levels of GFAP and Iba-1 and mRNA levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 compared with vehicle-administered 5XFAD mice. These results demonstrated that phloroglucinol alleviated the neuropathological features and behavioral phenotypes in the 5XFAD mouse model. Taken together, our results suggest that phloroglucinol has therapeutic potential for AD treatment.

30120254|t|Coupled Transmembrane Substrate Docking and Helical Unwinding in Intramembrane Proteolysis of Amyloid Precursor Protein.
30120254|a|Intramembrane-cleaving proteases (I-CLiPs) play crucial roles in physiological and pathological processes, such as Alzheimer's disease and cancer. However, the mechanisms of substrate recognition by I-CLiPs remain poorly understood. The aspartic I-CLiP presenilin is the catalytic subunit of the gamma-secretase complex, which releases the amyloid-beta peptides (Abetas) through intramembrane proteolysis of the transmembrane domain of the amyloid precursor protein (APPTM). Here we used solution NMR to probe substrate docking of APPTM to the presenilin homologs (PSHs) MCMJR1 and MAMRE50, which cleaved APPTM in the NMR tube. Chemical shift perturbation (CSP) showed juxtamembrane regions of APPTM mediate its docking to MCMJR1. Binding of the substrate to I-CLiP decreased the magnitude of amide proton chemical shifts deltaH at the C-terminal half of the substrate APPTM, indicating that the docking to the enzyme weakens helical hydrogen bonds and unwinds the substrate transmembrane helix around the initial epsilon-cleavage site. The APPTM V44M substitution linked to familial AD caused more CSP and helical unwinding around the epsilon-cleavage site. MAMRE50, which cleaved APPTM at a higher rate, also caused more CSP and helical unwinding in APPTM than MCMJR1. Our data suggest that docking of the substrate transmembrane helix and helical unwinding is coupled in intramembrane proteolysis and FAD mutation modifies enzyme/substrate interaction, providing novel insights into the mechanisms of I-CLiPs and AD drug discovery.

30120299|t|Transcriptional network analysis of human astrocytic endfoot genes reveals region-specific associations with dementia status and tau pathology.
30120299|a|The deposition of misfolded proteins, including amyloid beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles is the histopathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The glymphatic system, a brain-wide network of perivascular pathways that supports interstitial solute clearance, is dependent upon expression of the perivascular astroglial water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4). Impairment of glymphatic function in the aging rodent brain is associated with reduced perivascular AQP4 localization, and in human subjects, reduced perivascular AQP4 localization is associated with AD diagnosis and pathology. Using human transcriptomic data, we demonstrate that expression of perivascular astroglial gene products dystroglycan (DAG1), dystrobrevin (DTNA) and alpha-syntrophin (SNTA1), are associated with dementia status and phosphorylated tau (P-tau) levels in temporal cortex. Gene correlation analysis reveals altered expression of a cluster of potential astrocytic endfoot components in human subjects with dementia, with increased expression associated with temporal cortical P-tau levels. The association between perivascular astroglial gene products, including DTNA and megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts 1 (MLC1) with AD status was confirmed in a second human transcriptomic dataset and in human autopsy tissue by Western blot. This suggests changes in the astroglial endfoot domain may underlie vulnerability to protein aggregation in AD.

30121297|t|Cysteine-Independent Inhibition of Alzheimer's Disease-like Paired Helical Filament Assembly by Leuco-Methylthioninium (LMT).
30121297|a|Alzheimer's disease is a tauopathy characterized by pathological fibrillization of tau protein to form the paired helical filaments (PHFs), which constitute neurofibrillary tangles. The methylthioninium (MT) moiety reverses the proteolytic stability of the PHF core and is in clinical development for treatment of Alzheimer's disease in a stable reduced form as leuco-MT. It has been hypothesized that MT acts via oxidation of cysteine residues, which is incompatible with activity in the predominantly reducing environment of living cells. We have shown recently that the PHF-core tau unit assembles spontaneously in vitro to form PHF-like filaments. Here we describe studies using circular dichroism, SDS-PAGE, transmission electron microscopy and site-directed mutagenesis to elucidate the mechanism of action of the MT moiety. We show that MT inhibitory activity is optimal in reducing conditions, that the active moiety is the reduced leuco-MT form of the molecule and that its mechanism of action is cysteine independent.

30124770|t|Genetic variation within endolysosomal system is associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
30124770|a|Late-onset Alzheimer's disease is the most common dementia type, yet no treatment exists to stop the neurodegeneration. Evidence from monogenic lysosomal diseases, neuronal pathology and experimental models suggest that autophagic and endolysosomal dysfunction may contribute to neurodegeneration by disrupting the degradation of potentially neurotoxic molecules such as amyloid-beta and tau. However, it is uncertain how well the evidence from rare disorders and experimental models capture causal processes in common forms of dementia, including late-onset Alzheimer's disease. For this reason, we set out to investigate if autophagic and endolysosomal genes were enriched for genetic variants that convey increased risk of Alzheimer's disease; such a finding would provide population-based support for the endolysosomal hypothesis of neurodegeneration. We quantified the collective genetic associations between the endolysosomal system and Alzheimer's disease in three genome-wide associations studies (combined n = 62 415). We used the Mergeomics pathway enrichment algorithm that incorporates permutations of the full hierarchical cascade of SNP-gene-pathway to estimate enrichment. We used a previously published collection of 891 autophagic and endolysosomal genes (denoted as AphagEndoLyso, and derived from the Lysoplex sequencing platform) as a proxy for cellular processes related to autophagy, endocytosis and lysosomal function. We also investigated a subset of 142 genes of the 891 that have been implicated in Mendelian diseases (MenDisLyso). We found that both gene sets were enriched for genetic Alzheimer's associations: an enrichment score 3.67 standard deviations from the null model (P = 0.00012) was detected for AphagEndoLyso, and a score 3.36 standard deviations from the null model (P = 0.00039) was detected for MenDisLyso. The high enrichment score was specific to the AphagEndoLyso gene set (stronger than 99.7% of other tested pathways) and to Alzheimer's disease (stronger than all other tested diseases). The APOE locus explained most of the MenDisLyso signal (1.16 standard deviations after APOE removal, P = 0.12), but the AphagEndoLyso signal was less affected (3.35 standard deviations after APOE removal, P = 0.00040). Additional sensitivity analyses further indicated that the AphagEndoLyso Gene Set contained an aggregate genetic association that comprised a combination of subtle genetic signals in multiple genes. We also observed an enrichment of Parkinson's disease signals for MenDisLyso (3.25 standard deviations) and for AphagEndoLyso (3.95 standard deviations from the null model), and a brain-specific pattern of gene expression for AphagEndoLyso in the Gene Tissue Expression Project dataset. These results provide evidence that a diffuse aggregation of genetic perturbations to the autophagy and endolysosomal system may mediate late-onset Alzheimer's risk in human populations.

30125493|t|Repurposing Triphenylmethane Dyes to Bind to Trimers Derived from Abeta.
30125493|a|Soluble oligomers of the beta-amyloid peptide, Abeta, are associated with the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Although many small molecules bind to these assemblies, the details of how these molecules interact with Abeta oligomers remain unknown. This paper reports that crystal violet, and other C3 symmetric triphenylmethane dyes, bind to C3 symmetric trimers derived from Abeta17-36. Binding changes the color of the dyes from purple to blue, and causes them to fluoresce red when irradiated with green light. Job plot and analytical ultracentrifugation experiments reveal that two trimers complex with one dye molecule. Studies with several triphenylmethane dyes reveal that three N, N-dialkylamino substituents are required for complexation. Several mutant trimers, in which Phe19, Phe20, and Ile31 were mutated to cyclohexylalanine, valine, and cyclohexylglycine, were prepared to probe the triphenylmethane dye binding site. Size exclusion chromatography, SDS-PAGE, and X-ray crystallographic studies demonstrate that these mutations do not impact the structure or assembly of the triangular trimer. Fluorescence spectroscopy and analytical ultracentrifugation experiments reveal that the dye packs against an aromatic surface formed by the Phe20 side chains and is clasped by the Ile31 side chains. Docking and molecular modeling provide a working model of the complex in which the triphenylmethane dye is sandwiched between two triangular trimers. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the X-ray crystallographic structures of triangular trimers derived from Abeta can be used to guide the discovery of ligands that bind to soluble oligomers derived from Abeta.

30125779|t|Soluble Abeta1-42 suppresses TNF-alpha and activates NLRP3 inflammasome in THP-1 macrophages.
30125779|a|Deposition of amyloid-beta in Alzheimer's disease is accompanied by chronic inflammation, which involves raised levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1beta. However, the role of Abeta1-42 in the inflammatory process, before it gets deposited into aggregates has not been investigated thoroughly. Through this study, we are illustrating the dual role of soluble Abeta1-42 (sAbeta1-42) in activating the NLRP3 inflammasome and simultaneously inhibiting TNF-alpha secretion. Our data suggested that the treatment of chronically induced THP-1 macrophages and N9 microglial cells with sAbeta1-42 can suppress the major inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha without affecting the level of IL-6. However, the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome was well evidenced by secretion of IL-1beta, increased expression of NLRP3 and caspase-1, implicating sAbeta1-42 in enhancing and suppressing one or other type of inflammation. Further investigation revealed that sAbeta1-42 was able to severely abrogate the expression of NF-kappaB, p50 and restricting the translocation of NF-kappaB, p65 to nucleus by inhibiting phosphorylation of IkappaB-alpha in THP-1 macrophages. These data indicate that the sAbeta1-42 may play a dual role during inflammatory process, wherein, it may be involved in protecting the cells from inflammatory damage due to TNF-alpha. This ability of sAbeta1-42 might be playing some role in protecting the brain cells during the process of aging and Alzheimer's disease, where, chronic inflammatory environment plays a vital role.

30131337|t|A d-enantiomeric peptide interferes with heteroassociation of amyloid-beta oligomers and prion protein.
30131337|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. One AD hallmark is the aggregation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) into soluble oligomers and insoluble fibrils. Several studies have reported that oligomers rather than fibrils are the most toxic species in AD progression. Abeta oligomers bind with high affinity to membrane-associated prion protein (PrP), leading to toxic signaling across the cell membrane, which makes the Abeta-PrP interaction an attractive therapeutic target. Here, probing this interaction in more detail, we found that both full-length, soluble human (hu) PrP(23-230) and huPrP(23-144), lacking the globular C-terminal domain, bind to Abeta oligomers to form large complexes above the megadalton size range. Following purification by sucrose density-gradient ultracentrifugation, the Abeta and huPrP contents in these heteroassemblies were quantified by reversed-phase HPLC. The Abeta:PrP molar ratio in these assemblies exhibited some limited variation depending on the molar ratio of the initial mixture. Specifically, a molar ratio of about four Abeta to one huPrP in the presence of an excess of huPrP(23-230) or huPrP(23-144) suggested that four Abeta units are required to form one huPrP-binding site. Of note, an Abeta-binding all-d-enantiomeric peptide, RD2D3, competed with huPrP for Abeta oligomers and interfered with Abeta-PrP heteroassembly in a concentration-dependent manner. Our results highlight the importance of multivalent epitopes on Abeta oligomers for Abeta-PrP interactions and have yielded an all-d-peptide-based, therapeutically promising agent that competes with PrP for these interactions.

30133282|t|Catalytic Mechanism of Amyloid-beta Peptide Degradation by Insulin Degrading Enzyme: Insights from Quantum Mechanics and Molecular Mechanics Style Moller-Plesset Second Order Perturbation Theory Calculation.
30133282|a|Insulin degrading enzyme (IDE), a metalloprotease that degrades amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides and insulin, is associated with Alzheimer's disease and diabetes. The mechanism of IDE catalyzed degrading of Abeta peptides, which is of fundamental importance in the design of therapeutic methods for Alzheimer's disease, has not been fully understood. In this work, combined quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) style Moller-Plesset second order perturbation theory (MP2) geometry optimization calculations are performed to investigate the catalytic mechanism of the Abeta40 Phe19-Phe20 peptide bond cleavage by human IDE. The analyses using QM/MM MP2 optimization suggest that a neutral water molecule is at the active site of the enzyme-substrate (ES) complex. The water molecule is in hydrogen bonding with the nearby anionic Glu111 of IDE but not directly bound to the catalytic Zn ion. This is confirmed by QM/MM DFTB3 molecular dynamics simulation. Our studies also reveal that the hydrolysis of the Abeta40 Phe19-Phe20 peptide bond by IDE consists of four key steps. The neutral water is first activated by moving toward and binding to the Zn ion. A gem-diol intermediate is then formed by the activated neutral water molecule attacking the C atom of the Phe19-Phe20 peptide bond. The next is the protonation of the N atom of Phe19-Phe20 peptide bond to form an intermediate with an elongated C-N bond. The final step is the breaking of the Phe19-Phe20 C-N bond. The final step is the rate-determining step with a calculated Gibbs free energy of activation of 17.34 kcal/mol, in good agreement with the experimental value 16.7 kcal/mol. This mechanism provides the basis for the design of biochemical methods to modulate the activity of IDE in humans.

30134156|t|Living Neurons with Tau Filaments Aberrantly Expose Phosphatidylserine and Are Phagocytosed by Microglia.
30134156|a|Tau protein forms insoluble filamentous inclusions that are closely associated with nerve cell death in many neurodegenerative diseases. How neurons die in these tauopathies is unclear. We report that living neurons with tau inclusions from P301S-tau mice expose abnormally high amounts of phosphatidylserine because of the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Consequently, co-cultured phagocytes (BV2 cells or primary microglia) identify and phagocytose the living neurons, thereby engulfing insoluble tau inclusions. To facilitate engulfment, neurons induce contacting microglia to secrete the opsonin milk-fat-globule EGF-factor-8 (MFGE8) and nitric oxide (NO), whereas neurons with tau inclusions are rescued when MFGE8 or NO production is prevented. MFGE8 expression is elevated in transgenic P301S-tau mouse brains with tau inclusions and in tau inclusion-rich brain regions of several human tauopathies, indicating shared mechanisms of disease. Preventing phagocytosis of living neurons will preserve them for treatments that inhibit tau aggregation and toxicity.

30134656|t|Self-Assembled Curcumin-Poly(carboxybetaine methacrylate) Conjugates: Potent Nano-Inhibitors against Amyloid beta-Protein Fibrillogenesis and Cytotoxicity.
30134656|a|Fibrillogenesis of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, so inhibition of Abeta aggregation is considered as an important strategy for the precaution and treatment of AD. Curcumin (Cur) has been recognized as an effective inhibitor of Abeta fibrillogenesis, but its potential application is limited by its poor bioavailability. Herein, we proposed to conjugate Cur to a zwitterionic polymer, poly(carboxybetaine methacrylate) (pCB), and synthesized three Cur@pCB conjugates of different degrees of substitution (DS, 1.9-2.9). Cur@pCB conjugates self-assembled into nanogels of 120-190 nm. The inhibition effects of Cur@pCB conjugates on the fibrillation and cytotoxicity of Abeta42 was investigated by extensive biophysical and biological analyses. Thioflavin T fluorescence assays and atomic force microscopic observations revealed that the Cur@pCB conjugates were much more efficient than molecular curcumin on inhibiting Abeta42 fibrillation, and cytotoxicity assays also indicated the same tendency. Of the three conjugates, Cur1@pCB of the lowest DS (1.97) exhibited the best performance; 5 muM Cur1@pCB functioned similarly with 25 muM free curcumin. Moreover, 5 muM Cur1@pCB increased the cell viability by 43% but free curcumin at the same concentration showed little effect. It is considered that the highly hydrated state of the zwitterionic polymers resulted in the superiority of Cur@pCB over free curcumin. Namely, the dense hydration layer on the conjugates strongly stabilized the bound Abeta on curcumin anchored on the polymer, suppressing the conformational transition of the protein to beta-sheet-rich structures. This was demonstrated by circular dichroism spectroscopy, in which Cur1@pCB was proven to be the strongest in the three conjugates. The research has thus revealed a new function of zwitterionic polymer pCBMA and provided new insights into the development of more potent nanoinhibitors for suppressing Abeta fibrillogenesis and cytotoxicity.

30134967|t|Pharmacodynamics of atabecestat (JNJ-54861911), an oral BACE1 inhibitor in patients with early Alzheimer's disease: randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
30134967|a|BACKGROUND: beta-Secretase enzyme (BACE) inhibition has been proposed as a priority treatment mechanism for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but treatment initiation may need to be very early. We present proof of mechanism of atabecestat (also known as JNJ-54861911), an oral BACE inhibitor for the treatment of AD, in Caucasian and Japanese populations with early AD who do not show signs of dementia. METHODS: In two similarly designed phase I studies, a sample of amyloid-positive elderly patients comprising 45 Caucasian patients with early AD diagnosed as preclinical AD (n = 15, Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] = 0) or with mild cognitive impairment due to AD (n = 30, CDR = 0.5) and 18 Japanese patients diagnosed as preclinical AD (CDR-J = 0) were randomized 1:1:1 to atabecestat 10 or 50 mg or placebo (n = 6-8/treatment) daily for 4 weeks. Safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) (i.e., reduction of cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] amyloid beta 1-40 [Abeta1-40] levels [primary endpoint] and effect on other AD biomarkers) of atabecestat were evaluated. RESULTS: In both populations, atabecestat was well tolerated and characterized by linear PK and high central nervous system penetrance of unbound drug. Atabecestat significantly reduced CSF Abeta1-40 levels from baseline at day 28 in both the 10-mg (67-68%) and 50-mg (87-90%) dose groups compared with placebo. For Caucasians with early AD, the least squares mean differences (95% CI) were - 69.37 (- 72.25; - 61.50) and - 92.74 (- 100.08; - 85.39), and for Japanese with preclinical AD, they were - 62.48 (- 78.32; - 46.64) and - 80.81 (- 96.13; - 65.49), respectively. PK/PD model simulations confirmed that once-daily 10 mg and 50 mg atabecestat can attain 60-70% and 90% Abeta1-40 reductions, respectively. The trend of the reduction was similar across the Abeta1-37, Abeta1-38, and Abeta1-42 fragments in both atabecestat dose groups, consistent with Abeta1-40. CSF amyloid precursor protein fragment (sAPPbeta) levels declined from baseline, regardless of patient population, whereas CSF sAPPalpha levels increased compared with placebo. There were no relevant changes in either CSF total tau or phosphorylated tau 181P over a 4-week treatment period. CONCLUSIONS: JNJ-54861911 at 10 and 50 mg daily doses after 4 weeks resulted in mean CSF Abeta1-40 reductions of 67% and up to 90% in both Caucasian and Japanese patients with early stage AD, confirming results in healthy elderly adults.

30135452|t|Bonsai Gelsolin Survives Heat Induced Denaturation by Forming beta-Amyloids which Leach Out Functional Monomer.
30135452|a|Here, we report that minimal functional gelsolin i.e. fragment 28-161 can display F-actin depolymerizing property even after heating the protein to 80  C. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data analysis confirmed that under Ca2+-free conditions, 28-161 associates into monomer to dimer and tetramer, which later forms beta-amyloids, but in presence of Ca2+, it forms dimers which proceed to non-characterizable aggregates. The dimeric association also explained the observed decrease in ellipticity in circular dichroism experiments with increase in temperature. Importantly, SAXS data based models correlated well with our crystal structure of dimeric state of 28-161. Characterization of higher order association by electron microscopy, Congo red and ThioflavinT staining assays further confirmed that only in absence of Ca2+ ions, heating transforms 28-161 into beta-amyloids. Gel filtration and other experiments showed that beta-amyloids keep leaching out the monomer, and the release rates could be enhanced by addition of L-Arg to the amyloids. F-actin depolymerization showed that addition of Ca2+ ions to released monomer initiated the depolymerization activity. Overall, we propose a way to compose a supramolecular assembly which releases functional protein in sustained manner which can be applied for varied potentially therapeutic interventions.

30138767|t|Sleep moderates the relationship between amyloid beta and memory recall.
30138767|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, although Abeta alone may be insufficient to cause impairments. Modifiable health factors, including sleep, may mitigate functional symptoms of neurodegeneration. We assessed whether sleep moderated the relationship between Abeta and cognitive performance in 41 older adults, mean age 83 years. Sleep measures included actigraphy-assessed wake after sleep onset and total sleep time. Cognitive performance was assessed with memory recall, cognitive flexibility, and verbal fluency. Memory recall was assessed with the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure task, cognitive flexibility with the Trail Making test, and verbal fluency with FAS word generation. Abeta was assessed with a global measure of Pittsburgh Compound B. Wake after sleep onset moderated the relationship between Abeta and memory, with a stronger positive association for Abeta and forgetting in those with poorer sleep. These results suggest a possible protective role of sleep in preclinical Alzheimer's disease.

30140051|t|Interplay between innate immunity and Alzheimer disease: APOE and TREM2 in the spotlight.
30140051|a|Alzheimer disease is more than a pure proteopathy. Chronic neuroinflammation stands out during the pathogenesis of the disease and in turn modulates disease progression. The central nervous system (CNS) is separated from the blood circulation by the blood-brain barrier. In Alzheimer disease, neuroinflammation heavily relies on innate immune responses that are primarily mediated by CNS-resident microglia. APOE (which encodes apolipoprotein E) is the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer disease, and APOE was recently shown to affect the disease in part through its immunomodulatory function. This function of APOE is likely linked to triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), which is expressed by microglia in the CNS. Here, we review the rapidly growing literature on the role of disease-associated microglia, TREM2 and APOE in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease and present an integrated view of innate immune function in Alzheimer disease.

30140941|t|Changes in proteome solubility indicate widespread proteostatic disruption in mouse models of neurodegenerative disease.
30140941|a|The deposition of pathologic misfolded proteins in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is hypothesized to burden protein homeostatic (proteostatic) machinery, potentially leading to insufficient capacity to maintain the proteome. This hypothesis has been supported by previous work in our laboratory, as evidenced by the perturbation of cytosolic protein solubility in response to amyloid plaques in a mouse model of Alzheimer's amyloidosis. In the current study, we demonstrate changes in proteome solubility are a common pathology to mouse models of neurodegenerative disease. Pathological accumulations of misfolded tau, alpha-synuclein and mutant superoxide dismutase 1 in CNS tissues of transgenic mice were associated with changes in the solubility of hundreds of CNS proteins in each model. We observed that changes in proteome solubility were progressive and, using the rTg4510 model of inducible tau pathology, demonstrated that these changes were dependent upon sustained expression of the primary pathologic protein. In all of the models examined, changes in proteome solubility were robust, easily detected, and provided a sensitive indicator of proteostatic disruption. Interestingly, a subset of the proteins that display a shift towards insolubility were common between these different models, suggesting that a specific subset of the proteome is vulnerable to proteostatic disruption. Overall, our data suggest that neurodegenerative proteinopathies modeled in mice impose a burden on the proteostatic network that diminishes the ability of neural cells to prevent aberrant conformational changes that alter the solubility of hundreds of abundant cellular proteins.

30143603|t|The genetic risk of Alzheimer's disease beyond APOE epsilon4: systematic review of Alzheimer's genetic risk scores.
30143603|a|The epsilon4 allele of Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the strongest known genetic risk factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD) but does not account for the entirety of genetic risk. Genetic risk scores (GRSs) incorporating additional genetic variants have been developed to determine the genetic risk for AD, yet there is no systematic review assessing the contribution of GRSs for AD beyond the effect of APOE epsilon4. The purpose of this systematic PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses)-based review was to summarize original research studies that have developed and validated a GRS for AD utilizing associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched on April 6, 2018 and screening was completed on 2018 citations by two independent reviewers. Eighteen studies published between 2010 and 2018 were included in the review. All GRSs expressed significant associations or discrimination capability of AD when compared to clinically normal controls; however, GRS prediction of MCI to AD conversion was mixed. APOE epsilon4 status was more predictive of AD than the GRSs, although the GRSs did add to AD prediction accuracy beyond APOE epsilon4. GRSs might contribute to identifying genetic risk of AD beyond APOE. However, additional studies are warranted to assess the performance of GRSs in independent longitudinal cohorts.

30144634|t|Searching for improved mimetic peptides inhibitors preventing conformational transition of amyloid-beta42 monomer.
30144634|a|A series of novel mimetic peptides were designed, synthesised and biologically evaluated as inhibitors of Abeta42 aggregation. One of the synthesised peptidic compounds, termed compound 7 modulated Abeta42 aggregation as demonstrated by thioflavin T fluorescence, acting also as an inhibitor of the cytotoxicity exerted by Abeta42 aggregates. The early stage interaction between compound 7 and the Abeta42 monomer was investigated by replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations and docking studies. Our theoretical results revealed that compound 7 can elongate the helical conformation state of an early stage Abeta42 monomer and it helps preventing the formation of beta-sheet structures by interacting with key residues in the central hydrophobic cluster (CHC). This strategy where early "on-pathway" events are monitored by small molecules will help the development of new therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease.

30149454|t|Clinical Experience with Cerebrospinal Fluid Abeta42, Total and Phosphorylated Tau in the Evaluation of 1,016 Individuals for Suspected Dementia.
30149454|a|BACKGROUND: Elevated total tau (tTau), 181-phosphorylated phosphorylated tau (pTau), and low amyloid-beta42 (Abeta42) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) represent a diagnostic biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: The goal was to determine the overall accuracy of CSF Abeta42, tTau, pTau, and the Abeta42/total tau index (ATI) in a non-research, clinical setting for the diagnosis of AD. METHODS: From medical records in 1,016 patients that had CSF studies for dementia over a 12-year period (2005 to 2017), we calculated the sensitivity and specificity of CSF Abeta42, tTau, and pTau and the ATI in relation to the final clinical diagnosis. RESULTS: Compared with non-demented patients and patients with other dementias or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the sensitivity and specificity of the recommended ATI and pTau cut-offs (ATI < 1.0 and pTau >61 pg/ml) for the diagnosis of AD were 0.88 and 0.72, respectively. Similar results were obtained comparing AD with non-demented patients only (0.88, 0.82) and AD with other types of dementia (0.81, 0.77). A subgroup of patients with presumed normal pressure hydrocephalus (n = 154) were biopsied at the time of shunt placement. Using the pathological manifestations of AD as the standard, the sensitivity was 0.83 while the specificity was 0.72. CONCLUSIONS: In a non-research setting, CSF biomarkers for AD showed a high sensitivity in accordance with previous studies, but modest specificity differentiating AD from other types of dementia or MCI. This study of unselected patients provides a valid and realistic assessment of the diagnostic accuracy of these CSF biomarkers in clinical practice.

30149759|t|Scutellarin Ameliorates Learning and Memory Deficit via Suppressing beta-Amyloid Formation and Microglial Activation in Rats with Chronic Cerebral Hypoperfusion.
30149759|a|Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion is considered as a pivotal factor of cognitive impairment that occurs in cerebrovascular diseases. This study investigated the ameliorating effect of scutellarin (SCT) on spatial cognitive impairment and beta-amyloid (Abeta) formation in rats with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion induced by permanent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (pBCAO). SCT is a flavonoid in medicinal herb of Erigeron breviscapus (vant.) Hand. Mazz. known to have neuroprotective, antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. However, the beneficial effect and pivotal mechanism of SCT on cognitive impairment are still unclear. SCT was treated orally with two doses (10 or 30 mg/kg) for 4 weeks. Results of Morris water maze test performed on the ninth week after pBCAO revealed that SCT (30 mg/kg)-treated rats had significantly shortened escape latencies in acquisition training trials, significantly prolonged swimming time at the platform and its surrounding zone, significant increase in memory score, significant reduction in the number of target heading, and significant reduction in the time required for the first target heading during the retention trial compared to rats in the sham-control group. SCT significantly inhibited the production of Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) in brain tissues. However, SCT significantly upregulated the expression levels of amyloid precursor protein and beta-site APP-converting enzyme-1 in the hippocampus. In addition, SCT significantly inhibited the activation of Iba1-expressing microglia in brain tissues. The results suggest that SCT can exert ameliorating effect on spatial cognitive impairment caused by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion through suppressing Abeta formation and microglial activation in brain tissues. Therefore, SCT can be used as a beneficial drug for vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying alpha-synuclein aggregation are not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate in cell culture, nematode, and rodent models of PD that leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), a PD-linked kinase, modulates alpha-synuclein propagation in a kinase activity-dependent manner. The PD-linked G2019S mutation in LRRK2, which increases kinase activity, enhances propagation efficiency. Furthermore, we show that the role of LRRK2 in alpha-synuclein propagation is mediated by RAB35 phosphorylation. Constitutive activation of RAB35 overrides the reduced alpha-synuclein propagation phenotype in lrk-1 mutant C. elegans. Finally, in a mouse model of synucleinopathy, administration of an LRRK2 kinase inhibitor reduced alpha-synuclein aggregation via enhanced interaction of alpha-synuclein with the lysosomal degradation pathway. These results suggest that LRRK2-mediated RAB35 phosphorylation is a potential therapeutic target for modifying disease progression.

30152135|t|Alterations in brain TREM2 and Amyloid-beta levels are associated with neurocognitive impairment in HIV-infected persons on antiretroviral therapy.
30152135|a|Neuroinflammation is a common pathological correlate of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) in individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) regulates neuroinflammation, clears extracellular Amyloid (A)-beta, surveys for damaged neurons, and orchestrates microglial differentiation. TREM2 has not been studied in HIV+ brain tissues. In this retrospective study, we investigated TREM2 expression levels and localization to microglia, Abeta protein levels, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha transcript levels in the frontal cortices of 52 HIV+ decedents. All donors had been on ART; 14 were cognitively normal (CN), 17 had an asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI), and 21 had a minor neurocognitive disorder (MND). Total TREM2 protein levels were increased in the soluble and decreased in the membrane-enriched fractions of MND brain tissues compared to CN; however, brains from MND Hispanics showed the most robust alterations in TREM2 as well as significantly increased TNF-alpha mRNA and Abeta levels when compared to CN Hispanics. Significant alterations in the expression of total TREM2 protein and transcripts for TNF-alpha were not observed in non-Hispanics, despite higher levels of Abeta in the non-Hispanic CN group compared to the non-Hispanic MND groups. These findings show that decreased and increased TREM2 in membrane-bound fractions and in soluble-enriched fractions, respectively, is associated with increased Abeta and neuroinflammation in this cohort of HIV+ brains, particularly those identifying as Hispanics. These findings suggest a role for TREM2 in the brain of HIV+ individuals may deserve more investigation as a biomarker for HAND and as a possible therapeutic target.

30153858|t|Inter-network connectivity and amyloid-beta linked to cognitive decline in preclinical Alzheimer's disease: a longitudinal cohort study.
30153858|a|BACKGROUND: Amyloid-beta (Abeta) has a dose-response relationship with cognition in healthy adults. Additionally, the levels of functional connectivity within and between brain networks have been associated with cognitive performance in healthy adults. Aiming to explore potential synergistic effects, we investigated the relationship of inter-network functional connectivity, Abeta burden, and memory decline among healthy individuals and individuals with preclinical, prodromal, or clinical Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: In this longitudinal cohort study (ADNI2), participants (55-88 years) were followed for a maximum of 5 years. We included cognitively healthy participants and patients with mild cognitive impairment (with or without elevated Abeta) or Alzheimer's disease. Associations between memory decline, Abeta burden, and connectivity between networks across the groups were investigated using linear and curvilinear mixed-effects models. RESULTS: We found a synergistic relationships between inter-network functional connectivity and Abeta burden on memory decline. Dose-response relationships between Abeta and memory decline varied as a function of directionality of inter-network connectivity across groups. When inter-network correlations were negative, the curvilinear mixed-effects models revealed that higher Abeta burden was associated with greater memory decline in cognitively normal participants, but when inter-network correlations were positive, there was no association between the magnitude of Abeta burden and memory decline. Opposite patterns were observed in patients with mild cognitive impairment. Combining negative inter-network correlations with Abeta burden can reduce the required sample size by 88% for clinical trials aiming to slow down memory decline. CONCLUSIONS: The direction of inter-network connectivity provides additional information about Abeta burden on the rate of expected memory decline, especially in the preclinical phase. These results may be valuable for optimizing patient selection and decreasing study times to assess efficacy in clinical trials.

30153862|t|Genome-wide association study for variants that modulate relationships between cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta 42, tau, and p-tau levels.
30153862|a|BACKGROUND: A relationship quantitative trait locus exists when the correlation between multiple traits varies by genotype for that locus. Relationship quantitative trait loci (rQTL) are often involved in gene-by-gene (GxG) interactions or gene-by-environmental interactions, making them a powerful tool for detecting GxG. METHODS: We performed genome-wide association studies to identify rQTL between tau and Abeta42 and ptau and Abeta42 with over 3000 individuals using age, gender, series, APOE epsilon2, APOE epsilon4, and two principal components for population structure as covariates. Each significant rQTL was separately screened for interactions with other loci for each trait in the rQTL model. Parametric bootstrapping was used to assess significance. RESULTS: We found four significant tau/Abeta42 rQTL from three unique locations and six ptau/Abeta42 rQTL from five unique locations. GxG screens with these rQTL produced four significant GxG interactions (one Abeta42, two ptau, and one tau) with four rQTL where each second locus was from a unique location. On follow-up, rs1036819 and rs74025622 were associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) case/control status; rs15205 and rs79099429 were associated with rate of decline. CONCLUSIONS: The two most significant rQTL (rs8027714 and rs1036819) for ptau/Abeta42 are on different chromosomes and both are strong hits for pelvic organ prolapse. While diseases of the nervous system can cause pelvic organ prolapse, it is unlikely related to the ptau/Abeta42 relationship but may suggest that these two loci share a pathway. In addition to a ptau/Abeta42 rQTL and association with AD case/control status, rs1036819 is a strong rQTL for case/control status/Abeta42 and for tau/Abeta42. It resides in the ZFAT gene, which is related to autoimmune thyroid disease. For tau, rs9817620 interacts with the tau/Abeta42 rQTL rs74025622. It is in the CHL1 gene, which is a neural cell adhesion molecule and may be involved in signal transduction pathways. CHL1 is related to BACE1, which is a beta-secretase enzyme that initiates production of the beta-amyloid peptide involved in AD and is a primary drug target. Overall, there are numerous loci that affect the relationship between these important AD endophenotypes and some are due to interactions with other loci. Some affect the risk of AD and/or rate of progression.

30156225|t|Preparation of fibril nuclei of beta-amyloid peptides in reverse micelles.
30156225|a|We report the preparation of protofibrils from oligomeric Abeta40 aggregates, which have been incubated under spatially constrained conditions. The molecular structure of the resultant protofibrils is highly homogeneous, suggesting that the phenomenon of structural polymorphism commonly observed in Abeta40 fibrils may be largely due to multiple nucleation events.

30158114|t|TLR5 decoy receptor as a novel anti-amyloid therapeutic for Alzheimer's disease.
30158114|a|There is considerable interest in harnessing innate immunity to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we explore whether a decoy receptor strategy using the ectodomain of select TLRs has therapeutic potential in AD. AAV-mediated expression of human TLR5 ectodomain (sTLR5) alone or fused to human IgG4 Fc (sTLR5Fc) results in robust attenuation of amyloid beta (Abeta) accumulation in a mouse model of Alzheimer-type Abeta pathology. sTLR5Fc binds to oligomeric and fibrillar Abeta with high affinity, forms complexes with Abeta, and blocks Abeta toxicity. Oligomeric and fibrillar Abeta modulates flagellin-mediated activation of human TLR5 but does not, by itself, activate TLR5 signaling. Genetic analysis shows that rare protein coding variants in human TLR5 may be associated with a reduced risk of AD. Further, transcriptome analysis shows altered TLR gene expression in human AD. Collectively, our data suggest that TLR5 decoy receptor-based biologics represent a novel and safe Abeta-selective class of biotherapy in AD.

30167602|t|A chemically engineered, stable oligomer mimic of amyloid beta42 containing an oxime switch for fibril formation.
30167602|a|Toxic aggregation of monomeric amyloid beta (Abeta) into oligomers followed by the formation of fibrils is a causative process in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The mechanism for furnishing the toxicity of Abeta aggregates is elusive, however, mainly due to the transient, unstable properties of the oligomer states. Oligomer mimics stabilized by chemical protein engineering are potentially useful tools for elucidating the pathogenicity of Abeta aggregates. Here we report a stable Abeta oligomer mimic that is transformed into fibrils by a chemical stimulus, i.e., an oxime exchange reaction. A derivative of Abeta42[Met35(O)], compound 2, containing an oxime tether between residues 23 and 28 (a salt-bridge surrogate between Asp23 and Lys28 of the Abeta42 oligomer), rapidly and homogeneously formed stable, relatively large oligomers with preserved amyloid-like properties, such as the propensity to form beta-sheets and toxicity. Chemical cleavage of the tether via an oxime exchange reaction induced transformation of the oligomers into the fibril state. These results demonstrate that the oxime bond formation/cleavage can switch the aggregation state of the mimic by functionally surrogating the salt-bridge of Abeta42. This novel system temporally dissects the dynamic process of Abeta aggregation, and thus might offer a unique molecular tool for exploring the properties of Abeta oligomers and fibrils.

30169035|t|Structural Insight into Redox Dynamics of Copper Bound N-Truncated Amyloid-beta Peptides from in Situ X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy.
30169035|a|X-ray absorption spectroscopy of CuII amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) under in situ electrochemical control (XAS-EC) has allowed elucidation of the redox properties of CuII bound to truncated peptide forms. The Cu binding environment is significantly different for the Abeta1-16 and the N-truncated Abeta4-9, Abeta4-12, and Abeta4-16 (Abeta4-9/12/16) peptides, where the N-truncated sequence (F4R5H6) provides the high-affinity amino-terminal copper nickel (ATCUN) binding motif. Low temperature (ca. 10 K) XAS measurements show the adoption of identical CuII ATCUN-type binding sites (CuIIATCUN) by the first three amino acids (FRH) and a longer-range interaction modeled as an oxygen donor ligand, most likely water, to give a tetragonal pyramid geometry in the Abeta4-9/12/16 peptides not previously reported. Both XAS-EC and EPR measurements show that CuII:Abeta4-16 can be reduced at mildly reducing potentials, similar to that of CuII:Abeta1-16. Reduction of peptides lacking the H13H14 residues, CuII:Abeta4-9/12, require far more forcing conditions, with metallic copper the only metal-based reduction product. The observations suggest that reduction of CuIIATCUN species at mild potentials is possible, although the rate of reduction is significantly enhanced by involvement of H13H14. XAS-EC analysis reveals that, following reduction, the peptide acts as a terdentate ligand to CuI (H13, H14 together with the linking amide oxygen atom). Modeling of the EXAFS is most consistent with coordination of an additional water oxygen atom to give a quasi-tetrahedral geometry. XAS-EC analysis of oxidized CuII:Abeta4-12/16 gives structural parameters consistent with crystallographic data for a five-coordinate CuIII complex and the CuIIATCUN complex. The structural results suggest that CuII and the oxidation product are both accommodated in an ATCUN-like binding site.

30170005|t|Nanodisc-Forming Scaffold Protein Promoted Retardation of Amyloid-Beta Aggregation.
30170005|a|Peptidic nanodiscs are useful membrane mimetic tools for structural and functional studies of membrane proteins, and membrane interacting peptides including amyloids. Here, we demonstrate anti-amyloidogenic activities of a nanodisc-forming 18-residue peptide (denoted as 4F), both in lipid-bound and lipid-free states by using Alzheimer's amyloid-beta (Abeta40) peptide as an example. Fluorescence-based amyloid fibrillation kinetic assays showed a significant delay in Abeta40 amyloid aggregation by the 4F peptide. In addition, 4F-encased lipid nanodiscs, at an optimal concentration of 4F (>20 muM) and nanodisc size (<10 nm), significantly affect amyloid fibrillation. A comparison of experimental results obtained from nanodiscs with that obtained from liposomes revealed a substantial inhibitory efficacy of 4F-lipid nanodiscs against Abeta40 aggregation and were also found to be suitable to trap Abeta40 intermediates. A combination of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations with NMR and circular dichroism experimental results exhibited a substantial change in Abeta40 conformation upon 4F binding through electrostatic and pi-pi interactions. Specifically, the 4F peptide was found to interfere with the central beta-sheet-forming residues of Abeta40 through substantial hydrogen, pi-pi, and pi-alkyl interactions. Fluorescence experiments and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations showed the formation of a ternary complex, where Abeta40 binds to the proximity of peptidic belt and membrane surface that deaccelerate amyloid fibrillation. Electron microscopy images revealed short and thick amyloid fibers of Abeta40 formed in the presence of 4F or 4F-lipid nanodsics. These findings could aid in the development of amyloid inhibitors as well as in stabilizing Abeta40 intermediates for high-resolution structural and neurobiological studies.

30170611|t|Anti-TLR2 antibody triggers oxidative phosphorylation in microglia and increases phagocytosis of beta-amyloid.
30170611|a|BACKGROUND: Microglia are multifunctional cells that are primarily neuroprotective and a deficit in their functional integrity is likely to be a contributory factor in the deteriorating neuronal function that occurs with age and neurodegeneration. One aspect of microglial dysfunction is reduced phagocytosis, and this is believed to contribute to the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, improving phagocytosis should be beneficial in limiting the amyloidosis that characterises AD. METHODS: Here, we investigated whether an antibody that targets toll-like receptor (TLR)2 might attenuate the inflammatory and metabolic changes induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and amyloid-beta. The impact on phagocytosis was assessed by immunohistochemistry. We evaluated the metabolic changes with the SeaHorse Extracellular Flux Analyser and studied the expression of key enzymes driving glycolysis by western blotting. For all experiments, statistical significance was determined by unpaired Student's t test and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: We have reported that, when exposed to an inflammatory stimulus, microglia switch their metabolism towards the metabolically- inefficient glycolysis; this potentially impacts on metabolically demanding functions like phagocytosis. Anti-TLR2 antibody increased phagocytosis of Abeta in LPS + Abeta-stimulated microglia and this was linked with the ability of the antibody to attenuate the LPS + Abeta-triggered inflammasome activation. LPS + Abeta increased glycolysis in microglia and increased the expression of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase (PFKFB)3, an enzyme that plays a key role in driving glycolysis; these effects were inhibited when cells were incubated with the anti-TLR2 antibody. The data also show that antibody treatment increased oxidative metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, microglia with an inflammatory phenotype, specifically cells in which the inflammasome is activated, are glycolytic; this may compromise the metabolic efficiency of microglia and thereby provide an explanation for the reduced phagocytic function of the cells. We propose that, by restoring oxidative metabolism and reducing inflammasome activation in microglia, phagocytic function is also restored.

30172024|t|Amyloid precursor protein is required for in vitro platelet adhesion to amyloid peptides and potentiation of thrombus formation.
30172024|a|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is the precursor of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides, whose accumulation in the brain is associated with Alzheimer's disease. APP is also expressed on the platelet surface and Abeta peptides are platelet agonists. The physiological role of APP is largely unknown. In neurons, APP acts as an adhesive receptor, facilitating integrin-mediated cell adhesion, while in platelets it regulates coagulation and venous thrombosis. In this work, we analyzed platelets from APP KO mice to investigate whether membrane APP supports platelet adhesion to physiological and pathological substrates. We found that APP-null platelets adhered and spread normally on collagen, von Willebrand Factor or fibrinogen. However, adhesion on immobilized Abeta peptides Abeta1-40, Abeta1-42 and Abeta25-35 was completely abolished in platelets lacking APP. By contrast, platelet activation and aggregation induced by Abeta peptides occurred normally in the absence of APP. Adhesion of APP-transfected HEK293 to Abeta peptides was significantly higher than that of control cells expressing low levels of APP. Co-coating of Abeta1-42 and Abeta25-35 with collagen strongly potentiated platelet adhesion when whole blood from wild type mice was perfused at arterial shear rate, but had no effects with blood from APP KO mice. These results demonstrate that APP selectively mediates platelet adhesion to Abeta under static condition but not platelet aggregation, and is responsible for Abeta-promoted potentiation of thrombus formation under flow. Therefore, APP may facilitate an early step in thrombus formation when Abeta peptides accumulate in cerebral vessel walls or atherosclerotic plaques.

30172624|t|Plasma and CSF biomarkers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in adults with Down syndrome: a cross-sectional study.
30172624|a|BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in Down syndrome is challenging because of the absence of validated diagnostic biomarkers. We investigated the diagnostic performance of plasma and CSF biomarkers in this population. METHODS: We did a cross-sectional study of adults aged 18 years and older with Down syndrome enrolled in a population-based health plan in Catalonia, Spain. Every person with Down syndrome assessed in the health plan was eligible to enter the Down Alzheimer Barcelona Neuroimaging Initiative, and those with a plasma or CSF sample available were included in this study. Participants underwent neurological and neuropsychological examination and blood sampling, and a subset underwent a lumbar puncture. Adults with Down syndrome were classified into asymptomatic, prodromal Alzheimer's disease, or Alzheimer's disease dementia groups by investigators masked to biomarker data. Non-trisomic controls were a convenience sample of young (23-58 years) healthy people from the Sant Pau Initiative on Neurodegeneration. Amyloid-beta (Abeta)1-40, Abeta1-42, total tau (t-tau), 181-phosphorylated tau (p-tau; only in CSF), and neurofilament light protein (NfL) concentrations were measured in plasma with a single molecule array assay and in CSF with ELISA. Plasma and CSF biomarker concentrations were compared between controls and the Down syndrome clinical groups. Diagnostic performance was assessed with receiver operating characteristic curve analyses between asymptomatic participants and those with prodromal Alzheimer's disease and between asymptomatic participants and those with Alzheimer's disease dementia. FINDINGS: Between Feb 1, 2013, and Nov 30, 2017, we collected plasma from 282 participants with Down syndrome (194 asymptomatic, 39 prodromal Alzheimer's disease, 49 Alzheimer's disease dementia) and 67 controls; CSF data were available from 94 participants (54, 18, and 22, respectively) and all 67 controls. The diagnostic performance of plasma biomarkers was poor (area under the curve [AUC] between 0 53 [95% CI 0 44-0 62] and 0 74 [0 66-0 82]) except for plasma NfL concentrations, which had an AUC of 0 88 (0 82-0 93) for the differentiation of the asymptomatic group versus the prodromal Alzheimer's disease group and 0 95 (0 92-0 98) for the asymptomatic group versus the Alzheimer's disease dementia group. In CSF, except for Abeta1-40 concentrations (AUC 0 60, 95% CI 0 45-0 75), all biomarkers had a good performance in the asymptomatic versus prodromal Alzheimer's disease comparison: AUC 0 92 (95% CI 0 85-0 99) for Abeta1-42, 0 81 (0 69-0 94) for t-tau, 0 80 (0 67-0 93) for p-tau, and 0 88 (0 79-0 96) for NfL. Performance of the CSF biomarkers was optimal in the asymptomatic versus Alzheimer's disease dementia comparison (AUC >=0 90 for all except Abeta1-40 [0 59, 0 45-0 72]). Only NfL concentrations showed a strong correlation between plasma and CSF biomarker concentrations in participants with Down syndrome (rho=0 80; p<0 0001). INTERPRETATION: Plasma NfL and CSF biomarkers have good diagnostic performance to detect Alzheimer's disease in adults with Down syndrome. Our findings support the utility of plasma NfL for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease in Down syndrome in clinical practice and clinical trials.

30176342|t|The amyloid precursor protein binds to beta-catenin and modulates its cellular distribution.
30176342|a|Accumulating evidence has shown that the processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the formation of amyloid-beta are associated with the canonical Wnt/ beta-catenin signalling pathway. It was recently published that the drosophila homologue of APP is a conserved modulator of Wnt PCP signalling, suggesting a potential regulation of this pathway by APP. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential interaction of APP with the canonical Wnt pathway. APP overexpression in N2a cells led to alterations in the subcellular distribution of beta-catenin by physically binding to it, preventing its translocation to the nucleus and precluding the transcription of Wnt target genes. In addition, studies in APP transgenic mice and human Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain tissue showed the cellular co-localization of APP and beta-catenin and binding of both proteins, suggesting the formation physical complexes of APP and beta-catenin, yet not present in healthy controls. Furthermore, a reduction in the levels of nuclear beta-catenin was detected in AD brains compared to controls as well as a decrease in the expression of the inactive phosphorylated Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) isoform. Therefore, these findings indicate a reciprocal regulation of Wnt/ beta-catenin signalling pathway and APP processing involving a physical interaction between APP and beta-catenin.

30180184|t|Seasonal plasticity of cognition and related biological measures in adults with and without Alzheimer disease: Analysis of multiple cohorts.
30180184|a|BACKGROUND: There are few data concerning the association between season and cognition and its neurobiological correlates in older persons-effects with important translational and therapeutic implications for the diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer disease (AD). We aimed to measure these effects. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We analyzed data from 3,353 participants from 3 observational community-based cohort studies of older persons (the Rush Memory and Aging Project [MAP], the Religious Orders Study [ROS], and the Minority Aging Research Study [MARS]) and 2 observational memory-clinic-based cohort studies (Centre de Neurologie Cognitive [CNC] study at Lariboisiere Hospital and the Sunnybrook Dementia Study [SDS]). We performed neuropsychological testing and, in subsets of participants, evaluated cerebrospinal fluid AD biomarkers, standardized structured autopsy measures, and/or prefrontal cortex gene expression by RNA sequencing. We examined the association between season and these variables using nested multiple linear and logistic regression models. There was a robust association between season and cognition that was replicated in multiple cohorts (amplitude = 0.14 SD [a measure of the magnitude of seasonal variation relative to overall variability; 95% CI 0.07-0.23], p = 0.007, in the combined MAP, ROS, and MARS cohorts; amplitude = 0.50 SD [95% CI 0.07-0.66], p = 0.017, in the SDS cohort). Average composite global cognitive function was higher in the summer and fall compared to winter and spring, with the difference equivalent in cognitive effect to 4.8 years' difference in age (95% CI 2.1-8.4, p = 0.002). Further, the odds of meeting criteria for mild cognitive impairment or dementia were higher in the winter and spring (odds ratio 1.31 [95% CI 1.10-1.57], p = 0.003). These results were robust against multiple potential confounders including depressive symptoms, sleep, physical activity, and thyroid status and persisted in cases with AD pathology. Moreover, season had a marked effect on cerebrospinal fluid Abeta 42 level (amplitude 0.30 SD [95% CI 0.10-0.64], p = 0.003), which peaked in the summer, and on the brain expression of 4 cognition-associated modules of co-expressed genes (m6: amplitude = 0.44 SD [95% CI 0.21-0.65], p = 0.0021; m13: amplitude = 0.46 SD [95% CI 0.27-0.76], p = 0.0009; m109: amplitude = 0.43 SD [95% CI 0.24-0.67], p = 0.0021; and m122: amplitude 0.46 SD [95% CI 0.20-0.71], p = 0.0012), which were in phase or anti-phase to the rhythms of cognition and which were in turn associated with binding sites for several seasonally rhythmic transcription factors including BCL11A, CTCF, EGR1, MEF2C, and THAP1. Limitations include the evaluation of each participant or sample once per annual cycle, reliance on self-report for measurement of environmental and behavioral factors, and potentially limited generalizability to individuals in equatorial regions or in the southern hemisphere. CONCLUSIONS: Season has a clinically significant association with cognition and its neurobiological correlates in older adults with and without AD pathology. There may be value in increasing dementia-related clinical resources in the winter and early spring, when symptoms are likely to be most pronounced. Moreover, the persistence of robust seasonal plasticity in cognition and its neurobiological correlates, even in the context of concomitant AD pathology, suggests that targeting environmental or behavioral drivers of seasonal cognitive plasticity, or the key transcription factors and genes identified in this study as potentially mediating these effects, may allow us to substantially improve cognition in adults with and without AD.

30181558|t|Structural basis for the complete resistance of the human prion protein mutant G127V to prion disease.
30181558|a|Prion diseases are caused by the propagation of misfolded cellular prion proteins (PrPs). A completely prion disease-resistant genotype, V127M129, has been identified in Papua New Guinea and verified in transgenic mice. To disclose the structural basis of the disease-resistant effect of the G127V mutant, we determined and compared the structural and dynamic features of the G127V-mutated human PrP (residues 91-231) and the wild-type PrP in solution. HuPrP(G127V) contains alpha1, alpha2 and alpha3 helices and a stretch-strand (SS) pattern comprising residues Tyr128-Gly131 (SS1) and Val161-Arg164 (SS2), with extending atomic distances between the SS1 and SS2 strands, and a structural rearrangement of the Tyr128 side chain due to steric hindrance of the larger hydrophobic side chain of Val127. The extended alpha1 helix gets closer to the alpha2 and alpha3 helices. NMR dynamics analysis revealed that Tyr128, Gly131 and Tyr163 underwent significant conformational exchanges. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that HuPrP(G127V) prevents the formation of stable beta-sheets and dimers. Unique structural and dynamic features potentially inhibit the conformational conversion of the G127V mutant. This work is beneficial for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the complete resistance of the G127V mutant to prion disease and for developing new therapeutics for prion disease.

30185230|t|The Trem2 R47H Alzheimer's risk variant impairs splicing and reduces Trem2 mRNA and protein in mice but not in humans.
30185230|a|BACKGROUND: The R47H variant of the Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) significantly increases the risk for late onset Alzheimer's disease. Mouse models accurately reproducing phenotypes observed in Alzheimer' disease patients carrying the R47H coding variant are required to understand the TREM2 related dysfunctions responsible for the enhanced risk for late onset Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: A CRISPR/Cas9-assisted gene targeting strategy was used to generate Trem2 R47H knock-in mice. Trem2 mRNA and protein levels as well as Trem2 splicing patterns were assessed in these mice, in iPSC-derived human microglia-like cells, and in human brains from Alzheimer's patients carrying the TREM2 R47H risk factor. RESULTS: Two independent Trem2 R47H knock-in mouse models show reduced Trem2 mRNA and protein production. In both mouse models Trem2 haploinsufficiency was due to atypical splicing of mouse Trem2 R47H, which introduced a premature stop codon. Cellular splicing assays using minigene constructs demonstrate that the R47H variant induced abnormal splicing only occurs in mice but not in humans. TREM2 mRNA levels and splicing patterns were both normal in iPSC-derived human microglia-like cells and patient brains with the TREM2 R47H variant. CONCLUSIONS: The Trem2 R47H variant activates a cryptic splice site that generates miss-spliced transcripts leading to Trem2 haploinsufficiency only in mice but not in humans. Since Trem2 R47H related phenotypes are mouse specific and do not occur in humans, humanized TREM2 R47H knock-in mice should be generated to study the cellular consequences caused by the human TREM2 R47H coding variant. Currently described phenotypes of Trem2 R47H knock-in mice can therefore not be translated to humans.

30186764|t|Data driven diagnostic classification in Alzheimer's disease based on different reference regions for normalization of PiB-PET images and correlation with CSF concentrations of Abeta species.
30186764|a|Positron emission tomography (PET) neuroimaging with the Pittsburgh Compound_B (PiB) is widely used to assess amyloid plaque burden. Standard quantification approaches normalize PiB-PET by mean cerebellar gray matter uptake. Previous studies suggested similar pons and white-matter uptake in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy controls (HC), but lack exhaustive comparison of normalization across the three regions, with data-driven diagnostic classification. We aimed to compare the impact of distinct reference regions in normalization, measured by data-driven statistical analysis, and correlation with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid beta (Abeta) species concentrations. 243 individuals with clinical diagnosis of AD, HC, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and other dementias, from the Biomarkers for Alzheimer's/Parkinson's Disease (BIOMARKAPD) initiative were included. PiB-PET images and CSF concentrations of Abeta38, Abeta40 and Abeta42 were submitted to classification using support vector machines. Voxel-wise group differences and correlations between normalized PiB-PET images and CSF Abeta concentrations were calculated. Normalization by cerebellar gray matter and pons yielded identical classification accuracy of AD (accuracy-96%, sensitivity-96%, specificity-95%), and significantly higher than Abeta concentrations (best accuracy 91%). Normalization by the white-matter showed decreased extent of statistically significant multivoxel patterns and was the only method not outperforming CSF biomarkers, suggesting statistical inferiority. Abeta38 and Abeta40 correlated negatively with PiB-PET images normalized by the white-matter, corroborating previous observations of correlations with non-AD-specific subcortical changes in white-matter. In general, when using the pons as reference region, higher voxel-wise group differences and stronger correlation with Abeta42, the Abeta42/Abeta40 or Abeta42/Abeta38 ratios were found compared to normalization based on cerebellar gray matter.

30189209|t|Tau Protein Disrupts Nucleocytoplasmic Transport in Alzheimer's Disease.
30189209|a|Tau is the major constituent of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the mechanism underlying tau-associated neural damage remains unclear. Here, we show that tau can directly interact with nucleoporins of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and affect their structural and functional integrity. Pathological tau impairs nuclear import and export in tau-overexpressing transgenic mice and in human AD brain tissue. Furthermore, the nucleoporin Nup98 accumulates in the cell bodies of some tangle-bearing neurons and can facilitate tau aggregation in vitro. These data support the hypothesis that tau can directly interact with NPC components, leading to their mislocalization and consequent disruption of NPC function. This raises the possibility that NPC dysfunction contributes to tau-induced neurotoxicity in AD and tauopathies.

30189724|t|Fluorescent Imaging of beta-Amyloid Using BODIPY Based Near-Infrared Off-On Fluorescent Probe.
30189724|a|Fluorescent imaging of beta-amyloid (Abeta) is one of the most promising methods for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. Several fluorescent probes have been reported to detect Abeta both in vitro and in vivo. However, highly sensitive and highly selective probes with low background signals are still greatly needed. Herein, we rationally designed and synthesized a PIET quenched near-infrared probe QAD-1 to detect Abeta. This probe contains BODIPY as fluorophore and tetrahydroquinoxaline as the quenching group. QAD-1 exhibited significant fluorescent switch-on after binding to soluble and insoluble Abeta species, and the probe had the benefit of low background signal to stain Abeta plaques without the need of wash-out procedures in vitro, which was specially found by the fluorescence off-on probe. QAD-1 could identify the overproduced Abeta in transgenic (APPSWE/PSEN 1dE9) AD mice as early as 6 months old in vivo, which indicated that QAD-1 may be a potential probe for monitoring Abeta species at an early stage of AD.

30189875|t|Human Alzheimer's disease gene expression signatures and immune profile in APP mouse models: a discrete transcriptomic view of Abeta plaque pathology.
30189875|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease with pathological hallmarks including the formation of extracellular aggregates of amyloid-beta (Abeta) known as plaques and intracellular tau tangles. Coincident with the formation of Abeta plaques is recruitment and activation of glial cells to the plaque forming a plaque niche. In addition to histological data showing the formation of the niche, AD genetic studies have added to the growing appreciation of how dysfunctional glia pathways drive neuropathology, with emphasis on microglia pathways. Genomic approaches enable comparisons of human disease profiles between different mouse models informing on their utility to evaluate secondary changes to triggers such as Abeta deposition. METHODS: In this study, we utilized two animal models of AD to examine and characterize the AD-associated pathology: the Tg2576 Swedish APP (KM670/671NL) and TgCRND8 Swedish plus Indiana APP (KM670/671NL + V717F) lines. We used laser capture microscopy (LCM) to isolate samples surrounding Thio-S positive plaques from distal non-plaque tissue. These samples were then analyzed using RNA sequencing. RESULTS: We determined age-associated transcriptomic differences between two similar yet distinct APP transgenic mouse models, known to differ in proportional amyloidogenic species and plaque deposition rates. In Tg2576, human AD gene signatures were not observed despite profiling mice out to 15 months of age. TgCRND8 mice however showed progressive and robust induction of lysomal, neuroimmune, and ITIM/ITAM-associated gene signatures overlapping with prior human AD brain transcriptomic studies. Notably, RNAseq analyses highlighted the vast majority of transcriptional changes observed in aging TgCRND8 cortical brain homogenates were in fact specifically enriched within the plaque niche samples. Data uncovered plaque-associated enrichment of microglia-related genes such as ITIM/ITAM-associated genes and pathway markers of phagocytosis. CONCLUSION: This work may help guide improved translational value of APP mouse models of AD, particularly for strategies aimed at targeting neuroimmune and neurodegenerative pathways, by demonstrating that TgCRND8 more closely recapitulates specific human AD-associated transcriptional responses.

30190379|t|Combined adult neurogenesis and BDNF mimic exercise effects on cognition in an Alzheimer's mouse model.
30190379|a|Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) is impaired before the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. We found that exercise provided cognitive benefit to 5xFAD mice, a mouse model of AD, by inducing AHN and elevating levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Neither stimulation of AHN alone, nor exercise, in the absence of increased AHN, ameliorated cognition. We successfully mimicked the beneficial effects of exercise on AD mice by genetically and pharmacologically inducing AHN in combination with elevating BDNF levels. Suppressing AHN later led to worsened cognitive performance and loss of preexisting dentate neurons. Thus, pharmacological mimetics of exercise, enhancing AHN and elevating BDNF levels, may improve cognition in AD. Furthermore, applied at early stages of AD, these mimetics may protect against subsequent neuronal cell death.

30192126|t|Ultrasound-Excited Protoporphyrin IX-Modified Multifunctional Nanoparticles as a Strong Inhibitor of Tau Phosphorylation and beta-Amyloid Aggregation.
30192126|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become one of the most serious societal problems globally, with no effective treatments. Parenchymal accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles are the hallmarks of AD. Their possible interactions and synergistic effects in AD have been gradually elucidated. The failure of many clinical trials suggests that it is difficult to treat AD with a focus on a single target. Instead, multiple targets may be an important direction for AD drug research. In this study, we used protoporphyrin IX (PX)-modified oxidized mesoporous carbon nanospheres (OMCN) (PX@OMCN@PEG(OP)@RVGs) as a novel AD multifunctional nanodrug having multiple targets. The nanodrug efficiently inhibits tau phosphorylation. In addition, the use of PX with focused ultrasound triggered the production of reactive oxygen species that significantly inhibited Abeta aggregation. Both approaches notably increased the cognitive level of APP/PS1 transgenic (Tg) mice and ultimately achieved dual-target inhibition of AD. Furthermore, the safe and effective delivery of PX across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) due to modification of the RVG peptide was demonstrated in vivo and in vitro. The favorable photothermal effect of the nanoparticles improved the BBB permeability of PX@OP@RVGs under near-infrared irradiation. The results demonstrated that the novel PX@OP@RVG multifunctional nanomedicine has a dual-target treatment capability for AD and can traverse the BBB, indicating the potential for the effective treatment of AD.

30194389|t|Potent PDZ-Domain PICK1 Inhibitors that Modulate Amyloid Beta-Mediated Synaptic Dysfunction.
30194389|a|Protein interacting with C kinase (PICK1) is a scaffolding protein that is present in dendritic spines and interacts with a wide array of proteins through its PDZ domain. The best understood function of PICK1 is regulation of trafficking of AMPA receptors at neuronal synapses via its specific interaction with the AMPA GluA2 subunit. Disrupting the PICK1-GluA2 interaction has been shown to alter synaptic plasticity, a molecular mechanism of learning and memory. Lack of potent, selective inhibitors of the PICK1 PDZ domain has hindered efforts at exploring the PICK1-GluA2 interaction as a therapeutic target for neurological diseases. Here, we report the discovery of PICK1 small molecule inhibitors using a structure-based drug design strategy. The inhibitors stabilized surface GluA2, reduced Abeta-induced rise in intracellular calcium concentrations in cultured neurons, and blocked long term depression in brain slices. These findings demonstrate that it is possible to identify potent, selective PICK1-GluA2 inhibitors which may prove useful for treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.

30196289|t|Icariside II, a Phosphodiesterase-5 Inhibitor, Attenuates Beta-Amyloid-Induced Cognitive Deficits via BDNF/TrkB/CREB Signaling.
30196289|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Icariside II (ICS II) is an active component from Epimedium brevicornum, a Chinese medicine extensively used in China. Our previous study has proved that ICS II protects against learning and memory impairments and neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus induced by beta-amyloid25-35 (Abeta25-35) in rats. However, its in-depth underlying mechanisms remain still unclear. Hence this study was designed to explore the potential underlying mechanisms of ICS II by experiments with an in vivo model of Abeta25-35-induced cognitive deficits in rats combined with a neuronal-like PC12 cells injury in vitro model. METHODS: The cognitive deficits was measured using Morris water maze test, and apoptosis, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial ROS levels were detected by TUNEL, DCFH-DA and Mito-SOX staining, respectively. Expression of Bcl-2, Bax, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB), and cAMP response element binding (p-CREB) and active-Caspase 3 levels were evaluated by Western blot. RESULTS: It was found that ICS II, a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, significantly attenuated cognitive deficits caused by Abeta25-35 injection in rats, and ICS II not only significantly enhanced the expression of BDNF and TrkB, but also activated CREB. Furthermore, ICS II also significantly abrogated Abeta25-35-induced PC12 cell injury, and inhibited Abeta25-35-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, as well as mitochondrial ROS levels. In addition, ICS II up-regulated the expressions of BDNF and TrkB consistent with the findings in vivo. ANA-12, a TrkB inhibitor, blocked the neuroprotective effect of ICS II on Abeta25-35-induced neuronal injury. CONCLUSION: ICS II mitigates Abeta25-35-induced cognitive deficits and neuronal cell injury by upregulating the BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling, suggesting that ICS II can be used as a potential therapeutic agent for dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease.

30202077|t|A soy protein Lunasin can ameliorate amyloid-beta 42 mediated neurodegeneration in Drosophila eye.
30202077|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), a fatal progressive neurodegenerative disorder, also results from accumulation of amyloid-beta 42 (Abeta42) plaques. These Abeta42 plaques trigger oxidative stress, abnormal signaling, which results in neuronal death by unknown mechanism(s). We misexpress high levels of human Abeta42 in the differentiating retinal neurons of the Drosophila eye, which results in the Alzheimer's like neuropathology. Using our transgenic model, we tested a soy-derived protein Lunasin (Lun) for a possible role in rescuing neurodegeneration in retinal neurons. Lunasin is known to have anti-cancer effect and reduces stress and inflammation. We show that misexpression of Lunasin by transgenic approach can rescue Abeta42 mediated neurodegeneration by blocking cell death in retinal neurons, and results in restoration of axonal targeting from retina to brain. Misexpression of Lunasin downregulates the highly conserved cJun-N-terminal Kinase (JNK) signaling pathway. Activation of JNK signaling can prevent neuroprotective role of Lunasin in Abeta42 mediated neurodegeneration. This neuroprotective function of Lunasin is not dependent on retinal determination gene cascade in the Drosophila eye, and is independent of Wingless (Wg) and Decapentaplegic (Dpp) signaling pathways. Furthermore, Lunasin can significantly reduce mortality rate caused by misexpression of human Abeta42 in flies. Our studies identified the novel neuroprotective role of Lunasin peptide, a potential therapeutic agent that can ameliorate Abeta42 mediated neurodegeneration by downregulating JNK signaling.

30205358|a|Coexisting Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is common in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). To evaluate the cortical thinning in patients with DLB considering the effect of amyloid-beta (Abeta), we compared the regional cortical thickness between control subjects and patients with DLB with abnormal dopamine transporter imaging. Seventeen (43.6%) of 39 patients with DLB and no control subjects had significant Abeta deposition on 18F-florbetaben positron emission tomography. Compared to control (n = 15), Abeta-negative DLB group (n = 21) had cortical thinning in the bilateral insula, entorhinal, basal frontal, and occipito-parietal cortices. Compared to Abeta-negative DLB, Abeta-positive DLB group (n = 15) had a lower cortical thickness in the AD-prone brain regions in addition to the bilateral occipital, basal frontal, and somatomotor cortices. After controlling for the amount of Abeta deposition, DLB group had cortical thinning in the same regions affected in the Abeta-negative DLB group. In summary, patients with DLB had an Abeta-independent cortical thinning, while Abeta was associated with additional cortical thinning in the AD-prone brain regions and the aggravation of DLB-specific cortical thinning.

30211407|t|Bexarotene cannot reduce amyloid beta plaques through inhibition of production of amyloid beta peptides: in silico and in vitro study.
30211407|a|Recently, it has been reported that anti-cancer drug bexarotene can remarkably destroy amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques in mouse models suggesting therapeutic potential for Alzheimer's disease. However, the effect of bexarotene on clearance of plaques has not been seen in some mouse models. One of the possible mechanisms explaining this phenomenon is that bexarotene levels up expression of apolipoprotein 4 (ApoE4) leading to intracellular clearance of Abeta peptide. Therefore, an interesting question emerges of whether bexarotene can destroy Abeta plaques by direct interaction with them or by preventing production of Abeta peptides. In our previous work we have shown that bexarotene cannot clear amyloid aggregates due to their weak interaction using in silico and in vitro experiments. Here we explore the possibility of inhibiting Abeta production through bexarotene binding to beta-secretase which can cleave Abeta peptides from amyloid precursor protein. Using the molecular mechanics-Poisson-Boltzmann surface area method and all-atom simulations we have shown that bexarotene has a very low binding affinity to beta-secretase. This result has been also confirmed by our in vitro experiment implying that bexarotene cannot clear amyloid plaques through inhibition of Abeta production. We have also shown that bexarotene tightly binds to both peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs). Thus, our result does not contradict the hypothesis that the reduction of Abeta plaques occurs due to bexarotene-induced overexpression of ApoE4.

30213841|t|An Abeta42 variant that inhibits intra- and extracellular amyloid aggregation and enhances cell viability.
30213841|a|Aggregation and accumulation of the 42-residue amyloid beta peptide (Abeta42) in the extracellular matrix and within neuronal cells is considered a major cause of neuronal cell cytotoxicity and death in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Therefore, molecules that bind to Abeta42 and prevent its aggregation are therapeutically promising as AD treatment. Here, we show that a non-self-aggregating Abeta42 variant carrying two surface mutations, F19S and L34P (Abeta42DM), inhibits wild-type Abeta42 aggregation and significantly reduces Abeta42-mediated cell cytotoxicity. In addition, Abeta42DM inhibits the uptake and internalization of extracellularly added pre-formed Abeta42 aggregates into cells. This was the case in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells co-expressing Abeta42 and Abeta42DM or following pre-treatment of cells with extracellular soluble forms of the two peptides, even at high Abeta42 to Abeta42DM molar ratios. In cells, Abeta42DM associates with Abeta42, while in vitro, the two soluble recombinant peptides exhibit nano-molar binding affinity. Importantly, Abeta42DM potently suppresses Abeta42 amyloid aggregation in vitro, as demonstrated by thioflavin T fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy for detecting amyloid fibrils. Overall, we present a new approach for inhibiting Abeta42 fibril formation both within and outside cells. Accordingly, Abeta42DM should be evaluated in vivo for potential use as a therapeutic lead for treating AD.

30213975|t|Copper mediated amyloid-beta binding to Transthyretin.
30213975|a|Transthyretin (TTR), a homotetrameric protein that transports thyroxine and retinol both in plasma and in cerebrospinal (CSF) fluid provides a natural protective response against Alzheimer's disease (AD), modulates amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition by direct interaction and co-localizes with Abeta in plaques. TTR levels are lower in the CSF of AD patients. Zn2+, Mn2+ and Fe2+ transform TTR into a protease able to cleave Abeta. To explain these activities, monomer dissociation or conformational changes have been suggested. Here, we report that when TTR crystals are exposed to copper or iron salts, the tetramer undergoes a significant conformational change that alters the dimer-dimer interface and rearranges residues implicated in TTR's ability to neutralize Abeta. We also describe the conformational changes in TTR upon the binding of the various metal ions. Furthermore, using bio-layer interferometry (BLI) with immobilized Abeta(1-28), we observe the binding of TTR only in the presence of copper. Such Cu2+-dependent binding suggests a recognition mechanism whereby Cu2+ modulates both the TTR conformation, induces a complementary Abeta structure and may participate in the interaction. Cu2+-soaked TTR crystals show a conformation different from that induced by Fe2+, and intriguingly, TTR crystals grown in presence of Abeta(1-28) show different positions for the copper sites from those grown its absence.

30215519|t|Surveying the Energy Landscapes of Abeta Fibril Polymorphism.
30215519|a|Many unrelated proteins and peptides have been found spontaneously to form amyloid fibers above a critical concentration. Even for a single sequence, however, the amyloid fold is not a single well-defined structure. Although the cross-beta hydrogen bonding pattern is common to all amyloids, all other aspects of amyloid fiber structures are sensitive to both the sequence of the aggregating peptides and the solvent conditions under which the aggregation occurs. Amyloid fibers are easy to identify and grossly characterize using microscopy, but their insolubility and aperiodicity along the dimensions transverse to the fiber axis have complicated detailed experimental structural characterization. In this paper, we explore the landscape of possibilities for amyloid protofilament structures that are made up of a single stack of peptides associated in a parallel in-register manner. We view this landscape as a two-dimensional version of the usual three-dimensional protein folding problem: the survey of the two-dimensional folds of protein ribbons. Adopting this view leads to a practical method of predicting stable protofilament structures of arbitrary sequences. We apply this scheme to variants of Abeta, the amyloid forming peptide that is characteristically associated with Alzheimer's disease. Consistent with what is known from experiment, we find that Abeta protofibrils are polymorphic. To our surprise, however, the ribbon-folding landscape of Abeta turned out to be strikingly simple. We confirm that, at the level of the monomeric protofilament, the landscape for the Abeta sequence is reasonably well funneled toward structures that are similar to those that have been determined by experiment. The landscape has more distinct minima than does a typical globular protein landscape but fewer and deeper minima than the landscape of a randomly shuffled sequence having the same overall composition. It is tempting to consider the possibility that the significant degree of funneling of Abeta's ribbon-folding landscape has arisen as a result of natural selection. More likely, however, the intermediate complexity of Abeta's ribbon-folding landscape has come from the post facto selection of the Abeta sequence as an object of study by researchers because only by having a landscape with some degree of funneling can ordered aggregation of such a peptide occur at in vivo concentrations. In addition to predicting polymorph structures, we show that predicted solubilities of polymorphs correlate with experiment and with their elongation free energies computed by coarse-grained molecular dynamics.

30219939|t|Sex and age interact to determine clinicopathologic differences in Alzheimer's disease.
30219939|a|Women reportedly make up two-thirds of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia sufferers. Many estimates regarding AD, however, are based on clinical series lacking autopsy confirmation. The Florida Autopsied Multi-Ethnic (FLAME) cohort was queried for AD cases with a total of 1625 identified ranging in age from 53 to 102 years at death. Standard neuropathologic procedures were employed and clinical information was retrospectively collected. Clinicopathologic and genetic data (MAPT and APOE) were stratified by sex. Within the neuropathologically diagnosed AD cohort, the overall number of women and men did not differ. Men were younger at onset of cognitive symptoms, had a shorter disease duration, and more often had atypical (non-amnestic) clinical presentations. The frequency of autopsy-confirmed AD among women and men stratified by age at death revealed an inverse U-shaped curve in men and a U-shaped curve in women, with both curves having inflections at approximately 70 years of age. Regional counts of neurofibrillary tangles differed in women and men, especially when examined by age intervals. Women had overall greater severity of neurofibrillary tangle counts compared to men, especially in the hippocampus. Men were more often classified as hippocampal sparing AD, whereas limbic predominant AD was more common in women. Men and women did not differ in frequency of MAPT haplotype or APOE genotype. Atypical clinical presentations, younger age at onset and shorter disease duration were more frequent in men, suggesting that the lower reported frequency of AD in men may be due to more frequent atypical clinical presentations not recognized as AD. Our data suggest that neuropathologically diagnosed AD cases have the same frequency of women and men, but their clinical presentations and ages at onset tend to differ.

30222606|t|Rapidly Progressive Dementia in the Outpatient Clinic: More Than Prions.
30222606|a|BACKGROUND: Published approaches to the evaluation and management of patients with rapidly progressive dementia (RPD) have been largely informed by experience at academic hospitals and national centers specializing in the diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Whether these approaches can be applied to patients assessed within lower-acuity outpatient settings is unknown. METHODS: A total of 96 patients with suspected RPD were assessed within the Washington University School of Medicine (Saint Louis, MO) outpatient memory clinic from February 2006 to February 2016. Consensus etiologic diagnoses were established following independent review of clinical data by 2 dementia specialists. RESULTS: In total, 67/90 (70%) patients manifested with faster-than-expected cognitive decline leading to dementia within 2 years of symptom onset. Female sex (42/67, 63%), median patient age (68.3 y; range, 45.4 to 89.6), and years of education (12 y; range, 6 to 14) were consistent with clinic demographics. Atypical presentations of common neurodegenerative dementing illnesses accounted for 90% (60/67) of RPD cases. Older age predicted a higher odds of amnestic Alzheimer disease dementia (OR, 2.1 per decade; 95% CI, 1.1-3.8; P=0.02). Parkinsonism (OR, 6.9; 95% CI, 1.6-30.5; P=0.01) or cortical visual dysfunction (OR, 10.8; 95% CI, 1.7-69.4; P=0.01) predicted higher odds of another neurodegenerative cause of RPD, including sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The clinical environment influences the prevalence of RPD causes. The clinical evaluation should be adapted to promote detection of common causes of RPD, specific to the practice setting.

30222975|t|Interaction of the beta amyloid - Abeta(25-35) - peptide with zwitterionic and negatively charged vesicles with and without cholesterol.
30222975|a|The interactions of the Alzheimer's beta-amyloid peptide, Abeta(25-35), with 18:1 (Delta9-Cis) PC 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine (EPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-rac-glycerol) (sodium salt) (DOPG), and L-alpha-phosphatidylglycerol (EPG) phospholipid vesicles with and without cholesterol (Ch) are studied by the nitroxide spin probe electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) method. Two nitroxide spin probes, 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidin-1-oxyl-4-yl hexadecanoate (TP, TEMPO-Palmitate) and 2-Ethyl-2-(15-methoxy-15-oxopentadecyl)-4,4-dimethyl-3-oxazolidinyloxy (16-DSE), are utilized in the study. TEMPO-Palmitate has the reporting EPR moiety located at the top of this spin probe, while 16-DSE has the reporting EPR moiety located at the tail of the spin probe. These two probes enable us to sample the surface and the middle of the phospholipid bilayer, respectively. All EPR measurements are done above the melting points of all four phospholipids when the bilayer is in the liquid crystal phase, the physiologically relevant phase. Due to non-linear spectral line fitting, the EPR spectral parameters are extracted with high precision. The results show that there are two populations of Abeta(25-35) and that one of them is located in the hydrophobic phospholipid layer below the hydrophilic headgroup region. The second population appears to be weakly coupled to the surface of the bilayer. Both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions affect the insertion of Abeta(25-35) in the bilayer. Also, there is strong evidence for an interaction between cholesterol and Abeta(25-35), which affects the dielectric and dynamic properties of the bilayer.

30224067|t|Effect of growth differentiation factor-15 secreted by human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells on amyloid beta levels in in vitro and in vivo models of Alzheimer's disease.
30224067|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common progressive neurodegenerative disease, causes learning and memory impairment. The pathological progress of AD can derive from imbalanced homeostasis of amyloid beta (Abeta) in the brain. In such cases, microglia play important roles in regulating the brain Abeta levels. In the present study, we found that human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB-MSCs) can increase, through paracrine action, the ability of microglial cells to clear Abeta. In order to identify the associated paracrine factors, a secretome of hUCB-MSCs co-cultured with Abeta-treated BV2 microglial cells was analyzed using a human cytokine protein array. As a result, growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) was identified as a predominant candidate, and its association with Abeta clearance by microglial cells was investigated in vitro and in a 5XFAD mouse model. When Abeta-treated BV2 cells were treated with exogenous recombinant GDF-15, the Abeta levels in the culture medium decreased. Moreover, GDF-15 injection in the brain parenchyma of 5XFAD mice also led to decrease in Abeta plaques. In contrast, co-culture of BV2 cells and hUCB-MSCs treated with GDF-15-specific siRNA did not influence the Abeta levels in the culture medium. To elucidate how these phenomena are related, we confirmed that GDF-15 specifically increases insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) expression in microglial cells through TGFbeta receptor type II (TGFbetaRII), both in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that hUCB-MSCs promote the Abeta clearance ability of microglial cells through regulation of GDF-15 secretion, thus elucidating a therapeutic mechanism for AD.

30227353|t|Rationally designed divalent caffeic amides inhibit amyloid-beta fibrillization, induce fibril dissociation, and ameliorate cytotoxicity.
30227353|a|One of the pathologic hallmarks in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is extracellular senile plaques composed of amyloid-beta (Abeta) fibrils. Blocking Abeta self-assembly or disassembling Abeta aggregates by small molecules would be potential therapeutic strategies to treat AD. In this study, we synthesized a series of rationally designed divalent compounds and examined their effects on Abeta fibrillization. A divalent amide (2) derived from two molecules of caffeic acid with a propylenediamine linker of ~5.0 A in length, which is close to the distance of adjacent beta sheets in Abeta fibrils, showed good potency to inhibit Abeta(1-42) fibrillization. Furthermore, compound 2 effectively dissociated the Abeta(1-42) preformed fibrils. The cytotoxicity induced by Abeta(1-42) aggregates in human neuroblastoma was reduced in the presence of 2, and feeding 2 to Abeta transgenic C. elegans rescued the paralysis phenotype. In addition, the binding and stoichiometry of 2 to Abeta(1-40) were demonstrated by using electrospray ionization-traveling wave ion mobility-mass spectrometry, while molecular dynamic simulation was conducted to gain structural insights into the Abeta(1-40)-2 complex.

30231896|t|Amyloid positron emission tomography and cerebrospinal fluid results from a crenezumab anti-amyloid-beta antibody double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized phase II study in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (BLAZE).
30231896|a|BACKGROUND: We investigated the effect of crenezumab, a humanized anti-amyloid-beta (Abeta) immunoglobulin (Ig)G4 monoclonal antibody, on biomarkers of amyloid pathology, neurodegeneration, and disease progression in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: This double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized phase II study enrolled patients with mild-to-moderate AD and a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 18-26. In part 1 of the study, patients were 2:1 randomized to receive low-dose subcutaneous (SC) 300 mg crenezumab every 2 weeks (q2w) or placebo for 68 weeks; in part 2, patients were 2:1 randomized to receive high-dose intravenous (IV) 15 mg/kg crenezumab every 4 weeks (q4w) or placebo for 68 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in amyloid burden from baseline to week 69 assessed by florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) in the modified intent-to-treat population. Secondary endpoints were change from baseline to week 69 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and fluorodeoxyglucose PET, and change from baseline to week 73 in 12-point Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog12) and Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). Safety was assessed in patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. RESULTS: From August 2011 to September 2012, 91 patients were enrolled and randomized (low-dose SC cohort: crenezumab (n = 26) or placebo (n = 13); high-dose IV cohort: crenezumab (n = 36) or placebo (n = 16)). The primary endpoint was not met using a prespecified cerebellar reference region to calculate standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) from florbetapir PET. Exploratory analyses using subcortical white matter reference regions showed nonsignificant trends toward slower accumulation of plaque amyloid in the high-dose IV cohort. In both cohorts, a significant mean increase from baseline in CSF Abeta(1-42) levels versus placebo was observed. Nonsignificant trends toward ADAS-Cog12 and CDR-SB benefits were identified in a mild (MMSE 20-26) subset of the high-dose IV cohort. No amyloid-related imaging abnormalities due to edema/effusion were observed. CONCLUSION: The primary endpoint was not met. Exploratory findings suggest potential Abeta target engagement with crenezumab and possible slower accumulation of plaque amyloid. Studies investigating the effects of higher doses of crenezumab on amyloid load and disease progression are ongoing. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01397578 . Registered on 18 July 2011.

30232227|t|Axonal organization defects in the hippocampus of adult conditional BACE1 knockout mice.
30232227|a|beta-Site APP (amyloid precursor protein) cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the beta-secretase enzyme that initiates production of the toxic amyloid-beta peptide that accumulates in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hence, BACE1 is a prime therapeutic target, and several BACE1 inhibitor drugs are currently being tested in clinical trials for AD. However, the safety of BACE1 inhibition is unclear. Germline BACE1 knockout mice have multiple neurological phenotypes, although these could arise from BACE1 deficiency during development. To address this question, we report that tamoxifen-inducible conditional BACE1 knockout mice in which the Bace1 gene was ablated in the adult largely lacked the phenotypes observed in germline BACE1 knockout mice. However, one BACE1-null phenotype was induced after Bace1 gene deletion in the adult mouse brain. This phenotype showed reduced length and disorganization of the hippocampal mossy fiber infrapyramidal bundle, the axonal pathway of dentate gyrus granule cells that is maintained by neurogenesis in the mouse brain. This defect in axonal organization correlated with reduced BACE1-mediated cleavage of the neural cell adhesion protein close homolog of L1 (CHL1), which has previously been associated with axon guidance. Although our results indicate that BACE1 inhibition in the adult mouse brain may avoid phenotypes associated with BACE1 deficiency during embryonic and postnatal development, they also suggest that BACE1 inhibitor drugs developed for treating AD may disrupt the organization of an axonal pathway in the hippocampus, an important structure for learning and memory.

30232325|t|A role for APP in Wnt signalling links synapse loss with beta-amyloid production.
30232325|a|In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the canonical Wnt inhibitor Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1) is induced by beta-amyloid (Abeta) and shifts the balance from canonical towards non-canonical Wnt signalling. Canonical (Wnt-beta-catenin) signalling promotes synapse stability, while non-canonical (Wnt-PCP) signalling favours synapse retraction; thus Abeta-driven synapse loss is mediated by Dkk1. Here we show that the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) co-activates both arms of Wnt signalling through physical interactions with Wnt co-receptors LRP6 and Vangl2, to bi-directionally modulate synapse stability. Furthermore, activation of non-canonical Wnt signalling enhances Abeta production, while activation of canonical signalling suppresses Abeta production. Together, these findings identify a pathogenic-positive feedback loop in which Abeta induces Dkk1 expression, thereby activating non-canonical Wnt signalling to promote synapse loss and drive further Abeta production. The Swedish familial AD variant of APP (APPSwe) more readily co-activates non-canonical, at the expense of canonical Wnt activity, indicating that its pathogenicity likely involves direct effects on synapses, in addition to increased Abeta production. Finally, we report that pharmacological inhibition of the Abeta-Dkk1-Abeta positive feedback loop with the drug fasudil can restore the balance between Wnt pathways, prevent dendritic spine withdrawal in vitro, and reduce Abeta load in vivo in mice with advanced amyloid pathology. These results clarify a relationship between Abeta accumulation and synapse loss and provide direction for the development of potential disease-modifying treatments.

30232364|t|Time course of focused ultrasound effects on beta-amyloid plaque pathology in the TgCRND8 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
30232364|a|Previous studies have demonstrated that temporarily increasing the permeability of the blood-brain barrier using focused ultrasound can reduce beta-amyloid plaque load and improve cognitive function in animal models of Alzheimer's disease. However, the underlying mechanism and duration for which the effects of one treatment persists for are unknown. Here, we used in vivo two-photon fluorescence microscopy to track changes in beta-amyloid plaque sizes in the TgCRND8 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease after one focused ultrasound treatment. We found that one treatment reduced plaques to 62 +- 16% (p <= 0.001) of their original volume two days post-sonication; this decrease in size persisted for two weeks. We then sought to evaluate the effectiveness of biweekly focused ultrasound treatments using magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound treatments. Three to five biweekly treatments resulted in a 27 +- 7% (p <= 0.01) decrease in plaque number and 40 +- 10% (p <= 0.01) decrease in plaque surface area compared to untreated littermates. This study demonstrates that one focused ultrasound treatment reduces the size of existing beta-amyloid plaques for two weeks, and that repeated biweekly focused ultrasound treatments is an effective method of reducing beta-amyloid pathology in moderate-to-late stages of Alzheimer's disease.

30234103|t|Synthesis and Characterization of Oligothiophene-Porphyrin-Based Molecules That Can Be Utilized for Optical Assignment of Aggregated Amyloid-beta Morphotypes.
30234103|a|Molecular tools for fluorescent imaging of protein aggregates are essential for understanding the significance of these pathological hallmarks in proteopathic neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. Here, we report the synthesis of a series of oligothiophene porphyrin hybrids, OTPHs, and the evaluation of these dyes for fluorescent imaging of beta-amyloid aggregates in tissue sections from a transgenic mouse model with Alzheimer's disease pathology. The OTPHs proved to be successful for spectral and lifetime imaging assessment of protein deposits and our findings confirm that the enhanced spectral range and distinct lifetime diversity of these novel tools allow a more precise assessment of heterogeneous amyloid morphology compared with the corresponding oligothiophene dye. In addition, the chemical identity of the porphyrin moiety, as well as the spacing between the two optical active moieties, influenced the OTPHs performance for fluorescent assignment of the protein deposits. We foresee that our findings will aid in the chemical design of dyes that can be utilized as optical tools for studying the polymorphic nature of protein aggregates associated with proteopathic neurodegenerative diseases.

30237470|t|A new era for understanding amyloid structures and disease.
30237470|a|The aggregation of proteins into amyloid fibrils and their deposition into plaques and intracellular inclusions is the hallmark of amyloid disease. The accumulation and deposition of amyloid fibrils, collectively known as amyloidosis, is associated with many pathological conditions that can be associated with ageing, such as Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, type II diabetes and dialysis-related amyloidosis. However, elucidation of the atomic structure of amyloid fibrils formed from their intact protein precursors and how fibril formation relates to disease has remained elusive. Recent advances in structural biology techniques, including cryo-electron microscopy and solid-state NMR spectroscopy, have finally broken this impasse. The first near-atomic-resolution structures of amyloid fibrils formed in vitro, seeded from plaque material and analysed directly ex vivo are now available. The results reveal cross-beta structures that are far more intricate than anticipated. Here, we describe these structures, highlighting their similarities and differences, and the basis for their toxicity. We discuss how amyloid structure may affect the ability of fibrils to spread to different sites in the cell and between organisms in a prion-like manner, along with their roles in disease. These molecular insights will aid in understanding the development and spread of amyloid diseases and are inspiring new strategies for therapeutic intervention.

30239611|t|White matter diffusion alterations precede symptom onset in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease.
30239611|a|White matter alterations are present in the majority of patients with Alzheimer's disease type dementia. However, the spatiotemporal pattern of white matter changes preceding dementia symptoms in Alzheimer's disease remains unclear, largely due to the inherent diagnostic uncertainty in the preclinical phase and increased risk of confounding age-related vascular disease and stroke in late-onset Alzheimer's disease. In early-onset autosomal-dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease, participants are destined to develop dementia, which provides the opportunity to assess brain changes years before the onset of symptoms, and in the absence of ageing-related vascular disease. Here, we assessed mean diffusivity alterations in the white matter in 64 mutation carriers compared to 45 non-carrier family non-carriers. Using tract-based spatial statistics, we mapped the interaction of mutation status by estimated years from symptom onset on mean diffusivity. For major atlas-derived fibre tracts, we determined the earliest time point at which abnormal mean diffusivity changes in the mutation carriers were detectable. Lastly, we assessed the association between mean diffusivity and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of amyloid, tau, phosphorylated-tau, and soluble TREM2, i.e. a marker of microglia activity. Results showed a significant interaction of mutations status by estimated years from symptom onset, i.e. a stronger increase of mean diffusivity, within the posterior parietal and medial frontal white matter in mutation carriers compared with non-carriers. The earliest increase of mean diffusivity was observed in the forceps major, forceps minor and long projecting fibres-many connecting default mode network regions-between 5 to 10 years before estimated symptom onset. Higher mean diffusivity in fibre tracts was associated with lower grey matter volume in the tracts' projection zones. Global mean diffusivity was correlated with lower cerebrospinal fluid levels of amyloid-beta1-42 but higher levels of tau, phosphorylated-tau and soluble TREM2. Together, these results suggest that regionally selective white matter degeneration occurs years before the estimated symptom onset. Such white matter alterations are associated with primary Alzheimer's disease pathology and microglia activity in the brain.

30242891|t|Stabilizing proteins to prevent conformational changes required for amyloid fibril formation.
30242891|a|Amyloid fibrillation is associated with several human maladies, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's diseases, prions, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and type 2 diabetes diseases. Gaining insights into the mechanism of amyloid fibril formation and exploring novel approaches to fibrillation inhibition are crucial for preventing amyloid diseases. Here, we hypothesized that ligands capable of stabilizing the native state of query proteins might prevent protein unfolding, which, in turn, may reduce the propensity of proteins to form amyloid fibrils. We demonstrated the efficient inhibition of amyloid formation of the human serum albumin (HSA) (up to 85%) and human insulin (up to 80%) by a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, ibuprofen (IBFN). IBFN significantly increases the conformational stability of both HSA and insulin, as confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Moreover, increasing concentration of IBFN boosts its amyloid inhibitory propensity in a linear fashion by influencing the nucleation phase as assayed by thioflavin T fluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, and dynamic light scattering. Furthermore, circular dichroism analysis supported the DSC results, showing that IBFN binds to the native state of proteins and almost completely prevents their tendency to lose secondary and tertiary structures. Cell toxicity assay confirms that species formed in the presence of IBFN are less toxic to neuronal cells (SH-SY5Y). These results demonstrate the feasibility of using a small molecule to stabilize the native state of proteins, thereby preventing the amyloidogenic conformational changes, which appear to be the common link in several human amyloid diseases.

30243924|t|An updated Alzheimer hypothesis: Complement C3 and risk of Alzheimer's disease-A cohort study of 95,442 individuals.
30243924|a|INTRODUCTION: We tested the hypothesis that low plasma complement C3 is observationally and genetically associated with high risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: We studied 95,442 individuals enrolled in the Copenhagen General Population Study. In genetic analyses, we further included 8367 individuals from the Copenhagen City Heart Study. In the two studies, 1189 and 35 developed AD during median 8 years follow-up. RESULTS: The multifactorially adjusted hazard ratio for risk of AD for a one standard deviation lower levels of complement C3 was 1.11 (95% confidence interval: 1.04-1.19) in all individuals and 1.66 (1.33-2.07) in APOE epsilon44 carriers. In Mendelian randomization, the corresponding genetic estimates were 1.66 (1.05-2.63) overall and 1.99 (0.52-7.65) in APOE epsilon44 carriers. DISCUSSION: Low baseline levels of complement C3 were associated with high risk of AD. The risk was amplified in APOE epsilon44 highly susceptible individuals, and these findings were substantiated by a Mendelian randomization approach, potentially implying causality. Based on these findings, we present and thoroughly discuss an updated Alzheimer hypothesis incorporating low complement C3 levels.

30246866|t|Abeta and the dementia syndrome: Simple versus complex perspectives.
30246866|a|BACKGROUND: The amyloid cascade hypothesis (ACH) has dominated strategy in dementia research for decades despite evidence of its limitations including known heterogeneity of the dementia syndrome in the population and the narrow focus on a single molecule - the amyloid beta protein (Abeta) as causal for all Alzheimer-type dementia. Other hypotheses relevant to Abeta are the presenilin (PS) hypothesis (PSH) relating to the involvement of PS in the generation of Abeta, and the amyloid precursor protein (APP) matrix approach (AMA), relating to the complex and dynamic breakdown of APP, from which Abeta derives. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this article we explore perspectives relating to complex disorders occurring mainly in older populations through a detailed case study of the role of Abeta in AD. RESULTS: Scrutiny of the evidence generated so far reveals and a lack of understanding of the wider APP proteolytic system and how narrow research into the dementia syndrome has been to date. Confounding factors add significant limitations to the understanding of the current evidence base. CONCLUSIONS: A better characterisation of the entire APP proteolytic system in the human brain is urgently required to place Abeta in its complex physiological context. From a molecular perspective, a combination of the alternative hypotheses, the PSH and the AMA may better describe the complexity of the APP proteolytic system leading to new therapeutic approaches. The reductionist approach is widespread throughout biomedical research and this example highlights how neglect of complexity can undermine investigations of complex disorders, particularly those arising in the oldest in our populations.

30250223|t|Enantiomeric Abeta peptides inhibit the fluid shear stress response of PIEZO1.
30250223|a|Traumatic brain injury (TBI) elevates Abeta (Abeta) peptides in the brain and cerebral spinal fluid. Abeta peptides are amphipathic molecules that can modulate membrane mechanics. Because the mechanosensitive cation channel PIEZO1 is gated by membrane tension and curvature, it prompted us to test the effects of Abeta on PIEZO1. Using precision fluid shear stress as a stimulus, we found that Abeta monomers inhibit PIEZO1 at femtomolar to picomolar concentrations. The Abeta oligomers proved much less potent. The effect of Abetas on Piezo gating did not involve peptide-protein interactions since the D and L enantiomers had similar effects. Incubating a fluorescent derivative of Abeta and a fluorescently tagged PIEZO1, we showed that Abeta can colocalize with PIEZO1, suggesting that they both had an affinity for particular regions of the bilayer. To better understand the PIEZO1 inhibitory effects of Abeta, we examined their effect on wound healing. We observed that over-expression of PIEZO1 in HEK293 cells increased cell migration velocity ~10-fold, and both enantiomeric Abeta peptides and GsMTx4 independently inhibited migration, demonstrating involvement of PIEZO1 in cell motility. As part of the motility study we examined the correlation of PIEZO1 function with tension in the cytoskeleton using a genetically encoded fluorescent stress probe. Abeta peptides increased resting stress in F-actin, and is correlated with Abeta block of PIEZO1-mediated Ca2+ influx. Abeta inhibition of PIEZO1 in the absence of stereospecific peptide-protein interactions shows that Abeta peptides modulate both cell membrane and cytoskeletal mechanics to control PIEZO1-triggered Ca2+ influx.

30253196|t|Centella asiatica attenuates hippocampal mitochondrial dysfunction and improves memory and executive function in beta-amyloid overexpressing mice.
30253196|a|Centella asiatica is a medicinal plant used to enhance memory. We have previously shown that a water extract of Centella asiatica (CAW) attenuates beta-amyloid (Abeta)-induced spatial memory deficits in mice and improves neuronal health. Yet the effect of CAW on other cognitive domains remains unexplored as does its in vivo mechanism of improving Abeta-related cognitive impairment. This study investigates the effects of CAW on learning, memory and executive function as well as mitochondrial function and antioxidant response in the 5xFAD model of Abeta accumulation. Seven month old 5xFAD female mice were treated with CAW (2 mg/mL) in their drinking water for two weeks prior to behavioral testing. Learning, memory and executive function were assessed using the object location memory task (OLM), conditioned fear response (CFR) and odor discrimination reversal learning (ODRL) test. Mitochondrial function was profiled using the Seahorse XF platform in hippocampal mitochondria isolated from these animals and tissue was harvested for assessment of mitochondrial, antioxidant and synaptic proteins. CAW improved performance in all behavioral tests in the 5xFAD but had no effect on WT animals. Hippocampal mitochondrial function was improved and hippocampal and cortical expression of mitochondrial genes was increased in CAW-treated 5xFAD mice. Gene expression of the transcription factor NRF2, as well as its antioxidant target enzymes, was also increased with CAW treatment in both WT and 5xFAD mice. CAW treatment also decreased Abeta-plaque burden in the hippocampus of treated 5xFAD mice but had no effect on plaques in the cortex. These data show that CAW can improve many facets of Abeta-related cognitive impairment in 5xFAD mice. Oral treatment with CAW also attenuates hippocampal mitochondrial dysfunction in these animals. Because mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress accompany cognitive impairment in many pathological conditions beyond Alzheimer's disease, this suggests potentially broad therapeutic utility of CAW.

30257187|t|Reduced retromer function results in the accumulation of amyloid-beta oligomers.
30257187|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a progressive loss of multiple cognitive functions. Accumulation of amyloid beta oligomers (oAbeta) play a major role in the neurotoxicity associated with the disease process. One of the early affected brain regions is the hippocampus, wherein a reduction of the vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 35 (VPS35), the core protein comprising the retromer complex involved in cellular cargo sorting, has been identified. To investigate the role of the retromer function on the accumulation and clearance of oAbeta, we reduced retromer function by selectively inhibiting VPS35 gene expression using siRNA in differentiated neuronal SH-SY5Y cells. As cell-to-cell transfer of oAbeta to new brain regions is believed to be important for disease progression we investigated the effect of VPS35 reduction both in cells with direct uptake of oAbeta and in cells receiving oAbeta from donor cells. We demonstrate that reduced retromer function increases oAbeta accumulation in both cell systems, both the number of cells containing intracellular oAbeta and the amount within them. This effect was shown at different time points and regardless if the oAbeta originated from the extracellular milieu or via a direct neuronal cell-to-cell transfer. Interestingly, not only did reduced VPS35 cause oAbeta accumulation, but oAbeta treatment alone also lead to a reduction of VPS35 protein content. The accumulated oAbeta seems to co-localize with VPS35 and early endosome markers. Together, these findings provide evidence that reduced retromer function decreases the ability for neurons to transport and clear neurotoxic oAbeta received through different routes resulting in the accumulation of oAbeta. Thus, enhancing retromer function may be a potential therapeutic strategy to slow down the pathophysiology associated with the progression of AD.

30257562|t|Preferential Intercalation of Human Amyloid-beta Peptide into Interbilayer Region of Lipid-Raft Membrane in Macromolecular Crowding Environment.
30257562|a|This study focuses on the interaction of human amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) with a lipid-raft model membrane under macromolecular crowding conditions that mimic the intracellular environment. Abeta is central to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and has been studied extensively to determine the molecular mechanisms of Abeta-induced cellular dysfunctions underlying the pathogenesis of AD. According to evidence from spectroscopic studies, ganglioside clusters are key to the fibrillization process of Abeta. Gangliosides are a major component of glycosphingolipids and are acidic lipids of the central nervous system known to form so-called lipid rafts. In this study, the small unilamellar vesicle (SUV) membrane, composed of monosialogangliosides, cholesterol, and 1,2-dipalmitoyl- sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, did not show any structural changes after the addition of Abeta under noncrowding conditions. However, the addition of Abeta under crowding conditions induced shape deformation and aggregation to SUV resulting in multilamellar stacking. The time evolution of the lamellar peak suggested the preferential cohesion or intercalation of the Abeta peptide into the interbilayer region. This phenomenon was only observed at the gel (Lbeta) phase. These results suggest that an intracellular crowding environment promotes Abeta-membrane interaction and a selective accumulation of Abeta peptides into the interbilayer regions.

30257642|t|Salivary beta amyloid protein levels are detectable and differentiate patients with Alzheimer's disease dementia from normal controls: preliminary findings.
30257642|a|BACKGROUND: Peripheral diagnostics for Alzheimer's disease (AD) continue to be developed. Diagnostics capable of detecting AD before the onset of symptoms are particularly desirable, and, given the fact that early detection is imperative for alleviating long-term symptoms of the disease, methods which enable detection in the earliest stages are urgently needed. Saliva testing is non-invasive, and saliva is easy to acquire. A simple, non-invasive saliva test can potentially be used as an adjunct to diagnose AD during its earliest stages. METHODS: Salivary levels of beta amyloid 42 (Abeta42) were quantitated with enzyme-linked immunosorbent-type assays. Fifteen AD patients (7 men, mean age 77.8 +- 1.8 years, mean Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] score 19.0 +- 1.3) and 7 normal controls (2 men, mean age 60.4 +- 4.7 years, mean MMSE 29.0 +- 0.4) were enrolled. RESULTS: Salivary Abeta42 levels were significantly higher in AD patients than in controls (51.7 +- 1.6 pg/mL for AD and 21.1 +- 0.3 pg/mL for controls, p < 0.001). Based on these results, saliva testing appears to be a promising method for detecting AD during its critical early stages.

30261895|t|alpha1-antitrypsin mitigates NLRP3-inflammasome activation in amyloid beta1-42-stimulated murine astrocytes.
30261895|a|BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation has an essential impact on the pathogenesis and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mostly mediated by microglia and astrocytes, inflammatory processes lead to degeneration of neuronal cells. The NLRP3-inflammasome (NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3) is a key component of the innate immune system and its activation results in secretion of the proinflammatory effectors interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and interleukin-18 (IL-18). Under physiological conditions, cytosolic NLRP3-inflammsome is maintained in an inactive form, not able to oligomerize. Amyloid beta1-42 (Abeta1-42) triggers activation of NLRP3-inflammasome in microglia and astrocytes, inducing oligomerization and thus recruitment of proinflammatory proteases. NLRP3-inflammasome was found highly expressed in human brains diagnosed with AD. Moreover, NLRP3-deficient mice carrying mutations associated with familial AD were partially protected from deficits associated with AD. The endogenous protease inhibitor alpha1-antitrypsin (A1AT) is known for its anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties and thus could serve as therapeutic agent for NLRP3-inhibition. A1AT protects neurons from glutamate-induced toxicity and reduces Abeta1-42-induced inflammation in microglial cells. In this study, we investigated the effect of Abeta1-42-induced NLRP3-inflammasome upregulation in primary murine astrocytes and its regulation by A1AT. METHODS: Primary cortical astrocytes from BALB/c mice were stimulated with Abeta1-42 and treated with A1AT. Regulation of NLRP3-inflammasome was examined by immunocytochemistry, PCR, western blot and ELISA. Our studies included an inhibitor of NLRP3 to elucidate direct interactions between A1AT and NLRP3-inflammasome components. RESULTS: Our study revealed that A1AT reduces Abeta1-42-dependent upregulation of NLRP3 at the mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, A1AT time-dependently mitigated the expression of caspase 1 and its cleavage product IL-1beta in Abeta1-42-stimulated astrocytes. CONCLUSION: We conclude that Abeta1-42-stimulation results in an upregulation of NLRP3, caspase 1, and its cleavage products in astrocytes. A1AT time-dependently hampers neuroinflammation by downregulation of Abeta1-42-mediated NLRP3-inflammasome expression and thus may serve as a pharmaceutical opportunity for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

30264411|t|Development of a cerebrovascular magnetic resonance imaging biomarker for cognitive aging.
30264411|a|OBJECTIVE: Recent availability of amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET) has provided us with a unique opportunity to measure the association of systemic vascular health with brain health after accounting for the impact of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathologies. We wanted to quantify early cerebrovascular health-related magnetic resonance imaging brain measures (structure, perfusion, microstructural integrity) and evaluate their utility as a biomarker for cerebrovascular health. METHODS: We used 2 independent samples (discovery, n = 390; validation, n = 1,035) of individuals, aged >= 60 years, along the cognitive continuum with imaging from the population-based sample of Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. We ascertained vascular health by summing up recently existing cardiovascular and metabolic conditions (CMC) from health care records (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and stroke). Using multiple regression models, we quantified associations between CMC and brain health after accounting for age, sex, education/occupation, and AD burden (from amyloid and tau PET). RESULTS: Systemic vascular health was associated with medial temporal lobe thinning, widespread cerebral hypoperfusion, and loss of microstructural integrity in several white matter tracts including the corpus callosum and fornix. Further investigations suggested that microstructural integrity of the genu of the corpus callosum was suitable for assessing prodromal cerebrovascular health, had similar distributions in the discovery and independent validation datasets, and predicted cognitive performance above and beyond amyloid deposition. INTERPRETATION: Systemic vascular health has significant impact on brain structure and function. Quantifying prodromal cerebrovascular health-related brain measures that are independent of AD pathology-related changes has great utility for cognitive aging. Ann Neurol 2018;84:713-724.

30265526|t|Redox Kinetics of the Amyloid-beta-Cu Complex and Its Biological Implications.
30265526|a|The ability of the amyloid-beta peptide to bind to redox active metals and act as a source of radical damage in Alzheimer's disease has been largely accepted as contributing to the disease's pathogenesis. However, a kinetic understanding of the molecular mechanism, which underpins this radical generation, has yet to be reported. Here we use a sensitive fluorescence approach, which reports on the oxidation state of the metal bound to the amyloid-beta peptide and can therefore shed light on the redox kinetics. We confirm that the redox goes via a low populated, reactive intermediate and that the reaction proceeds via the Component I coordination environment rather than Component II. We also show that while the reduction step readily occurs (on the 10 ms time scale) it is the oxidation step that is rate-limiting for redox cycling.

30266595|t|SynAggreg: A Multifunctional High-Throughput Technology for Precision Study of Amyloid Aggregation and Systematic Discovery of Synergistic Inhibitor Compounds.
30266595|a|Numerous proteins can coalesce into amyloid self-assemblies, which are responsible for a class of diseases called amyloidoses, but which can also fulfill important biological functions and are of great interest for biotechnology. Amyloid aggregation is a complex multi-step process, poorly prone to detailed structural studies. Therefore, small molecules interacting with amyloids are often used as tools to probe the amyloid aggregation pathway and in some cases to treat amyloidoses as they prevent pathogenic protein aggregation. Here, we report on SynAggreg, an in vitro high-throughput (HT) platform dedicated to the precision study of amyloid aggregation and the effect of modulator compounds. SynAggreg relies on an accurate bi-fluorescent amyloid-tracer readout that overcomes some limitations of existing HT methods. It allows addressing diverse aspects of aggregation modulation that are critical for pathomechanistic studies, such as the specificity of compounds toward various amyloids and their effects on aggregation kinetics, as well as the co-assembly propensity of distinct amyloids and the influence of prion-like seeding on self-assembly. Furthermore, SynAggreg is the first HT technology that integrates tailored methodology to systematically identify synergistic compound combinations-an emerging strategy to improve fatal amyloidoses by targeting multiple steps of the aggregation pathway. To this end, we apply analytical combinatorial scores to rank the inhibition efficiency of couples of compounds and to readily detect synergism. Finally, the SynAggreg platform should be suited for the characterization of a broad class of amyloids, whether of interest for drug development purposes, for fundamental research on amyloid functions, or for biotechnological applications.

30266683|t|Downregulation of Aquaporin 9 Exacerbates Beta-amyloid-induced Neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's Disease Models In vitro and In vivo.
30266683|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, characterized by progressive cognitive dysfunction. Aquaporin 9 (AQP9) is an aquaglyceroporin membrane channel shown biophysically to conduct water, glycerol, and other small solutes. In our study, we reported for the first time an age-associated decrease in AQP9 mRNA and protein expressions in both hippocampus and cerebral cortex of APPswe/PS1dE9 (Tg) AD mice at 3, 6 and 10 months of age. Consistently, we observed a dose-dependent downregulation of AQP9 expression in PC12 cells after treatment with amyloid-beta protein 1-40 (Abeta1-40). Pre-treatment with AQP9 small interfering RNA led to a more severe neurotoxicity in PC12 cells in response to Abeta1-40. Furthermore, we corroborated that the active participation of AQP9 in AD progression is associated with Abeta-induced apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our results reveal an important role of AQP9 in Abeta-induced pathogenesis of AD which deserves further investigation.

30269259|t|Enhanced Effect of Combining Chlorogenic Acid on Selenium Nanoparticles in Inhibiting Amyloid beta Aggregation and Reactive Oxygen Species Formation In Vitro.
30269259|a|The deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and formation of neurotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a significant pathological signature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Herein, a novel strategy is reported for combining the unique Abeta absorption property of selenium nanoparticles with the natural antioxidant agent chlorogenic acid (CGA) to form CGA@SeNPs. The in vitro biological evaluation revealed that CGA could clear the ROS induced by Abeta40 aggregates, but it did not inhibit the Abeta40 aggregation and cell membrane damage which were also caused by Abeta40 aggregates. Interestingly, CGA@SeNPs show an enhanced inhibition effect on Abeta40 aggregation and, more importantly, protect PC12 cells from Abeta aggregation-induced cell death. It is believed that CGA@SeNPs are more efficient than CGA in reducing Abeta40 toxic in long-term use.

30273553|t|Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapeutics - 1: Repeated clinical failures continue to question the amyloid hypothesis of AD and the current understanding of AD causality.
30273553|a|Deposits of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of aggregated tau in the brain represent key hallmarks of the neurodegenerative disorder, Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and form the basis of the major hypotheses of AD causality. To date, therapeutics that reduce brain amyloid in AD patients have demonstrated no effect in reversing the associated decline in cognition or function indicating that the amyloid hypothesis is either incorrect or that there is a point when the disease becomes independent of Abeta production or is refractory to any type of therapeutic intervention. The clinical failures of inhibitors of tau aggregation, neurotransmitter modulators and drugs repurposed from AD-associated disease indications tend to support this latter viewpoint. Current understanding of AD causality is thus incomplete, a situation that has been compounded by a debate on whether AD is a singularly distinct form of dementia and by the dogmatic promotion of hypotheses over actual clinical data. The latter has repeatedly led to compounds lacking efficacy in Phase II trials being advanced into Phase III where their lack of efficacy is routinely recapitulated. This Commentary, the first of two, discusses amyloid and tau as putative drug targets for AD in the context of the prevalence and economic and social impact of this insidious neurodegenerative disease.

30279351|t|Structural Optimization of Foldamer-Dendrimer Conjugates as Multivalent Agents against the Toxic Effects of Amyloid Beta Oligomers.
30279351|a|Alzheimer's disease is one of the most common chronic neurodegenerative disorders. Despite several in vivo and clinical studies, the cause of the disease is poorly understood. Currently, amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide and its tendency to assemble into soluble oligomers are known as a main pathogenic event leading to the interruption of synapses and brain degeneration. Targeting neurotoxic Abeta oligomers can help recognize the disease at an early stage or it can be a potential therapeutic approach. Unnatural beta-peptidic foldamers are successfully used against many different protein targets due to their favorable structural and pharmacokinetic properties compared to small molecule or protein-like drug candidates. We have previously reported a tetravalent foldamer-dendrimer conjugate which can selectively bind Abeta oligomers. Taking advantage of multivalency and foldamers, we synthesized different multivalent foldamer-based conjugates to optimize the geometry of the ligand. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to measure binding affinity to Abeta, thereafter 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) based tissue viability assay and impedance-based viability assay on SH-SY5Y cells were applied to monitor Abeta toxicity and protective effects of the compounds. Important factors for high binding affinity were determined and a good correlation was found between influencing the valence and the capability of the conjugates for Abeta binding.

30282353|t|Microglia CREB-Phosphorylation Mediates Amyloid-beta-Induced Neuronal Toxicity.
30282353|a|Extracellular accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) forming senile plaques is one of the hallmark pathologies in Alzheimer's disease (AD), while the mechanisms underlying the neuronal toxic effect of Abeta are not fully understood. Here, we found that intracerebroventricular infusion of the aged Abeta42 in mice only induces memory deficit at 24 h but not at 7 days. Interestingly, a remarkably increased CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) Ser133-phosphorylation (pS133-CREB) with microglial activation was detected at 24 h but not at 7 days after Abeta infusion. Abeta treatment for 24 h increased pS133-CREB level in microglia of the hippocampal non-granular cell layers with remarkably decreased pS133-CREB immunoreactivity in neurons of the hippocampal granular cell layers, including CA1, CA3, and DG subsets. Inhibition of microglia activation by minocycline or CREB phosphorylation by H89, an inhibitor of protein kinase A (PKA), abolished Abeta-induced microglia CREB hyperphosphorylation with restoration of neuronal function and attenuation of inflammatory response, i.e., reduced levels of interleukin-6 (IL6) and pCREB binding of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) DNA. Finally, treatment of the primary hippocampal neurons with Abeta-potentiated microglia media decreased neuronal GluN1 and GluA2 levels, while simultaneous inhibition of PKA restored the levels. These novel findings reveal that intracerebroventricular infusion of Abeta only induces transient memory deficit in mice and the molecular mechanisms involve a stimulated microglial CREB phosphorylation.

30282359|t|Brain Amyloid Contribution to Cognitive Dysfunction in Early-Stage Parkinson's Disease: The PPMI Dataset.
30282359|a|BACKGROUND: The pathological processes underlying cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) are heterogeneous and the contribution of cerebral amyloid deposits is poorly defined, particularly in the early stages of the disease. OBJECTIVE: To investigate regional [18F]florbetaben binding to amyloid-beta (Abeta) and its contribution to cognitive dysfunction in early stage PD. METHODS: A multicenter cohort of 48 PD patients from the Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) underwent [18F]florbetaben positron emission tomography (PET) scanning. Clinical features, including demographic characteristics, motor severity, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and cognitive testing were systematically assessed according to the PPMI study protocol. For the purpose of this study, we analyzed various neuropsychological tests assessing all cognitive functions. RESULTS: There were 10/48 (21%) amyloid positive PD patients (PDAbeta+). Increased [18F]florbetaben uptake in widespread cortical and subcortical regions was associated with poorer performance on global cognition, as assessed by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and impaired performance on Symbol Digit Modality test (SDMT). Further, we found that PDAbeta+ patients had higher CSF total-tau/Abeta1 - 42 (p = 0.001) and phosphorylated-tau/Abeta1 - 42 in (p = 0.002) compared to amyloid-negative PD. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that multiple disease processes are associated with PD cognitive impairment and amyloid deposits may be observed already in early stages. However, prevalence of amyloid positivity is in the range of literature age-matched control population. Increased cortical and subcortical amyloid is associated with poor performance in attentive-executive domains while cognitive deficits at MoCA and SDMT may identify amyloid-related dysfunction in early PD.

30285025|t|l-Dopa and dopamine conjugated naphthalenediimides modulate amyloid beta toxicity.
30285025|a|The process of protein misfolding and aggregation to form neurotoxic species is strongly implicated in most of the neurodegenerative disorders. In particular, amyloid beta (Abeta) misfolding and aggregation is central to pathophysiological processes of Alzheimer's disease. The development of aggregation modulators has enormous implications in the discovery of effective therapeutic agents for Alzheimer's disease. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a series of natural amino acid, l-dopa and dopamine appended derivatives of naphthalenediimide (NDI) to identify efficient aggregation modulators. Furthermore, the molecular docking studies revealed the possible binding sites and binding mode of NDI-conjugates to Abeta aggregates. Among the designed NDI-conjugates, l-dopa and dopamine derivatives (NLD and NDP, respectively) showed excellent aggregation modulation efficiency (inhibition and dissolution), as shown by the thioflavin T (ThT) binding assays, dot blot analysis and in cellulo studies. The docking results from in silico studies are in good agreement with the experimental data. In addition to their significant modulation efficiency towards Abeta aggregation, NLD and NDP possess antioxidant activity conducive to the development of disease-modifying therapeutic agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

30286791|t|Deep proteomic network analysis of Alzheimer's disease brain reveals alterations in RNA binding proteins and RNA splicing associated with disease.
30286791|a|BACKGROUND: The complicated cellular and biochemical changes that occur in brain during Alzheimer's disease are poorly understood. In a previous study we used an unbiased label-free quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomic approach to analyze these changes at a systems level in post-mortem cortical tissue from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AsymAD), and controls. We found modules of co-expressed proteins that correlated with AD phenotypes, some of which were enriched in proteins identified as risk factors for AD by genetic studies. METHODS: The amount of information that can be obtained from such systems-level proteomic analyses is critically dependent upon the number of proteins that can be quantified across a cohort. We report here a new proteomic systems-level analysis of AD brain based on 6,533 proteins measured across AD, AsymAD, and controls using an analysis pipeline consisting of isobaric tandem mass tag (TMT) mass spectrometry and offline prefractionation. RESULTS: Our new TMT pipeline allowed us to more than double the depth of brain proteome coverage. This increased depth of coverage greatly expanded the brain protein network to reveal new protein modules that correlated with disease and were unrelated to those identified in our previous network. Differential protein abundance analysis identified 350 proteins that had altered levels between AsymAD and AD not caused by changes in specific cell type abundance, potentially reflecting biochemical changes that are associated with cognitive decline in AD. RNA binding proteins emerged as a class of proteins altered between AsymAD and AD, and were enriched in network modules that correlated with AD pathology. We developed a proteogenomic approach to investigate RNA splicing events that may be altered by RNA binding protein changes in AD. The increased proteome depth afforded by our TMT pipeline allowed us to identify and quantify a large number of alternatively spliced protein isoforms in brain, including AD risk factors such as BIN1, PICALM, PTK2B, and FERMT2. Many of the new AD protein network modules were enriched in alternatively spliced proteins and correlated with molecular markers of AD pathology and cognition. CONCLUSIONS: Further analysis of the AD brain proteome will continue to yield new insights into the biological basis of AD.

30287345|t|Coconut oil decreases expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and secretion of amyloid peptides through inhibition of ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1).
30287345|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), affecting 5.3 million people in the U.S., impairs portions of the brain controlling memories. In humans, mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene has been implicated in increased plaque formation, which can block the communication between nerve cells, decrease dendritic formation and increase cell death, and promote neuroinflammation. As coconut oil has been suggested to alleviate the symptoms in AD patients, we examined the impact of coconut oil on APP expression and secretion of amyloid peptides in N2a cells expressing the human APP gene (N2a/APP695). We found that coconut oil treatment decreased APP expression in N2a cells and reduced the secretion of amyloid peptides Abeta40 and Abeta42. Moreover, coconut oil treatment promoted differentiation of N2a cells. Our data suggest that ADP-Ribosylation Factor 1 (ARF1) may contribute to the effects of coconut oil on APP expression and secretion of Abeta. A high ARF1 expression was also detected in the primary neuronal cells from the mice overexpressing the Swedish mutant APP. Immunostaining results revealed that APP is co-localized with ARF1 in the Golgi apparatus and this interaction is impaired after coconut oil treatment. Furthermore, knockdown of ARF-1 using siRNA decreased secretion of amyloid peptides, confirming the impact of ARF1 on the secretion of amyloid peptides. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that coconut oil decreases intracellular ARF1 expression, thereby resulting in an inhibition of APP and amyloid beta secretion. This study reveals a novel mechanism for intracellular APP processing in neuronal cells.

30290270|t|Single-copy expression of an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-linked TDP-43 mutation (M337V) in BAC transgenic mice leads to altered stress granule dynamics and progressive motor dysfunction.
30290270|a|Mutations in the gene encoding the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), clinically and pathologically indistinguishable from the majority of 'sporadic' cases of ALS, establishing altered TDP-43 function and distribution as a primary mechanism of neurodegeneration. Transgenic mouse models in which TDP-43 is overexpressed only partially recapitulate the key cellular pathology of human ALS, but may also lead to non-specific toxicity. To avoid the potentially confounding effects of overexpression, and to maintain regulated spatio-temporal and cell-specific expression, we generated mice in which an 80 kb genomic fragment containing the intact human TDP-43 locus (either TDP-43WT or TDP-43M337V) and its regulatory regions was integrated into the Rosa26 (Gt(ROSA26)Sor) locus in a single copy. At 3 months of age, TDP-43M337V mice are phenotypically normal but by around 6 months develop progressive motor function deficits associated with loss of neuromuscular junction integrity, leading to a reduced lifespan. RNA sequencing shows that widespread mis-splicing is absent prior to the development of a motor phenotype, though differential expression analysis reveals a distinct transcriptional profile in pre-symptomatic TDP-43M337V spinal cords. Despite the presence of clear motor abnormalities, there was no evidence of TDP-43 cytoplasmic aggregation in vivo at any timepoint. In primary embryonic spinal motor neurons and in embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived motor neurons, mutant TDP-43 undergoes cytoplasmic mislocalisation, and is associated with altered stress granule assembly and dynamics. Overall, this mouse model provides evidence that ALS may arise through acquired TDP-43 toxicity associated with defective stress granule function. The normal phenotype until 6 months of age can facilitate the study of early pathways underlying ALS.

30292090|t|CSF pro-orexin and amyloid-beta38 expression in Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia.
30292090|a|There is an unmet need for markers that can stratify different forms and subtypes of dementia. Because of similarities in clinical presentation, it can be difficult to distinguish between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Using a multiplex targeted proteomic LC-MS/MS platform, we aimed to identify cerebrospinal fluid proteins differentially expressed between patients with AD and FTD. Furthermore analysis of 2 confirmed FTD genetic subtypes carrying progranulin (GRN) and chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) mutations was performed to give an insight into the differing pathologies of these forms of FTD. Patients with AD (n = 13) demonstrated a significant (p < 0.007) 1.24-fold increase in pro-orexin compared to FTD (n = 32). Amyloid beta-38 levels in patients with AD were unaltered but demonstrated a >2-fold reduction (p < 0.0001) in the FTD group compared to controls and a similar 1.83-fold reduction compared to the AD group (p < 0.001). Soluble TREM2 was elevated in both dementia groups but did not show any difference between AD and FTD. A further analysis comparing FTD subgroups revealed slightly lower levels of proteins apolipoprotein E, CD166, osteopontin, transthyretin, and cystatin C in the GRN group (n = 9) compared to the C9orf72 group (n = 7). These proteins imply GRN FTD elicits an altered inflammatory response to C9orf72 FTD.

30293574|t|N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated calcium influx connects amyloid-beta oligomers to ectopic neuronal cell cycle reentry in Alzheimer's disease.
30293574|a|INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) symptoms reflect synaptic dysfunction and neuron death. Amyloid-beta oligomers (AbetaOs) induce excess calcium entry into neurons via N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), contributing to synaptic dysfunction. The study described here tested the hypothesis that AbetaO-stimulated calcium entry also drives neuronal cell cycle reentry (CCR), a prelude to neuron death in AD. METHODS: Pharmacologic modulators of calcium entry and gene expression knockdown were used in cultured neurons and AD model mice. RESULTS: In cultured neurons, AbetaO-stimulated CCR was blocked by NMDAR antagonists, total calcium chelation with 1,2-Bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester) (BAPTA-AM), or knockdown of the NMDAR subunit, NR1. NMDAR antagonists also blocked the activation of calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and treatment of Tg2576 AD model mice with the NMDAR antagonist, memantine, prevented CCR. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates a role for AbetaO-stimulated calcium influx via NMDAR and CCR in AD and suggests the use of memantine as a disease-modifying therapy for presymptomatic AD.

30295351|t|Clusterin contributes to early stage of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.
30295351|a|While clusterin is reportedly involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, how clusterin interacts with amyloid-beta (Ass) to cause Ass neurotoxicity remains unclear in vivo. Using 5xFAD transgenic mice, which develop robust AD pathology and memory deficits when very young, we detected interactions between clusterin and Ass in the mouse brains. The two proteins were concurrently upregulated and bound or colocalized with each other in the same complexes or in amyloid plaques. Neuropathology and cognitive performance were assessed in the progeny of clusterin-null mice crossed with 5xFAD mice, yielding clu-/- ;5xFAD and clu+/+ ;5xFAD. We found far less of the various pools of Ass proteins, most strikingly soluble Ass oligomers and amyloid plaques in clu-/- ;5xFAD mice at 5 months of age. At that age, those mice also had higher levels of neuronal and synaptic proteins and better motor coordination, spatial learning and memory than age-matched clu+/+ ;5xFAD mice. However, at 10 months of age, these differences disappeared, with Ass and plaque deposition, neuronal and synaptic proteins and impairment of behavioral and cognitive performance similar in both groups. These findings demonstrate that clusterin is necessarily involved in early stages of AD pathogenesis by enhancing toxic Ass pools to cause Ass-directed neurodegeneration and behavioral and cognitive impairments, but not in late stage.

30295993|t|A comparative study of resveratrol and resveratrol-functional selenium nanoparticles: Inhibiting amyloid beta aggregation and reactive oxygen species formation properties.
30295993|a|Deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregates and formation of neurotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) are significant pathological signatures of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Resveratrol (Res) is an antioxidant with the potential to treat AD. However, the bioavailability and solubility of Res is very low and it cannot entirely inhibit Cu2+ -induced Abeta42 aggregation at low concentration. Herein, we combine the unique Abeta absorption property of selenium nanoparticles with the natural antioxidant agent Res to form Res@SeNPs. Our in vitro biological evaluation revealed that modification of Res with SeNPs provides a synergistic effect on Cu2+ -induced Abeta42 aggregation, ROS generation and, more importantly, protects PC12 cells from Abeta42-Cu2+ complexes-induced cell death. It is believed that SeNPs can improve the application of Res in AD treatment as Res@SeNPs is more efficient than Res in reducing Abeta42 toxicity in long-term use.   2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

30297968|t|Integrative transcriptome analyses of the aging brain implicate altered splicing in Alzheimer's disease susceptibility.
30297968|a|Here we use deep sequencing to identify sources of variation in mRNA splicing in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of 450 subjects from two aging cohorts. Hundreds of aberrant pre-mRNA splicing events are reproducibly associated with Alzheimer's disease. We also generate a catalog of splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTL) effects: splicing of 3,006 genes is influenced by genetic variation. We report that altered splicing is the mechanism for the effects of the PICALM, CLU and PTK2B susceptibility alleles. Furthermore, we performed a transcriptome-wide association study and identified 21 genes with significant associations with Alzheimer's disease, many of which are found in known loci, whereas 8 are in novel loci. These results highlight the convergence of old and new genes associated with Alzheimer's disease in autophagy-lysosomal-related pathways. Overall, this study of the transcriptome of the aging brain provides evidence that dysregulation of mRNA splicing is a feature of Alzheimer's disease and is, in some cases, genetically driven.

The most critical species affected is insulin, which is produced by the beta-cells of the islets, but there are a number of other species copackaged and cosecreted within the insulin granules. This includes zinc, which exists in high (millimolar) concentrations within the beta-cells, and islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), which is an amyloid peptide thought to induce beta-cell apoptosis through self-association into toxic amyloid oligomers. Zinc is essential in the packaging of crystalline insulin within the vesicles but it can also bind and interact with IAPP. This implies a complex relationship between all three species and diabetes, particularly in the structure and function of toxic IAPP aggregates. Atypical (low or high) concentrations of zinc generally appear to correlate with increased hIAPP aggregation, whereas physiological zinc concentrations have an inhibitory effect. To better understand how zinc ions alter the monomer and oligomer structure of hIAPP in vitro, we employ a combination of ion mobility mass spectrometry and atomic force microscopy. We observe an increase in the extended beta-hairpin conformation of hIAPP when it is bound to zinc. With sufficiently low concentrations of zinc this could result in an association site for zinc-free hIAPP, promoting amyloid aggregation. At high zinc concentrations, we see the appearance of a secondary zinc association site whose coordination could account for the loss of inhibition at high zinc concentrations. Generally, it appears that zinc preferentially stabilizes the beta-hairpin conformation of hIAPP and the population of zinc-bound hIAPP in solution determines what effect this has on amyloid aggregation.

30300695|t|Fucosterol exerts protection against amyloid beta-induced neurotoxicity, reduces intracellular levels of amyloid beta and enhances the mRNA expression of neuroglobin in amyloid beta-induced SH-SY5Y cells.
30300695|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that leads to progressive loss of neurons which often results in deterioration of memory and cognitive function. The development of AD is highly associated with the formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Amyloid beta (Abeta) induces neurotoxicity and contributes to the development of AD. Recent evidences also highlighted the importance of neuroglobin (Ngb) in ameliorating AD. This study assessed the ability of fucosterol, a phytosterol found in brown alga, in protecting SH-SY5Y cells against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. Its effects on the mRNA levels of APP and Ngb as well as the intracellular Abeta levels were also determined in Abeta-induced SH-SY5Y cells. SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to fucosterol prior to Abeta treatment. The effect on apoptosis was determined using Annexin V FITC staining and mRNA expression was studied using RT-PCR. Flow cytometry confirmed the protective effects of fucosterol on SH-SY5Y cells against Abeta-induced apoptosis. Pretreatment with fucosterol increased the Ngb mRNA levels but reduced the levels of APP mRNA and intracellular Abeta in Abeta-induced SH-SY5Y cells. These observations demonstrated the protective properties of fucosterol against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity in neuronal cells.

30300753|t|High detection sensitivity with antibody-based PET radioligand for amyloid beta in brain.
30300753|a|PET imaging of amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposits in brain has become an important aid in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, and an inclusion criterion for patient enrolment into clinical trials of new anti-Abeta treatments. Available PET radioligands visualizing Abeta bind to insoluble fibrils, i.e. Abeta plaques. Levels of prefibrillar Abeta forms, e.g. soluble oligomers and protofibrils, correlate better than plaques with disease severity and these soluble species are the neurotoxic form of Abeta leading to neurodegeneration. The goal was to create an antibody-based radioligand, recognizing not only fibrillary Abeta, but also smaller and still soluble aggregates. We designed and expressed a small recombinant bispecific antibody construct, di-scFv 3D6-8D3, targeting the Abeta N-terminus and the transferrin receptor (TfR). Natively expressed at the blood-brain barrier (BBB), TfR could thus be used as a brain-blood shuttle. Di-scFv 3D6-8D3 bound to Abeta1-40 with high affinity and to TfR with moderate affinity. Di-scFv [124I]3D6-8D3 was injected in two transgenic mouse models overexpressing human Abeta and wild-type control mice and PET scanned at 14, 24 or 72 h after injection. Di-scFv [124I]3D6-8D3 was retained in brain of transgenic animals while it was cleared from wild-type lacking Abeta. This difference was observed from 24 h onwards, and at 72 h, 18 months old transgenic animals, with high load of Abeta pathology, displayed SUVR of 2.2-3.5 in brain while wild-type showed ratios close to unity. A subset of the mice were also scanned with [11C]PIB. Again wt mice displayed ratios of unity while transgenes showed slightly, non-significantly, elevated SUVR of 1.2, indicating improved sensitivity with novel di-scFv [124I]3D6-8D3 compared with [11C]PIB. Brain concentrations of di-scFv [124I]3D6-8D3 correlated with soluble Abeta (p < 0.0001) but not with total Abeta, i.e. plaque load (p = 0.34). We have successfully created a small bispecific antibody-based radioligand capable of crossing the BBB, subsequently binding to and visualizing intrabrain Abeta in vivo. The radioligand displayed better sensitivity compared with [11C]PIB, and brain concentrations correlated with soluble neurotoxic Abeta aggregates.

30302613|t|Trans-cinnamaldehyde Modulates Hippocampal Nrf2 Factor and Inhibits Amyloid Beta Aggregation in LPS-Induced Neuroinflammation Mouse Model.
30302613|a|Trans-cinnamaldehyde (CNM) has recently drawn attention due to its potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The current study explored the memory enhancing effects of CNM against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation in mice. CNM and curcumin (a reference antioxidant) were administered at a dose of 50 mg/kg i.p. 3 h after a single LPS injection (0.8 mg/kg, i.p.) and continued daily for 7 days. Our results displayed that CNM and curcumin significantly ameliorated the LPS-induced impairment of learning and memory, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis. Memory functions and locomotor activity were assessed by Morris water maze, object recognition test and open field test. Both CNM and curcumin activated the nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) and restored levels of downstream antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in the hippocampus. They also attenuated LPS-induced increase in hippocampal contents of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), malondialdehyde and caspase-3. Immunohistochemistry results showed that both CNM and curcumin reduced Abeta1-42 protein accumulation in brain of mice. Remarkably CNM's effect on IL-1beta was less pronounced than curcumin; however it showed higher GST activity and more potent anti-apoptotic and anti-amylodogenic effect. We conclude that, CNM produces its memory enhancing effects through modulation of Nrf2 antioxidant defense in hippocampus, inhibition of neuroinflammation, apoptosis and amyloid protein burden.

30305451|t|Regional amyloid accumulation and cognitive decline in initially amyloid-negative adults.
30305451|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess whether global or regional changes in amyloid burden over 4 years predict early declines in episodic memory in initially amyloid-negative adults. METHODS: One hundred twenty-six initially amyloid-negative, cognitively normal participants (age 30-89 years) were included from the Dallas Lifespan Brain Study who completed florbetapir PET and a cognitive battery at baseline and 4-year follow-up. Standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) change was computed across 8 bilateral regions of interest. Using general linear models, we examined the relationship between change in global and regional SUVR and change in episodic memory, controlling for baseline SUVR, baseline memory, age, sex, education, and APOE status. RESULTS: In initially amyloid-negative adults, we detected a regionally specific relationship between declining episodic memory and increasing amyloid accumulation across multiple posterior cortical regions. In addition, these amyloid-related changes in memory persisted when we focused on middle-aged adults only and after controlling for atrophy in global cortical, hippocampal, and Alzheimer disease signature cortical volume. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that assessing regional changes in amyloid, particularly in posterior cortical regions, can aid in the early detection of subclinical amyloid-related decline in episodic memory as early as middle age. Future research incorporating tau and other markers of neurodegeneration is needed to clarify the sequence of events that lead to this early, subclinical memory decline.

30309389|t|Safety, tolerability and efficacy of the glutaminyl cyclase inhibitor PQ912 in Alzheimer's disease: results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2a study.
30309389|a|BACKGROUND: PQ912 is an inhibitor of the glutaminyl cyclase enzyme that plays a central role in the formation of synaptotoxic pyroglutamate-A-beta oligomers. We report on the first clinical study with PQ912 in subjects with biomarker-proven Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim was to determine the maximal tolerated dose, target occupancy and treatment-related pharmacodynamic effects. The exploratory efficacy readouts selected were tailored to the patient population with early AD. The therapeutic approach focuses on synaptic dysfunction as captured by various measures such as electroencephalography (EEG), synaptic biomarkers and sensitive cognitive tests. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of PQ912 800 mg twice daily (bid) for 12 weeks in subjects with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to AD. The 120 enrolled subjects were treatment-naive at the start of the study, had confirmed AD biomarkers in their cerebrospinal fluid at screening and had a Mini Mental State Examination score between 21 and 30. After 1 week of treatment with 400 mg bid, patients were up-titrated to 800 mg bid for 11 weeks. Patients were randomized 1:1 to either PQ912 or placebo. The primary composite endpoints were to assess safety and tolerability based on the number of patients who discontinued due to (serious) adverse events (safety), and based on dose adjustment during the treatment period and/or nonadherence to randomized treatment (tolerability). All randomized subjects who took at least one dose of the study treatment or placebo were used for safety analyses. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between treatments in the number of subjects with (serious) adverse events, although there were slightly more patients with a serious adverse event in the PQ912 group compared to placebo. More subjects treated with PQ912 discontinued treatment due to adverse events, mostly related to gastrointestinal and skin/subcutaneous tissue disorders. PQ912 treatment resulted in a significant reduction in glutaminyl cyclase activity, which resulted in an average target occupancy of > 90%. A significant reduction of theta power in the EEG frequency analysis and a significant improvement in the One Back test of our Neuropsychological Test Battery was observed. The exploratory biomarker readouts, neurogranin for synaptic toxicity and YKL-40 as a marker of inflammation, appear to be sensitive enough to serve as efficacy markers in the next phase 2b study. CONCLUSIONS: The maximal tolerated dose of PQ912 has been identified and the results support future studies at still lower doses reaching > 50% target occupancy, a longer up-titration phase to potentially induce adaptation and longer treatment periods to confirm the early signals of efficacy as seen in this study.

30310141|t|Patient-derived frontotemporal lobar degeneration brain extracts induce formation and spreading of TDP-43 pathology in vivo.
30310141|a|The stereotypical distribution of TAR DNA-binding 43 protein (TDP-43) aggregates in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-TDP) suggests that pathological TDP-43 spreads throughout the brain via cell-to-cell transmission and correlates with disease progression, but no in vivo experimental data support this hypothesis. We first develop a doxycycline-inducible cell line expressing GFP-tagged cytoplasmic TDP-43 protein (iGFP-NLSm) as a cell-based system to screen and identify seeding activity of human brain-derived pathological TDP-43 isolated from sporadic FTLD-TDP and familial cases with Granulin (FTLD-TDP-GRN) or C9orf72 repeat expansion mutations (FTLD-TDP-C9+). We demonstrate that intracerebral injections of biologically active pathogenic FTLD-TDP seeds into transgenic mice expressing cytoplasmic human TDP-43 (lines CamKIIa-hTDP-43NLSm, rNLS8, and CamKIIa-208) and non-transgenic mice led to the induction of de-novo TDP-43 pathology. Moreover, TDP-43 pathology progressively spreads throughout the brain in a time-dependent manner via the neuroanatomic connectome. Our study suggests that the progression of FTLD-TDP reflects the templated cell-to-cell transneuronal spread of pathological TDP-43.

30311215|t|The effects of fluorescent labels on Abeta42 aggregation detected by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy.
30311215|a|Fluorescence-based methods are promising for measuring amyloid beta (Abeta) oligomers, given their capacity to analyse a sample at the single-molecule level. As the attachment of fluorescent labels may influence the biochemical properties of the Abeta oligomers, the effects of fluorescent labels on Abeta oligomers must be evaluated. In this paper, we compared the impacts of five different fluorescent dyes on the aggregation of Abeta42 oligomers using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). We found that fluorescent labels of BODIPY  FL-C5 (BP), N-hydroxysuccinimide rhodamine B ester (RB) and rhodamine B isothiocyanate (RITC) increased the propensity of labelled Abeta42 oligomers to aggregate, whereas 6-(fluorescein-5-carboxamido) hexanoic acid succinimidyl ester (5-SFX) and fluorescein 5(6)-isothiocyanate (5(6)-FITC) decreased the propensity of labelled Abeta42 oligomers to aggregate. This difference originated from the different electric charges and hydrophobicity of the fluorescent dyes. These results provide valuable information for establishing different aggregation models for Abeta42 oligomers in vitro using FCS.

30311654|t|Whole brain imaging reveals distinct spatial patterns of amyloid beta deposition in three mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.
30311654|a|A variety of Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse models overexpress mutant forms of human amyloid precursor protein (APP), producing high levels of amyloid beta (Abeta) and forming plaques. However, the degree to which these models mimic spatiotemporal patterns of Abeta deposition in brains of AD patients is unknown. Here, we mapped the spatial distribution of Abeta plaques across age in three APP-overexpression mouse lines (APP/PS1, Tg2576, and hAPP-J20) using in vivo labeling with methoxy-X04, high throughput whole brain imaging, and an automated informatics pipeline. Images were acquired with high resolution serial two-photon tomography and labeled plaques were detected using custom-built segmentation algorithms. Image series were registered to the Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework, a 3D reference atlas, enabling automated brain-wide quantification of plaque density, number, and location. In both APP/PS1 and Tg2576 mice, plaques were identified first in isocortex, followed by olfactory, hippocampal, and cortical subplate areas. In hAPP-J20 mice, plaque density was highest in hippocampal areas, followed by isocortex, with little to no involvement of olfactory or cortical subplate areas. Within the major brain divisions, distinct regions were identified with high (or low) plaque accumulation; for example, the lateral visual area within the isocortex of APP/PS1 mice had relatively higher plaque density compared with other cortical areas, while in hAPP-J20 mice, plaques were densest in the ventral retrosplenial cortex. In summary, we show how whole brain imaging of amyloid pathology in mice reveals the extent to which a given model recapitulates the regional Abeta deposition patterns described in AD.

30315145|t|Assessing Amyloid Pathology in Cognitively Normal Subjects Using 18F-Flutemetamol PET: Comparing Visual Reads and Quantitative Methods.
30315145|a|Our objective was to determine the optimal approach for assessing amyloid disease in a cognitively normal elderly population. Methods: Dynamic 18F-flutemetamol PET scans were acquired using a coffee-break protocol (a 0- to 30-min scan and a 90- to 110-min scan) on 190 cognitively normal elderly individuals (mean age, 70.4 y; 60% female). Parametric images were generated from SUV ratio (SUVr) and nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) methods, with cerebellar gray matter as a reference region, and were visually assessed by 3 trained readers. Interreader agreement was calculated using kappa-statistics, and semiquantitative values were obtained. Global cutoffs were calculated for both SUVr and BPND using a receiver-operating-characteristic analysis and the Youden index. Visual assessment was related to semiquantitative classifications. Results: Interreader agreement in visual assessment was moderate for SUVr (kappa = 0.57) and good for BPND images (kappa = 0.77). There was discordance between readers for 35 cases (18%) using SUVr and for 15 cases (8%) using BPND, with 9 overlapping cases. For the total cohort, the mean (+-SD) SUVr and BPND were 1.33 (+-0.21) and 0.16 (+-0.12), respectively. Most of the 35 cases (91%) for which SUVr image assessment was discordant between readers were classified as negative based on semiquantitative measurements. Conclusion: The use of parametric BPND images for visual assessment of 18F-flutemetamol in a population with low amyloid burden improves interreader agreement. Implementing semiquantification in addition to visual assessment of SUVr images can reduce false-positive classification in this population.

30320570|t|Dipeptidyl-Peptidase Activity of Meprin beta Links N-truncation of Abeta with Glutaminyl Cyclase-Catalyzed pGlu-Abeta Formation.
30320570|a|The formation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides is causally involved in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A significant proportion of deposited Abeta is N-terminally truncated and modified at the N-terminus by a pGlu-residue (pGlu-Abeta). These forms show enhanced neurotoxicity compared to full-length Abeta. Although the truncation may occur by aminopeptidases after formation of Abeta, recently discovered processing pathways of amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) by proteases such as meprin beta may also be involved. Here, we assessed a role of meprin beta in forming Abeta3-40/42, which is the precursor of pGlu-Abeta3-40/42 generated by glutaminyl cyclase (QC). Similar to QC, meprin beta mRNA is significantly upregulated in postmortem brain from AD patients. A histochemical analysis supports the presence of meprin beta in neurons and astrocytes in the vicinity of pGlu-Abeta containing deposits. Cleavage of AbetaPP-derived peptides by meprin beta in vitro results in peptides Abeta1-x, Abeta2-x, and Abeta3-x. The formation of N-truncated Abeta by meprin beta was also corroborated in cell culture. A subset of the generated peptides was converted into pGlu-Abeta3-40 by an addition of glutaminyl cyclase, supporting the preceding formation of Abeta3-40. Further analysis of the meprin beta cleavage revealed a yet unknown dipeptidyl-peptidase-like activity specific for the N-terminus of Abeta1-x. Thus, our data suggest that meprin beta contributes to the formation of N-truncated Abeta by endopeptidase and exopeptidase activity to generate the substrate for QC-catalyzed pGlu-Abeta formation.

30320571|t|A Nomogram for Predicting Amyloid PET Positivity in Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment.
30320571|a|BACKGROUND: Most clinical trials focus on amyloid-beta positive (Abeta+) amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), but screening failures are high because only a half of patients with aMCI are positive on Abeta PET. Therefore, it becomes necessary for clinicians to predict which patients will have Abeta biomarker. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare clinical factors, neuropsychological (NP) profiles, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype between Abeta+ aMCI and Abeta-aMCI and to develop a clinically useful prediction model of Abeta positivity on PET (PET-Abeta+) in aMCI using a nomogram. METHODS: We recruited 523 aMCI patients who underwent Abeta PET imaging in a nation-wide multicenter cohort. The results of NP measures were divided into following subgroups: 1) Stage (Early and Late-stage), 2) Modality (Visual, Verbal, and Both), 3) Recognition failure, and 4) Multiplicity (Single and Multiple). A nomogram for PET-Abeta+ in aMCI patients was constructed using a logistic regression model. RESULTS: PET-Abeta+ had significant associations with NP profiles for several items, including high Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes score (OR 1.47, p = 0.013) and impaired memory modality (impaired both visual and verbal memories compared with visual only, OR 3.25, p = 0.001). Also, presence of APOEe4 (OR 4.14, p < 0.001) was associated with PET-Abeta+. These predictors were applied to develop the nomogram, which showed good prediction performance (C-statistics = 0.79). Its prediction performances were 0.77/0.74 in internal/external validation. CONCLUSIONS: The nomogram consisting of NP profiles, especially memory domain, and APOEe4 genotype may provide a useful predictive model of PET-Abeta+ in patients with aMCI.

30320580|t|Quantitative Genetics Validates Previous Genetic Variants and Identifies Novel Genetic Players Influencing Alzheimer's Disease Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers.
30320580|a|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers have been extensively investigated in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) field, and are now being applied in clinical practice. CSF amyloid-beta (Abeta1-42), total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) reflect disease pathology, and may be used as quantitative traits for genetic analyses, fostering the identification of new genetic factors and the proposal of novel biological pathways of the disease. In patients, the concentration of CSF Abeta1-42 is decreased due to the accumulation of Abeta1-42 in amyloid plaques in the brain, while t-tau and p-tau levels are increased, indicating the extent of neuronal damage. To better understand the biological mechanisms underlying the regulation of AD biomarkers, and its relation to AD, we examined the association between 36 selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and AD biomarkers Abeta1-42, t-tau, and p-tau in CSF in a cohort of 672 samples (571 AD patients and 101 controls) collected within 10 European consortium centers.Our results highlighted five genes, APOE, LOC100129500, PVRL2, SNAR-I, and TOMM40, previously described as main players in the regulation of CSF biomarkers levels, further reinforcing a role for these in AD pathogenesis. Three new AD susceptibility loci, INPP5D, CD2AP, and CASS4, showed specific association with CSF tau biomarkers. The identification of genes that specifically influence tau biomarkers point out to mechanisms, independent of amyloid processing, but in turn related to tau biology that may open new venues to be explored for AD treatment.

30320590|t|Alzheimer's Disease Biomarkers Have Distinct Associations with Specific Hippocampal Subfield Volumes.
30320590|a|Measures of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid are extensively used for diagnostic and research purposes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) as correlates of cortical thinning and cognitive outcomes. The present study investigated the relationship of Abeta and p-tau with hippocampal subfield volumes Cornu Ammonis (CA) 1-4, dentate gyrus (DG), and subiculum. Subfields were segmented from T1-weighted images from the ADNI-population using FreeSurfer v6. Linear and polynomial regression models revealed distinct associations of Abeta and p-tau with subfield volumes. Abeta had a quadratic relationship with all hippocampal subfield volumes and the inflection point was higher than the validated cut-off for Abeta. For p-tau the relationships were linear, except for CA3, in which it was quadratic. For the CA1 and CA3, these quadratic relationships with Abeta were only observed when p-tau was low. Amyloid and p-tau contributed equally to the explained variance in CA4 and DG volume. Subicular volume was best explained by Abeta alone. These biomarker relationships with hippocampal subfield volumes seem to mirror the hippocampal-specific topography of Abeta and tau reported in neuropathological staging models. In addition, using continuous values of Abeta reveals positive patterns with imaging markers for individuals around the positivity threshold that would be masked when using dichotomized biomarker groups, which can be important for early detection and accurate inclusion of potential participants at risk for AD in clinical trials.

30323170|t|Uncovering the heterogeneity and temporal complexity of neurodegenerative diseases with Subtype and Stage Inference.
30323170|a|The heterogeneity of neurodegenerative diseases is a key confound to disease understanding and treatment development, as study cohorts typically include multiple phenotypes on distinct disease trajectories. Here we introduce a machine-learning technique-Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn)-able to uncover data-driven disease phenotypes with distinct temporal progression patterns, from widely available cross-sectional patient studies. Results from imaging studies in two neurodegenerative diseases reveal subgroups and their distinct trajectories of regional neurodegeneration. In genetic frontotemporal dementia, SuStaIn identifies genotypes from imaging alone, validating its ability to identify subtypes; further the technique reveals within-genotype heterogeneity. In Alzheimer's disease, SuStaIn uncovers three subtypes, uniquely characterising their temporal complexity. SuStaIn provides fine-grained patient stratification, which substantially enhances the ability to predict conversion between diagnostic categories over standard models that ignore subtype (p = 7.18 x 10-4) or temporal stage (p = 3.96 x 10-5). SuStaIn offers new promise for enabling disease subtype discovery and precision medicine.

30323343|t|Fibrin-targeting immunotherapy protects against neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.
30323343|a|Activation of innate immunity and deposition of blood-derived fibrin in the central nervous system (CNS) occur in autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanisms that link disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to neurodegeneration are poorly understood, and exploration of fibrin as a therapeutic target has been limited by its beneficial clotting functions. Here we report the generation of monoclonal antibody 5B8, targeted against the cryptic fibrin epitope gamma377-395, to selectively inhibit fibrin-induced inflammation and oxidative stress without interfering with clotting. 5B8 suppressed fibrin-induced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activation and the expression of proinflammatory genes. In animal models of MS and AD, 5B8 entered the CNS and bound to parenchymal fibrin, and its therapeutic administration reduced the activation of innate immunity and neurodegeneration. Thus, fibrin-targeting immunotherapy inhibited autoimmunity- and amyloid-driven neurotoxicity and might have clinical benefit without globally suppressing innate immunity or interfering with coagulation in diverse neurological diseases.

30326219|t|3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione protects PC12 cells against amyloid beta 1-42 (Abeta1-42) induced apoptosis via activation of the ERK1/2 pathway.
30326219|a|AIMS: Increasing evidence displays that deposition of aggregated beta-amyloid (Abeta) leads to neuronal cell apoptosis, thus aggravates the pathological progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione (D3T) has been proved to exert neuroprotective effects. However, the effect of D3T on protecting against Abeta-induced apoptosis and the underlying mechanism are unknown. MAIN METHODS: MTT, DCFH-DA assay, LDH release assay, Fluo-3 AM assay, Flow cytometry and Western blot were used to examine cell viability, ROS level, LDH release, intracellular Ca2+ concentration, cell apoptosis and related proteins level respectively. KEY FINDINGS: In the present study, we found that D3T pretreatment significantly increased cell viability and decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and the intracellular calcium concentration of rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells after Abeta1-42 exposure. In addition, D3T pretreatment inhibited Abeta1-42 induced cell apoptosis as well as protein levels of Bax and Caspase-3 in PC12 cells. Further, D3T markedly activated extracellular regulated protein kinase 1/2 (p-ERK1/2) but not PI3K/Akt signaling. Moreover, the protective effect of D3T against Abeta1-42 induced apoptosis was abolished by the ERK1/2 pathway inhibitor PD98059 while PI3K inhibitor LY294002 had no significant effect. SIGNIFICANCE: Taken together, these findings suggest that D3T protects PC12 cells against Abeta1-42 induced apoptosis through activation of the ERK1/2 pathway.

30332835|a|Gx-50 is a bioactive compound for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) found in Sichuan pepper (Zanthoxylum bungeanum). In order to find a stronger anti-AD lead compound, 20 gx-50 (1-20) analogs have been designed and synthesized, and their molecular structures were determined based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, as well as comparison with literature data. Compounds 1-20 were evaluated for their anti-AD potential by using DPPH radical scavenging assay for considering their anti-oxidant activity, thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence assay for considering the inhibitory or disaggregate potency of Abeta, and transgenic Drosophila model assay for evaluating their rescue effect on memory loss. Finally, compound 13 was determined as a promising anti-AD candidate.

30335383|t|Amyloid Fibril Design: Limiting Structural Polymorphism in Alzheimer's Abeta Protofilaments.
30335383|a|Nanoscale fibrils formed by amyloid peptides have a polymorphic character, adopting several types of molecular structures in similar growth conditions. As shown by experimental (e.g., solid-state NMR) and computational studies, amyloid fibril polymorphism hinders both the structural characterization of Alzheimer's Abeta amyloid protofilaments and fibrils at a molecular level, as well as the possible applications (e.g., development of drugs or biomarkers) that rely on similar, controlled molecular arrangements of the Abeta peptides in amyloid fibril structures. We have explored the use of several contact potentials for the efficient identification of minimal sequence mutations that could enhance the stability of specific fibril structures while simultaneously destabilizing competing topologies, controlling thus the amount of structural polymorphism in a rational way. We found that different types of contact potentials, while having only partial accuracy on their own, lead to similar results regarding ranking the compatibility of wild-type (WT) and mutated amyloid sequences with different fibril morphologies. This approach allows exhaustive screening and assessment of possible mutations and the identification of minimal consensus mutations that could stabilize fibrils with the desired topology at the expense of other topology types, a prediction that is further validated using atomistic molecular dynamics with explicit water molecules. We apply this two-step multiscale (i.e., residue and atomistic-level) approach to predict and validate mutations that could bias either parallel or antiparallel packing in the core Alzheimer's Abeta9-40 amyloid fibril models based on solid-state NMR experiments. Besides shedding new light on the molecular origins of structural polymorphism in WT Abeta fibrils, our study could also lead to efficient tools for assisting future experimental approaches for amyloid fibril determination, and for the development of biomarkers or drugs aimed at interfering with the stability of amyloid fibrils, as well as for the future design of amyloid fibrils with a controlled (e.g., reduced) level of structural polymorphism.

30336198|t|Distinct cytokine profiles in human brains resilient to Alzheimer's pathology.
30336198|a|Our group has previously studied the brains of some unique individuals who are able to tolerate robust amounts of Alzheimer's pathological lesions (amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles) without experiencing dementia while alive. These rare resilient cases do not demonstrate the patterns of neuronal/synaptic loss that are normally found in the brains of typical demented Alzheimer's patients. Moreover, they exhibit decreased astrocyte and microglial activation markers GFAP and CD68, suggesting that a suppressed neuroinflammatory response may be implicated in human brain resilience to Alzheimer's pathology. In the present work, we used a multiplexed immunoassay to profile a panel of 27 cytokines in the brains of controls, typical demented Alzheimer's cases, and two groups of resilient cases, which possessed pathology consistent with either high probability (HP, Braak stage V-VI and CERAD 2-3) or intermediate probability (IP, Braak state III-IV and CERAD 1-3) of Alzheimer's disease in the absence of dementia. We used a multivariate partial least squares regression approach to study differences in cytokine expression between resilient cases and both Alzheimer's and control cases. Our analysis identified distinct profiles of cytokines in the entorhinal cortex (one of the earliest and most severely affected brain regions in Alzheimer's disease) that are up-regulated in both HP and IP resilient cases relative to Alzheimer's and control cases. These cytokines, including IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-13, and IL-4 in HP resilient cases and IL-6, IL-10, and IP-10 in IP resilient cases, delineate differential inflammatory activity in brains resilient to Alzheimer's pathology compared to Alzheimer's cases. Of note, these cytokines all have been associated with pathogen clearance and/or the resolution of inflammation. Moreover, our analysis in the superior temporal sulcus (a multimodal association cortex that consistently accumulates Alzheimer's pathology at later stages of the disease along with overt symptoms of dementia) revealed increased expression of neurotrophic factors, such as PDGF-bb and basic FGF in resilient compared to AD cases. The same region also had reduced expression of chemokines associated with microglial recruitment, including MCP-1 in HP resilient cases and MIP-1alpha in IP resilient cases compared to AD. Altogether, our data suggest that different patterns of cytokine expression exist in the brains of resilient and Alzheimer's cases, link these differences to reduced glial activation, increased neuronal survival and preserved cognition in resilient cases, and reveal specific cytokine targets that may prove relevant to the identification of novel mechanisms of brain resiliency to Alzheimer's pathology.

30336844|t|Recommendations for the nomenclature of cognitive change associated with anaesthesia and surgery-2018.
30336844|a|Cognitive change affecting patients after anaesthesia and surgery has been recognised for more than 100 yr. Research into cognitive change after anaesthesia and surgery accelerated in the 1980s when multiple studies utilised detailed neuropsychological testing for assessment of cognitive change after cardiac surgery. This body of work consistently documented decline in cognitive function in elderly patients after anaesthesia and surgery, and cognitive changes have been identified up to 7.5 yr afterwards. Importantly, other studies have identified that the incidence of cognitive change is similar after non-cardiac surgery. Other than the inclusion of non-surgical control groups to calculate postoperative cognitive dysfunction, research into these cognitive changes in the perioperative period has been undertaken in isolation from cognitive studies in the general population. The aim of this work is to develop similar terminology to that used in cognitive classifications of the general population for use in investigations of cognitive changes after anaesthesia and surgery. A multispecialty working group followed a modified Delphi procedure with no prespecified number of rounds comprised of three face-to-face meetings followed by online editing of draft versions. Two major classification guidelines [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5) and National Institute for Aging and the Alzheimer Association (NIA-AA)] are used outside of anaesthesia and surgery, and may be useful for inclusion of biomarkers in research. For clinical purposes, it is recommended to use the DSM-5 nomenclature. The working group recommends that 'perioperative neurocognitive disorders' be used as an overarching term for cognitive impairment identified in the preoperative or postoperative period. This includes cognitive decline diagnosed before operation (described as neurocognitive disorder); any form of acute event (postoperative delirium) and cognitive decline diagnosed up to 30 days after the procedure (delayed neurocognitive recovery) and up to 12 months (postoperative neurocognitive disorder).

30336980|t|A valine-to-lysine substitution at position 210 induces structural conversion of prion protein into a beta-sheet rich oligomer.
30336980|a|Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative diseases associated with structural conversion of alpha-helical prion protein (PrP) into its beta-sheet rich isoform (PrPSc). Previous genetic analyses have indicated that several amino acid residues involved in the hydrophobic core of PrP (such as V180, F198, and V210) play a critical role in the development of prion diseases. To understand how these hydrophobic residues would contribute to the alpha-to-beta conversion process of PrP, we substituted the V210 residue with bulkier (V210F, V210I, and V210L), smaller (V210A), and charged amino acids (V210K) and characterized its effects. Interestingly, although most of the mutations had little or no effect on the biochemical properties of PrP, the V210K mutation induced structural conversion of PrP into a beta-structure. The beta-inducing effect was prominent and observed even under a physiological condition (i.e., in the absence of denaturant, acidic pH, reducing agent, and high temperature) in contrast to the disease-associated mutations in the PrP gene. We also examined structural features of V210K PrP using guanidine-hydrochloride unfolding, dynamic light scattering, 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonate fluorescence, and electron microscopy, and revealed that V210K PrP assembles into a non-fibrillar beta-rich oligomer. Thus, the alpha-to-beta conversion can be induced by introduction of a charged residue into the hydrophobic core, which provide novel insight into the structural dynamics of PrP.

30338980|t|Porphyrinic Metal-Organic Framework PCN-224 Nanoparticles for Near-Infrared-Induced Attenuation of Aggregation and Neurotoxicity of Alzheimer's Amyloid-beta Peptide.
30338980|a|The aberrant aggregation of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) in the brain has been considered as the major pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's diseases (AD). Inhibition of Abeta aggregation is considered as an attractive therapeutic intervention for alleviating amyloid-associated neurotoxicity. Here, we report the near-infrared light (NIR)-induced suppression of Abeta aggregation and reduction of Abeta-induced cytotoxicity via porphyrinic metal-organic framework (MOF) PCN-224 nanoparticles. PCN-224 nanoparticles are hydrothermally synthesized by coordinating tetra-kis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (TCPP) ligands with zirconium. The PCN-224 nanoparticles show high photo-oxygenation efficiency, good biocompatibility, and high stability. The study reveals that the porphyrinic MOF-based nanoprobe activated by NIR light could successfully inhibit self-assembly of monomeric Abeta into a beta-sheet-rich structure. Furthermore, photoexcited PCN-224 nanoparticles also significantly reduce Abeta-induced cytotoxicity under NIR irradiation.

30339264|t|Effects of Brimonidine on Retinal Pigment Epithelial Cells and Muller Cells Exposed to Amyloid-Beta 1-42 Peptide In Vitro.
30339264|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether brimonidine can prevent cytotoxicity in human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) and Muller (MIO) cells after exposure to amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta42). MATERIALS AND METHODS: An in vitro model of geographic atrophy (GA), which is an end-stage complication of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), simulated with the application of Abeta42 in cell culture. RPE and MIO cells were pretreated with brimonidine for 6 hours, then exposed to 10muM Abeta42 for 24 hours. Several concentrations (one time [1x], two times [2x], and five times [5x]) of brimonidine were used to assess for a dose-related effect. Assays were immediately run following the treatment period. 2',7'-Dichlorofluorescein diacetate was used to assess reactive oxygen species production, the MTT assay was used to assess cell viability, and the JC-1 dye assay was used to assess mitochondrial membrane potential. The main outcome measures were reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, cell viability, and mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) of RPE and MIO cells following the treatment phase. RESULTS: High-dose (5x) brimonidine was capable of reducing ROS production in RPE and MIO cells with exposure to Abeta42. The application of Abeta42 alone did not trigger a rise in ROS production. Brimonidine was unable to rescue cell viability and DeltaPsim after exposure to Abeta42 in both cell cultures. Instead, high-dose (5x) brimonidine appeared to increase the toxicity to cell viability and DeltaPsim in cultures exposed to Abeta42. However, this was not due to medication toxicity alone, because high-dose (5x) brimonidine without exposure to Abeta42 did not affect the cell viability in both cell types. CONCLUSION: Brimonidine may have a role in preventing oxidative cellular injury in AMD. However, this role does not appear to translate into protection against some of the cytotoxic effects observed from this in vitro model of GA. In this cellular model of GA, brimonidine is able to reduce oxidative stress but is unable to rescue cell viability or prevent mitochondrial dysfunction.

30339962|t|Beta amyloid deposition maps onto hippocampal and subiculum atrophy in dementia with Lewy bodies.
30339962|a|Although dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a synucleinopathy, it is frequently accompanied by beta amyloid (Abeta) accumulation. Elucidating the relationships of Abeta with gray matter atrophy in DLB may yield insights regarding the contributions of comorbid Alzheimer's disease to its disease progression. Twenty healthy controls and 25 DLB subjects underwent clinical assessment, [18F]-Florbetapir, and 3T magnetic resonance imaging. FreeSurfer was used to estimate cortical thickness and subcortical volumes, and PetSurfer was used to quantify [18F]-Florbetapir standardized uptake value ratio. Principal component analysis was used to identify the dominant Abeta component for correlations with regional cortical thickness, hippocampal subfields, and subcortical structures. Relative to healthy controls, the DLB group demonstrated increased Abeta in widespread regions encompassing the frontal and temporoparietal cortices, whereas cortical thinning was restricted to the temporal lobe. Among DLB subjects, the Abeta component was significantly associated with more severe hippocampal and subiculum atrophy. These findings may reflect an early process of superimposed AD-like atrophy in DLB, thereby conferring support for the therapeutic potential of anti-Abeta interventions in people with DLB.

30341156|t|Clinical phenotype, atrophy, and small vessel disease in APOEepsilon2 carriers with Alzheimer disease.
30341156|a|OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical phenotype, gray matter atrophy patterns, and small vessel disease in patients who developed prodromal or probable Alzheimer disease dementia, despite carrying the protective APOEepsilon2 allele. METHODS: We included 36 beta-amyloid-positive (by CSF or PET) APOEepsilon2 carriers (all epsilon2/epsilon3) with mild cognitive impairment or dementia due to Alzheimer disease who were matched for age and diagnosis (ratio 1:2) to APOEepsilon3 homozygotes and APOEepsilon4 carriers (70% epsilon3/epsilon4 and 30% epsilon4/epsilon4). We assessed neuropsychological performance across 4 cognitive domains (memory, attention, executive, and language functions), performed voxelwise and region of interest analyses of gray matter atrophy on T1-weighted MRI, used fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images to automatically quantify white matter hyperintensity volumes, and assessed T2*-weighted images to identify microbleeds. Differences in cognitive domain scores, atrophy, and white matter hyperintensities between epsilon2 carriers, epsilon3 homozygotes, and epsilon4 carriers were assessed using analysis of variance analyses, and Pearson chi2 tests were used to examine differences in prevalence of microbleeds. RESULTS: We found that epsilon2 carriers performed worse on nonmemory domains compared to both epsilon3 homozygotes and epsilon4 carriers but better on memory compared to epsilon4 carriers. Voxelwise T1-weighted MRI analyses showed asymmetric (left > right) temporoparietal-predominant atrophy with subtly less involvement of medial-temporal structures in epsilon2 carriers compared to epsilon4 carriers. Finally, epsilon2 carriers had larger total white matter hyperintensity volumes compared to epsilon4 carriers (mean 10.4 vs 7.3 mL) and a higher prevalence of microbleeds compared to epsilon3 homozygotes (37.5% vs 18.3%). CONCLUSION: APOEepsilon2 carriers who develop Alzheimer disease despite carrying the protective allele display a nonamnestic clinical phenotype with more severe small vessel disease.

30342351|t|Nitration of amyloid-beta peptide (1-42) as a protective mechanism for the amyloid-beta peptide (1-42) against copper ion toxicity.
30342351|a|It is known that copper ion (Cu(II)) binds to amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), induces Abeta oligomer formation and ultimately exacerbates Abeta-aggregation neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). It becomes interesting to know that how this chemical modification of Abeta would affect interaction of Abeta and Cu(II) and their roles in the development of AD. In this work, we investigated the interaction of Abeta1-42 nitration with the toxic Cu(II). It showed that Cu(II)induced Abeta1-42 nitration in the presence of nitrite and hydrogen peroxide. Circular dichroism studies also revealed significant conformational change of Abeta1-42 and Tyr10 nitrated amyloid-beta peptide(1-42) (Abeta1-42NT) when interacting with Cu(II). Even though nitration did not alter the binding of Abeta1-42 to Cu(II) or the peroxidative activity of Abeta1-42-Cu(II) complex, nitration ameliorated the aggregation and neurotoxicity of Abeta1-42 induced by Cu(II), which was also further confirmed by the cell study. Given our previous findings that Abeta nitration dramatically inhibited its aggregation and thus reduced its toxicity, we speculated that nitration of Abeta1-42 altered its intermolecular interaction, which protected itself against the toxicity of Cu(II). Based on this hypothesis, we propose that nitration of Abeta1-42 may be an important protective mechanism for normal function of Abeta1-42 and deserves more attention in AD drug development.

30348864|t|A novel lysosome-to-mitochondria signaling pathway disrupted by amyloid-beta oligomers.
30348864|a|The mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease are incompletely understood. Using two-photon fluorescence lifetime microscopy of the coenzymes, NADH and NADPH, and tracking brain oxygen metabolism with multi-parametric photoacoustic microscopy, we show that activation of lysosomal mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) by insulin or amino acids stimulates mitochondrial activity and regulates mitochondrial DNA synthesis in neurons. Amyloid-beta oligomers, which are precursors of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease brain and stimulate mTORC1 protein kinase activity at the plasma membrane but not at lysosomes, block this Nutrient-induced Mitochondrial Activity (NiMA) by a mechanism dependent on tau, which forms neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease brain. NiMA was also disrupted in fibroblasts derived from two patients with tuberous sclerosis complex, a genetic disorder that causes dysregulation of lysosomal mTORC1. Thus, lysosomal mTORC1 couples nutrient availability to mitochondrial activity and links mitochondrial dysfunction to Alzheimer's disease by a mechanism dependent on the soluble building blocks of the poorly soluble plaques and tangles.

30349106|t|A histone acetylome-wide association study of Alzheimer's disease identifies disease-associated H3K27ac differences in the entorhinal cortex.
30349106|a|We quantified genome-wide patterns of lysine H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) in entorhinal cortex samples from Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases and matched controls using chromatin immunoprecipitation and highly parallel sequencing. We observed widespread acetylomic variation associated with AD neuropathology, identifying 4,162 differential peaks (false discovery rate < 0.05) between AD cases and controls. Differentially acetylated peaks were enriched in disease-related biological pathways and included regions annotated to genes involved in the progression of amyloid-beta and tau pathology (for example, APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, and MAPT), as well as regions containing variants associated with sporadic late-onset AD. Partitioned heritability analysis highlighted a highly significant enrichment of AD risk variants in entorhinal cortex H3K27ac peak regions. AD-associated variable H3K27ac was associated with transcriptional variation at proximal genes including CR1, GPR22, KMO, PIM3, PSEN1, and RGCC. In addition to identifying molecular pathways associated with AD neuropathology, we present a framework for genome-wide studies of histone modifications in complex disease.

30349969|t|Questions concerning the role of amyloid-beta in the definition, aetiology and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
30349969|a|The dominant hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) aetiology, the neuropathological guidelines for diagnosing AD and the majority of high-profile therapeutic efforts, in both research and in clinical practice, have been built around one possible causal factor, amyloid-beta (Abeta). However, the causal link between Abeta and AD remains unproven. Here, in the context of a detailed assessment of historical and contemporary studies, we raise critical questions regarding the role of Abeta in the definition, diagnosis and aetiology of AD. We illustrate that a holistic view of the available data does not support an unequivocal conclusion that Abeta has a central or unique role in AD. Instead, the data suggest alternative views of AD aetiology are potentially valid, at this time. We propose that an unbiased way forward for the field, beyond the current Abeta-centric approach, without excluding a role for Abeta, is required to come to an accurate understanding of AD dementia and, ultimately, an effective treatment.

30350003|t|Curcumin-loaded chitosan-bovine serum albumin nanoparticles potentially enhanced Abeta 42 phagocytosis and modulated macrophage polarization in Alzheimer's disease.
30350003|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder in the elderly population. In the treatment of AD, some obstacles, including drug penetration difficulty through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), inadequate clearance of the Abeta peptide, and the massive release of inflammatory factors, must be urgently overcome. To solve these problems, we developed special and novel nanoparticles (NPs) made of chitosan (CS) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) to enhance the penetration of drugs through the BBB. Curcumin as a potent anti-inflammatory agent was used to increase the phagocytosis of the Abeta peptide. The results demonstrated that curcumin-loaded CS-BSA NPs effectively increased drug penetration through the BBB, promoted the activation of microglia, and further accelerated the phagocytosis of the Abeta peptide. Furthermore, curcumin-loaded CS-BSA NPs inhibited the TLR4-MAPK/NF-kappaB signaling pathway and further downregulated M1 macrophage polarization. This study suggested that curcumin-loaded CS-BSA NPs hold the potential to enhance Abeta 42 phagocytosis through modulating macrophage polarization in AD.

30352114|t|Association of Preclinical Alzheimer Disease With Optical Coherence Tomographic Angiography Findings.
30352114|a|Importance: Biomarker testing for asymptomatic, preclinical Alzheimer disease (AD) is invasive and expensive. Optical coherence tomographic angiography (OCTA) is a noninvasive technique that allows analysis of retinal and microvascular anatomy, which is altered in early-stage AD. Objective: To determine whether OCTA can detect early retinal alterations in cognitively normal study participants with preclinical AD diagnosed by criterion standard biomarker testing. Design, Setting, and Participants: This case-control study included 32 participants recruited from the Charles F. and Joanne Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center, Washington University in St Louis, St Louis, Missouri. Results of extensive neuropsychometric testing determined that all participants were cognitively normal. Participants underwent positron emission tomography and/or cerebral spinal fluid testing to determine biomarker status. Individuals with prior ophthalmic disease, media opacity, diabetes, or uncontrolled hypertension were excluded. Data were collected from July 1, 2016, through September 30, 2017, and analyzed from July 30, 2016, through December 31, 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: Automated measurements of retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, ganglion cell layer thickness, inner and outer foveal thickness, vascular density, macular volume, and foveal avascular zone were collected using an OCTA system from both eyes of all participants. Separate model III analyses of covariance were used to analyze individual data outcome. Results: Fifty-eight eyes from 30 participants (53% female; mean [SD] age, 74.5 [5.6] years; age range, 62-92 years) were included in the analysis. One participant was African American and 29 were white. Fourteen participants had biomarkers positive for AD and thus a diagnosis of preclinical AD (mean [SD] age, 73.5 [4.7] years); 16 without biomarkers served as a control group (mean [SD] age, 75.4 [6.6] years). The foveal avascular zone was increased in the biomarker-positive group compared with controls (mean [SD], 0.364 [0.095] vs 0.275 [0.060] mm2; P = .002). Mean (SD) inner foveal thickness was decreased in the biomarker-positive group (66.0 [9.9] vs 75.4 [10.6] mum; P = .03). Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that cognitively healthy individuals with preclinical AD have retinal microvascular abnormalities in addition to architectural alterations and that these changes occur at earlier stages of AD than has previously been demonstrated. Longitudinal studies in larger cohorts are needed to determine whether this finding has value in identifying preclinical AD.

30354142|t|Orientation of a Diagnostic Ligand Bound to Macroscopically Aligned Amyloid-beta Fibrils Determined by Solid-State NMR.
30354142|a|With amyloid diseases poised to become a major health burden in countries with aging populations, diagnostic molecules that aid the detection of amyloid in vitro and in vivo are of considerable clinical value. Understanding how such ligands recognize their amyloid targets would help to design diagnostics that target specific amyloid types associated with a particular disease, but methods to provide comprehensive information are underdeveloped. Here, solid-state NMR is used to determine the molecular orientation of the amyloid diagnostic 1-fluoro-2,5-bis[( E)-3-carboxy-4-hydroxystyryl]-benzene (FSB) when bound to fibrils of the Alzheimer's amyloid-beta polypeptide aligned on a planar substrate. The 19F NMR spectrum of the aligned complex reveals that FSB is oriented approximately parallel with the fibril long axis and bridges four hydrogen-bonded beta-sheets. In addition to providing atomic details to aid the design of amyloid-specific diagnostics, this approach will also illuminate the molecular mechanisms of accessory molecules in amyloid disease.

30355700|t|Circulating cortisol and cognitive and structural brain measures: The Framingham Heart Study.
30355700|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of early morning serum cortisol with cognitive performance and brain structural integrity in community-dwelling young and middle-aged adults without dementia. METHODS: We evaluated dementia-free Framingham Heart Study (generation 3) participants (mean age 48.5 years, 46.8% men) who underwent cognitive testing for memory, abstract reasoning, visual perception, attention, and executive function (n = 2,231) and brain MRI (n = 2018) to assess total white matter, lobar gray matter, and white matter hyperintensity volumes and fractional anisotropy (FA) measures. We used linear and logistic regression to assess the relations of cortisol (categorized in tertiles, with the middle tertile as referent) to measures of cognition, MRI volumes, presence of covert brain infarcts and cerebral microbleeds, and voxel-based microstructural white matter integrity and gray matter density, adjusting for age, sex, APOE, and vascular risk factors. RESULTS: Higher cortisol (highest tertile vs middle tertile) was associated with worse memory and visual perception, as well as lower total cerebral brain and occipital and frontal lobar gray matter volumes. Higher cortisol was associated with multiple areas of microstructural changes (decreased regional FA), especially in the splenium of corpus callosum and the posterior corona radiata. The association of cortisol with total cerebral brain volume varied by sex (p for interaction = 0.048); higher cortisol was inversely associated with cerebral brain volume in women (p = 0.001) but not in men (p = 0.717). There was no effect modification by the APOE4 genotype of the relations of cortisol and cognition or imaging traits. CONCLUSION: Higher serum cortisol was associated with lower brain volumes and impaired memory in asymptomatic younger to middle-aged adults, with the association being evident particularly in women.

30359879|t|Comparison of longitudinal Abeta in nondemented elderly and Down syndrome.
30359879|a|Down syndrome (DS) predisposes individuals to early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using Pittsburgh Compound B ([11C]PiB), a pattern of striatal amyloid beta (Abeta) that is elevated relative to neocortical binding has been reported, similar to that of nondemented autosomal dominant AD mutation carriers. However, it is not known whether changes in striatal and neocortical [11C]PiB retention differ over time in a nondemented DS population when compared to changes in a nondemented elderly (NDE) population. The purpose of this work was to assess longitudinal changes in trajectories of Abeta in a nondemented DS compared to an NDE cohort. The regional trajectories for anterior ventral striatum (AVS), frontal cortex, and precuneus [11C]PiB retention were explored over time using linear mixed effects models with fixed effects of time, cohort, and time-by-cohort interactions and subject as random effects. Significant differences between DS and NDE cohort trajectories for all 3 region of interests were observed (p < 0.05), with the DS cohort showing a faster accumulation in the AVS and slower accumulation in the frontal cortex and precuneus compared to the NDE cohort. These data add to the previously reported distinct pattern of early striatal deposition not commonly seen in sporadic AD by demonstrating that individuals with DS may also accumulate Abeta at a rate faster in the AVS when compared to NDE subjects.

30361088|t|Endogenous amyloid-beta mediates memory forgetting in the normal brain.
30361088|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) is known to be one of the strong candidate molecules for initiating Alzheimer's disease and has been extensively studied in the light of disease pathophysiology. However, it is still elusive what roles Abeta play in the normal brain. In this study, we report that Abeta is required for memory forgetting in the normal brain. We monitored object recognition memory, and in order to quench soluble Abeta, we microinjected anti-Abeta antibody (4G8) into the ventricles after memory acquisition. Microinjection of anti-Abeta antibody prolonged the maintenance of object recognition memory. This effect appeared not to be due to modulation of memory consolidation since antibody injection after memory consolidation still had a similar effect on memory maintenance. Furthermore, the maintenance of object recognition memory was prolonged in Fcgr2b KO mice, which lacks IgG Fcgamma receptor II-b (FcgammaRIIb), a receptor for soluble Abeta oligomers. Taken together, these findings suggest that endogenous Abeta is involved in memory forgetting in the normal brain.

30362021|t|Analysis of Motor Function in Amyloid Precursor-Like Protein 2 Knockout Mice: The Effects of Ageing and Sex.
30362021|a|The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a member of a conserved gene family that includes the amyloid precursor-like proteins 1 (APLP1) and 2 (APLP2). APP and APLP2 share a high degree of similarity, and have overlapping patterns of spatial and temporal expression in the central and peripheral tissues, in particular at the neuromuscular junction. APP-family knockout (KO) studies have helped elucidate aspects of function and functional redundancy amongst the APP-family members. In the present study, we investigated motor performance of APLP2-KO mice and the effect sex differences and age-related changes have on motor performance. APLP2-KO and WT (on C57Bl6 background) littermates control mice from 8 (young adulthood) to 48 weeks (middle age) were investigated. Analysis of motor neuron and muscle morphology showed APLP2-KO females but not males, had less age-related motor function impairments. We observed age and sex differences in both motor neuron number and muscle fiber size distribution for APLP2-KO mice compared to WT (C57Bl6). These alterations in the motor neuron number and muscle fiber distribution pattern may explain why female APLP2-KO mice have far better motor function behaviour during ageing.

30362029|t|Evidence of intraneuronal Abeta accumulation preceding tau pathology in the entorhinal cortex.
30362029|a|Growing evidence gathered from transgenic animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) indicates that the intraneuronal accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides is an early event in the AD pathogenesis, producing cognitive deficits before the deposition of insoluble plaques. Levels of soluble Abeta are also a strong indicator of synaptic deficits and concurrent AD neuropathologies in post-mortem AD brain; however, it remains poorly understood how this soluble amyloid pool builds within the brain in the decades leading up to diagnosis, when a patient is likely most amenable to early therapeutic interventions. Indeed, characterizing early intracellular Abeta accumulation in humans has been hampered by the lack of Abeta-specific antibodies, variability in the quality of available human brain tissue and the limitations of conventional microscopy. We therefore sought to investigate the development of the intraneuronal Abeta pathology using extremely high-quality post-mortem brain material obtained from a cohort of non-demented subjects with short post-mortem intervals and processed by perfusion-fixation. Using well-characterized monoclonal antibodies, we demonstrate that the age-dependent intraneuronal accumulation of soluble Abeta is pervasive throughout the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, and that this phase of the amyloid pathology becomes established within AD-vulnerable regions before the deposition of Abeta plaques and the formation of tau neurofibrillary tangles. We also show for the first time in post-mortem human brain that Abeta oligomers do in fact accumulate intraneuronally, before the formation of extracellular plaques. Finally, we validated the origin of the Abeta-immunopositive pool by resolving Abeta- and APP/CTF-immunoreactive sites using super resolution structured illumination microscopy. Together, these findings indicate that the lifelong accrual of intraneuronal Abeta may be a potential trigger for downstream AD-related pathogenic events in early disease stages.

30362958|t|Sirtuin 3 attenuates amyloid-beta induced neuronal hypometabolism.
30362958|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is manifested by regional cerebral hypometabolism. Sirtuin 3 (Sirt3) is localized in mitochondria and regulates cellular metabolism, but the role of Sirt3 in AD-related hypometabolism remains elusive. We used expression profiling and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to analyze cortical neurons from a transgenic mouse model of AD (APPSwInd). Based on WGCNA results, we measured NAD+ level, NAD+/ NADH ratio, Sirt3 protein level and its deacetylation activity, and ATP production across both in vivo and in vitro models. To investigate the effect of Sirt3 on amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced mitochondria damage, we knocked down and over-expressed Sirt3 in hippocampal cells. WGCNA revealed Sirt3 as a key player in Abeta-related hypometabolism. In APP mice, the NAD+ level, NAD+/ NADH ratio, Sirt3 protein level and activity, and ATP production were all reduced compared to the control. As a result, learning and memory performance were impaired in 9-month-old APP mice compared to wild type controls. Using hippocampal HT22 cells model, Sirt3 overexpression increased Sirt3 deacetylation activity, rescued mitochondria function, and salvaged ATP production, which were damaged by Abeta. Sirt3 plays an important role in regulating Abeta-induced cerebral hypometabolism. This study suggests a potential direction for AD therapy.

30365041|t|CZ2HF mitigates beta-amyloid 25-35 fragment-induced learning and memory impairment through inhibition of neuroinflammation and apoptosis in rats.
30365041|a|Cu-zhi-2-hao-fang (CZ2HF), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been used clinically for the treatment of amnesia. However, whether CZ2HF is capable of alleviating learning and memory impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains to be elucidated. The present study was designed to explore the effect and mechanism of CZ2HF on beta-amyloid 25-35 (Abeta25-35)-induced impairment in the learning and memory of rats. Morris water maze test was used to determine spatial learning and memory ability in Abeta25-35-induced AD rats and hippocampal neuronal damage and apoptosis were observed using hematoxylin and eosin staining, Nissl staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assays, respectively. The levels of beta-amyloid 1-42 (Abeta1-42), pro-inflammatory factors, such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and apoptosis-associated genes including B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X, apoptosis regulator (Bax), pro-caspase-3, inhibitor of kappaB (IkappaB-alpha) degradation and phosphorylated-nuclear factor-kappaB p65 (p-NF-kappaB p65) activation were analyzed using western blotting. The findings of the present study revealed that CZ2HF treatment significantly attenuated Abeta25-35-induced cognitive impairments in rats. Subsequently, CZ2HF treatment markedly inhibited neuronal damage and deletions. Furthermore, CZ2HF reduced TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, COX-2 protein expression levels, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, and reduced Abeta1-42 and active-caspase-3 levels. In addition, IkappaB-alpha degradation and p-NF-kappaB p65 activation were reduced by CZ2HF. These findings suggested that CZ2HF treatment improved Abeta25-35-induced learning and memory impairment and hippocampal neuronal injury, and its underlying mechanism may be due to the inhibition of neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis. CZ2HF may be a potential agent for the treatment of AD.

30365928|t|Accurate risk estimation of beta-amyloid positivity to identify prodromal Alzheimer's disease: Cross-validation study of practical algorithms.
30365928|a|INTRODUCTION: The aim was to create readily available algorithms that estimate the individual risk of beta-amyloid (Abeta) positivity. METHODS: The algorithms were tested in BioFINDER (n = 391, subjective cognitive decline or mild cognitive impairment) and validated in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (n = 661, subjective cognitive decline or mild cognitive impairment). The examined predictors of Abeta status were demographics; cognitive tests; white matter lesions; apolipoprotein E (APOE); and plasma Abeta42/Abeta40, tau, and neurofilament light. RESULTS: Abeta status was accurately estimated in BioFINDER using age, 10-word delayed recall or Mini-Mental State Examination, and APOE (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve = 0.81 [0.77-0.85] to 0.83 [0.79-0.87]). When validated, the models performed almost identical in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve = 0.80-0.82) and within different age, subjective cognitive decline, and mild cognitive impairment populations. Plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 improved the models slightly. DISCUSSION: The algorithms are implemented on http://amyloidrisk.com where the individual probability of being Abeta positive can be calculated. This is useful in the workup of prodromal Alzheimer's disease and can reduce the number needed to screen in Alzheimer's disease trials.

30366065|t|Cerebral inoculation of human A53T alpha-synuclein reduces spatial memory decline and amyloid-beta aggregation in APP/PS1 transgenic mice of Alzheimer's disease.
30366065|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide and alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) are major components of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease (PD), respectively. Co-occurrence of Abeta and alpha-syn in the senile brains of AD and LB diseases suggests interactions between the two proteins. However, the significance of the overlapping deposition, especially the effects of alpha-syn on the Abeta aggregation, still remains to be clarified. In the present study, we investigated the effects of alpha-syn pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) injection on the cognitive behaviors and Abeta deposition in the brain of APP/PS1 transgenic AD mice by using Morris water maze (MWM) test, immunohistochemistry and western blot techniques. We found that APP/PS1 transgenic mice exhibited an obvious elevation in the alpha-syn load, as well as Abeta deposition in the brain compared with wild type of C57 BL littermates. 5 months after cerebral injection of exogenous alpha-syn, MWM tests showed an alleviation in cognitive impairments in APP/PS1 mice; western blot and immunohistochemistry experiments also exhibited a significant reduction in Abeta level in the brain of APP/PS1 mice injected with alpha-syn. These results suggest that alpha-syn aggregated in the brain of AD may act as a protective factor and defend the brain tissue from early Abeta deposition and cognitive deficits.

30367931|t|Methamphetamine exposure induces neuropathic protein beta-Amyloid expression.
30367931|a|Methamphetamine (METH) abusing contributes to dopaminergic neurons degeneration, resulting inParkinson's disease (PD)-like changes. More recently, the association between METH exposure and the Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like changes gained more attention, however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether METH exposure promotes the formation of Abeta42, one of the key AD-like pathological proteins. With the cell model PC-12 cell line, it showed that METH treatment significantly increased the level of the precursor protein APP and its hydrolysates CTFs expression in a dose-dependent manner. In parallel, with the ELISA assay, we found that METH exposure contributed to an obvious elevation of the Abeta1-42 excretion in the cell culture supernatant. Therefore, we examined the expression of p-GSK3alpha and BACE-1, which were responsible for APP and Abeta1-42 generation respectively, it suggested in that METH obviously activated the p-GSK3alpha and increased the level of BACE-1, and the expression of BACE-1 was also detected by the immunofluorescence, with the significant elevation of the BACE-1 fluorescence intensity. In conclusion, METH treatment promotes the expression of Abeta precursor protein APP and its hydrolysis product CTFs and Abeta1-42, and p-GSK3alpha as well as BACE-1 may be involved in this process.

30367942|t|Amyloid-peptide beta 42 Enhances the Oligomerization and Neurotoxicity of apoE4: The C-terminal Residues Leu279, Lys282 and Gln284 Modulate the Structural and Functional Properties of apoE4.
30367942|a|Apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4), one of the three apoE isoforms, is the strongest factor for raising the risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and has been proposed to play a major role in AD pathogenesis. Amyloid-peptide beta 42 (Abeta42) has also been proposed to affect neuronal degeneration and AD pathogenesis, possibly by interacting with apoE. Previous studies have shown that the functions of apoE forms can be dictated by their structural and biophysical properties. Here we show that apoE4 can form SDS-stable oligomers, possibly reflecting aggregated forms, which increase following incubation of apoE4 with Abeta42. In addition, extracellular apoE4 is cytotoxic for human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells, while Abeta42 enhances the cytotoxicity of apoE4. Carboxyl-terminal point mutations L279Q, K282A or Q284A reduced the capacity of apoE4 to form SDS-stable oligomers, as well as its cytotoxicity, both in the absence and presence of Abeta42. Structural and thermodynamic analyses showed that all three apoE4 mutants have significantly increased alpha-helical and decreased beta-sheet content, have reduced portion of hydrophobic surfaces exposed to the solvent and have a reduced conformational stability during chemical denaturation. Overall, our data highlight a pathogenic role of apoE4 that could be linked to the capacity of the protein to form oligomeric species especially in the presence of Abeta42 and to induce cytotoxicity. Carboxyl-terminal residues L279, K282 or Q284 appear to be involved in the conformation of apoE4 that may underlie the protein's functional properties related to neurotoxicity.

30371082|t|Molecular Determinants of Abeta42 Adsorption to Amyloid Fibril Surfaces.
30371082|a|The long lag times and subsequent rapid growth of Alzheimer's Abeta42 fibrils can be explained by a secondary nucleation step, in which existing fibril surfaces are able to nucleate the formation of new fibrils via an autocatalytic process. The molecular mechanism of secondary nucleation, however, is still unknown. Here we investigate the first step, namely, adsorption of the Abeta42 peptide monomers onto the fibril surface. Using long all-atom molecular simulations and an enhanced sampling scheme, we are able to generate a diverse ensemble of binding events. The resulting thermodynamics of adsorption are consistent with experiment as well as with the requirements for effective autocatalysis determined from coarse-grained simulations. We identify the key interactions stabilizing the adsorbed state, which are predominantly polar in nature, and relate them to the effects of known disease-causing mutations.

30372682|t|Protofibrillar and Fibrillar Amyloid-beta Binding Proteins in Cerebrospinal Fluid.
30372682|a|Aggregation and deposition of misfolded amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide in the brain is central to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Oligomeric, protofibrillar, and fibrillar forms of Abeta are believed to be neurotoxic and cause neurodegeneration in AD, but the toxicity mechanisms are not well understood and may involve Abeta-interacting molecular partners. In a previous study, we identified potential Abeta42 protofibrillar-binding proteins in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using an engineered version of Abeta42 (Abeta42CC) that forms protofibrils, but not fibrils. Here we studied binding of proteins to Abeta42 fibrils in AD and non-AD CSF and compared these with protofibrillar Abeta42CC-binding partners. Abeta42 fibrils sequestered 2.4-fold more proteins than Abeta42CC protofibrils. Proteins with selective binding to fibrillar aggregates with low nanomolar affinity were identified. We also found that protofibrillar and fibrillar Abeta-binding proteins represent distinct functional categories. Abeta42CC protofibrils triggered interactions with proteins involved in catalytic activities, like transferases and oxidoreductases, while Abeta42 fibrils were more likely involved in binding to proteoglycans, growth factors and neuron-associated proteins, e.g., neurexin-1, -2, and -3. Interestingly, 10 brain-enriched proteins were identified among the fibril-binding proteins, while protofibril-extracted proteins had more general expression patterns. Both types of Abeta aggregates bound several extracellular proteins. Additionally, we list a set of CSF proteins that might have potential to discriminate between AD and non-AD CSF samples. The results may be of relevance both for biomarker studies and for studies of Abeta-related toxicity mechanisms.

30374196|t|Neurogenetic contributions to amyloid beta and tau spreading in the human cortex.
30374196|a|Tau and amyloid beta (Abeta) proteins accumulate along neuronal circuits in Alzheimer's disease. Unraveling the genetic background for the regional vulnerability of these proteinopathies can help in understanding the mechanisms of pathology progression. To that end, we developed a novel graph theory approach and used it to investigate the intersection of longitudinal Abeta and tau positron emission tomography imaging of healthy adult individuals and the genetic transcriptome of the Allen Human Brain Atlas. We identified distinctive pathways for tau and Abeta accumulation, of which the tau pathways correlated with cognitive levels. We found that tau propagation and Abeta propagation patterns were associated with a common genetic profile related to lipid metabolism, in which APOE played a central role, whereas the tau-specific genetic profile was classified as 'axon related' and the Abeta profile as 'dendrite related'. This study reveals distinct genetic profiles that may confer vulnerability to tau and Abeta in vivo propagation in the human brain.

30375231|t|Structural Polymorphs Suggest Competing Pathways for the Formation of Amyloid Fibrils That Diverge from a Common Intermediate Species.
30375231|a|It is now recognized that many amyloid-forming proteins can associate into multiple fibril structures. Here, we use two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy to study two fibril polymorphs formed by human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP or amylin), which is associated with type 2 diabetes. The polymorphs exhibit different degrees of structural organization near the loop region of hIAPP fibrils. The relative populations of these polymorphs are systematically altered by the presence of macrocyclic peptides which template beta-sheet formation at specific sections of the hIAPP sequence. These experiments are consistent with polymorphs that result from competing pathways for fibril formation and that the macrocycles bias hIAPP aggregation toward one pathway or the other. Another macrocyclic peptide that matches the loop region but extends the lag time leaves the relative populations of the polymorphs unaltered, suggesting that the branching point for structural divergence occurs after the lag phase, when the oligomers convert into seeds that template fibril formation. Thus, we conclude that the structures of the polymorphs stem from restricting oligomers along diverging folding pathways, which has implications for drug inhibition, cytotoxicity, and the free energy landscape of hIAPP aggregation.

30375373|t|Mediterranean diet adherence and rate of cerebral Abeta-amyloid accumulation: Data from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Study of Ageing.
30375373|a|Accumulating research has linked Mediterranean diet (MeDi) adherence with slower cognitive decline and reduced Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. However, no study to-date has examined the relationship between MeDi adherence and accumulation of cerebral Abeta-amyloid (Abeta; a pathological hallmark of AD) in older adults. Cognitively normal healthy control participants of the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) Study of Ageing completed the Cancer Council of Victoria Food Frequency Questionnaire at baseline, which was used to construct a MeDi score for each participant (score range 0-9; higher score indicating higher adherence). Cerebral Abeta load was quantified by Pittsburgh Compound B positron emission tomography at baseline, 18 and 36 months: Only individuals categorised as "Abeta accumulators", and thus considered to be on the AD pathway, were included in the analysis (N = 77). The relationship between MeDi adherence, MeDi components, and change in cerebral Abeta load (baseline to 36 months) was evaluated using Generalised Linear Modelling, accounting for age, gender, education, Apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele status, body mass index and total energy intake. Higher MeDi score was associated with less Abeta accumulation in our cohort (beta = -0.01 +- 0.004, p = 0.0070). Of the individual MeDi score components, a high intake of fruit was associated with less accumulation of Abeta (beta = -0.04 +- 0.01, p = 0.00036). Our results suggest MeDi adherence is associated with reduced cerebral AD pathology accumulation over time. When our results are considered collectively with previous data linking the MeDi to slower cognitive decline, it is apparent that MeDi adherence warrants further investigation in the quest to delay AD onset.

30376649|t|Grasping at straws: the failure of solanezumab to modify mild Alzheimer's disease.
30376649|a|INTRODUCTION: The amyloid-beta (Abeta) cascade hypothesis is that reducing Abeta levels in the brain will be beneficial in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Solanezumab is a humanized analog of a murine antibody that selectively targets the central domain of the soluble form of Abeta. In the EXPEDITION 1 and 2 Phase 3 clinical trials, solanezumab was shown to be ineffective in subjects with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease, and to have no effect on brain Abeta burden. Areas covered: This evaluation considers the secondary analysis of (EXPEDITION 1 and 2), which led to the EXPEDITION 3 trial of solanezumab in subjects with mild Alzheimer's disease, and the results of EXPEDITION 3. Expert opinion: The secondary analysis of EXPEDITION 1 and 2 was limited to mild Alzheimer's disease, and showed improvements on some scales, but not others. This analysis did not report data on Abeta burden. In my opinion, this was a questionable basis to undertake a further phase trial with solanezumab. The EXPEDITION 3 trial of solanezumab in subjects with mild Alzheimer's disease was terminated early for ineffectiveness. With hindsight, solanezumab should have been discontinued after EXPEDITION 1 and 2, especially as it had not been shown to reduce Abeta burden.

30385800|t|Copper Redox Cycling Inhibits Abeta Fibre Formation and Promotes Fibre Fragmentation, while Generating a Dityrosine Abeta Dimer.
30385800|a|Oxidative stress and the formation of plaques which contain amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides are two key hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Dityrosine is found in the plaques of AD patients and Abeta dimers have been linked to neurotoxicity. Here we investigate the formation of Abeta dityrosine dimers promoted by Cu2+/+ Fenton reactions. Using fluorescence measurements and UV absorbance, we show that dityrosine can be formed aerobically when Abeta is incubated with Cu2+ and hydrogen-peroxide, or in a Cu2+ and ascorbate redox mixture. The dityrosine cross-linking can occur for both monomeric and fibrillar forms of Abeta. We show that oxidative modification of Abeta impedes the ability for Abeta monomer to form fibres, as indicated by the amyloid specific dye Thioflavin T (ThT). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicates the limited amyloid assemblies that form have a marked reduction in fibre length for Abeta(1-40). Importantly, the addition of Cu2+ and a reductant to preformed Abeta(1-40) fibers causes their widespread fragmentation, reducing median fibre lengths from 800 nm to 150 nm upon oxidation. The processes of covalent cross-linking of Abeta fibres, dimer formation, and fibre fragmentation within plaques are likely to have a significant impact on Abeta clearance and neurotoxicity.

30385819|t|Distinct amyloid distribution patterns in amyloid positive subcortical vascular cognitive impairment.
30385819|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) and cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) commonly coexist. They can occur independently by chance, or may interact with each other. We aimed to determine whether the distribution of Abeta in subcortical vascular cognitive impairments (SVCI) patients can be classified by the underlying pathobiologies. A total of 45 11C-Pittsburgh compound B PET positive (PiB(+)) SVCI patients were included in this study. They were classified using a new cluster analysis method which adopted the Louvain method, which finds optimal decomposition of the participants based on similarity of relative Abeta deposition pattern. We measured atherosclerotic cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) markers and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) markers. Forty-five PiB(+) SVCI patients were classified into two groups: 17 patients with the characteristic Alzheimer's disease like Abeta uptake with sparing of occipital region (OccSp) and 28 patients with occipital predominant Abeta uptake (OccP). Compared to OccSp group, OccP group had more postive association of atherosclerotic CSVD score (p for interaction = 0.044), but not CAA score with occipital/global ratio of PiB uptake. Our findings suggested that Abeta positive SVCI patients might consist of heterogeneous groups with combined CSVD and Abeta resulting from various pathobiologies. Furthermore, atherosclerotic CSVD might explain increased occipital Abeta uptakes.

30387527|t|Reduced brain amyloid burden in elderly patients with narcolepsy type 1.
30387527|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine whether brain amyloid burden in elderly patients with narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is lower than in controls, and to assess in patients with NT1 the relationships between amyloid burden, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) markers of Alzheimer disease (AD), CSF orexin-A, and cognitive profile. METHODS: Cognitive and 18 F-florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) data were compared in patients with NT1 aged >= 65 years (n = 23) and in age- and sex-matched controls free of clinical dementia selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; n = 69) and the Multi-Domain Intervention Alzheimer's Prevention Trial (MAPT-18F AV45-PET; n = 23) cohorts. The standardized uptake values (SUVs) of the cortical retention index for 6 regions of interest were computed and averaged to create a mean SUV ratio normalized to 3 subcortical reference regions (cerebellum, pons, and a composite region). A cortical/cerebellum SUV ratio >= 1.17 defined positive PET amyloid. RESULTS: Lower cortical amyloid burden was observed in the NT1 than in the ADNI and MAPT-AV45 groups (mean cortical/cerebellum SUV ratios = 0.95 +- 0.15, 1.11 +- 0.18 [p < 0.0001], and 1.14 +- 0.17 [p = 0.0005], respectively). Similar results were obtained with all subcortical reference regions and for all cortical regions of interest, except cingulum. Only 1 patient with NT1 (4.4%) had positive PET amyloid compared with 27.5% in the ADNI and 30.4% in the MAPT-AV45 group. In the NT1 group, cortical or regional amyloid load was not associated with CSF orexin-A, CSF AD biomarkers, or neuropsychological profile. INTERPRETATION: Lower brain amyloid burden, assessed by 18 F-florbetapir PET, in patients with NT1 suggests delayed appearance of amyloid plaques. ANN NEUROL 2019;85:74-83.

30388015|t|Hydrophobic Modification of Carboxyl-Terminated Polyamidoamine Dendrimer Surface Creates a Potent Inhibitor of Amyloid-beta Fibrillation.
30388015|a|Amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) fibrillogenesis is a major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD); inhibition of Abeta fibrillation is thus considered as a promising strategy for AD prevention and treatment. Our group has previously proposed the hydrophobic binding-electrostatic repulsion (HyBER) hypothesis, which provides guidance for the design of new amyloid inhibitors. Inspired by the HyBER hypothesis, we have herein proposed to synthesize hydrophobic-modified generation 5 carboxyl-terminated polyamidoamine dendrimer, denoted as PAMP, to create a potent inhibitor with a negatively charged hydrophobic surface. Results indicate that the PAMP with a proper degree of phenyl substitution (30-42%) alters the conformation of Abeta42 through both hydrophobic binding and electrostatic repulsive forces on its surface. With these well-balanced interactions, the inhibitor can even completely inhibit the formation of beta-sheet structure of the peptide, accompanied by changes at the level of the fibrillary architecture. Moreover, the results also indicate that changes of Abeta42 aggregation pathway influenced by the PAMP occur at the very early stage, so the PAMP can significantly avoid the formation of toxic intermediates of Abeta42 aggregation.

30388694|t|The effect of different alcohols on the Asp23-Lys28 and Asp23-Ala42 salt bridges of the most effective peptide in Alzheimer's disease: Molecular dynamics viewpoints.
30388694|a|The beta-amyloid peptide Abeta1-42 is the most effective peptide in the process of forming plaque and creating Alzheimer's. After the separation of Abeta1-42 from APP membrane protein, the membrane surface is transmitted to the extracellular environment, which is a crowded environment. On the other hand, stability of salt bridges Asp23-Lys28 and Lys28-Ala42 is important for monomer toxicity and fibrillation formation. In this work, the effects of ethanol, propanol, butanol, pentanol, hexanol, heptanol and octanol on the Asp23-Lys28 and Lys28-Ala42 salt bridges of the Abeta1-42 have been investigated by molecular dynamics simulation. The radial distribution function of the oxygen atoms of the water around the atoms Cgamma-Asp23, Nxi-Lys28 and O-Ala42 was calculated in the presence of the alcohols. The results show that the peak height of the radial distribution function around the Cgamma-Asp23 atom is larger than the other two atoms. Also, the numbering of water molecules in the interval corresponding to the first peak in the radial distribution function for all atoms involved in the two salt bridges Asp23-Lys28 and Lys28-Ala42 was calculated. The results show that the obtained coordinate numbers are within the range of experimental numbers reported for water. The results also show that the order of water molecules around the O-Ala42 is lower. The results of solvent accessible surface area of Abeta1-42 show that the Lys28-Ala42 Salt bridge stability is more important for toxicity of monomer.

30390718|t|Serum neurofilament light levels correlate with severity measures and neurodegeneration markers in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease.
30390718|a|BACKGROUND: Biomarkers that can track disease onset and progression in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD) are needed. We investigate whether serum neurofilament light (NfL) concentration is associated with clinical and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers in ADAD. We also evaluate serum NfL differences between clinical groups. METHODS: Serum NfL was measured cross-sectionally in 60 individuals from ADAD families using an ultrasensitive immunoassay on the Single molecule array (Simoa) platform and longitudinally in an exploratory study in a subset of six mutation carriers. Spearman coefficients assessed associations between serum NfL and relevant measures. Differences between groups were evaluated by Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS: Forty-two participants were mutation carriers: 22 symptomatic (SMC) and 20 asymptomatic (AMC). Eighteen subjects were non-carriers and cognitively normal (controls (CTR)). Serum NfL correlated with the estimated years from symptoms onset across mutation carriers (rho = 0.75, p < 0.001). In mutation carriers, serum NfL also showed strong correlation with clinical (rho = 0.70, p < 0.001) and cognitive (rho = -0.77, p < 0.001) measures and CSF NfL, total tau and phosphorylated tau levels (rho = 0.72, 0.71, and 0.71, respectively, all p < 0.001). Serum NfL concentration was higher in SMC than in AMC and CTR. CONCLUSIONS: Serum NfL might be a feasible non-invasive biomarker to track disease onset and severity in ADAD.

30392797|t|Changes in the Synaptic Proteome in Tauopathy and Rescue of Tau-Induced Synapse Loss by C1q Antibodies.
30392797|a|Synapse loss and Tau pathology are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies, but how Tau pathology causes synapse loss is unclear. We used unbiased proteomic analysis of postsynaptic densities (PSDs) in Tau-P301S transgenic mice to identify Tau-dependent alterations in synapses prior to overt neurodegeneration. Multiple proteins and pathways were altered in Tau-P301S PSDs, including depletion of a set of GTPase-regulatory proteins that leads to actin cytoskeletal defects and loss of dendritic spines. Furthermore, we found striking accumulation of complement C1q in the PSDs of Tau-P301S mice and AD patients. At synapses, C1q decorated perisynaptic membranes, accumulated in correlation with phospho-Tau, and was associated with augmented microglial engulfment of synapses and decline of synapse density. A C1q-blocking antibody inhibited microglial synapse removal in cultured neurons and in Tau-P301S mice, rescuing synapse density. Thus, inhibiting complement-mediated synapse removal by microglia could be a potential therapeutic target for Tau-associated neurodegeneration.

30393201|t|Involvement of GAT2/BGT-1 in the preventive effects of betaine on cognitive impairment and brain oxidative stress in amyloid beta peptide-injected mice.
30393201|a|In the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the deposition of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) is associated with oxidative stress, leading to cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration. Betaine (glycine betaine or trimethylglycine), known as an osmolyte and methyl donor in mammalian cells, has been reported to suppress the proinflammatory response and oxidative stress in the kidneys, but the effects of betaine on brain diseases remain to be determined. Here, to investigate the effects of betaine treatment on cognitive impairment and the increase in oxidative stress in the brain of an AD animal model, we performed a novel object recognition test and measured the malondialdehyde (MDA; a marker of oxidative stress) levels in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of mice intracerebroventricularly injected with Abeta25-35, an active fragment of Abeta. Betaine prevented cognitive impairment as well as increases of the cortical and hippocampal MDA levels in Abeta25-35-injected mice. Of note, NNC 05-2090, a selective inhibitor of betaine/GABA transporter-1 (GAT2/BGT-1), reduced the preventive effects of betaine on Abeta25-35-induced cognitive impairment without affecting the increased MDA levels in the brain of Abeta25-35-injected mice. As betaine is used as a substrate of GAT2/BGT-1, these results suggest that betaine is transported through GAT2/BGT-1 and prevents cognitive impairment in Abeta25-35-injected mice, but GAT2/BGT-1 function is not required for the antioxidant effects of betaine.

30394470|t|Evaluation of the photo-degradation of Alzheimer's amyloid fibrils with a label-free approach.
30394470|a|Degradation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregates has been considered as an attractive therapeutic and preventive strategy against Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, an in situ, real-time, and label-free technique is still lacking to understand the degradation process of Abeta aggregates. In this work, we developed a novel method to quantitatively evaluate the degradation of Abeta fibrils by photoactive meso-tetra(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin under UV irradiation with quartz crystal microbalance (QCM).

30397132|t|Inhibition of HDAC3 reverses Alzheimer's disease-related pathologies in vitro and in the 3xTg-AD mouse model.
30397132|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of age-related dementia. Neuropathological hallmarks of AD include brain deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques and accumulation of both hyperphosphorylated and acetylated tau. RGFP-966, a brain-penetrant and selective HDAC3 inhibitor, or HDAC3 silencing, increases BDNF expression, increases histone H3 and H4 acetylation, decreases tau phosphorylation and tau acetylation at disease-associated sites, reduces beta-secretase cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), and decreases Abeta1-42 accumulation in HEK-293 cells overexpressing APP with the double Swedish mutation (HEK/APPsw). In the triple transgenic AD mouse model (3xTg-AD), repeated administration of 3 and 10 mg/kg of RGFP-966 reverses pathological tau phosphorylation at Thr181, Ser202, and Ser396, increases levels of the Abeta degrading enzyme Neprilysin in plasma, decreases Abeta1-42 protein levels in the brain and periphery, and improves spatial learning and memory. Finally, we show that RGFP-966 decreases Abeta1-42 accumulation and both tau acetylation and phosphorylation at disease residues in neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells obtained from APOEepsilon4-carrying AD patients. These data indicate that HDAC3 plays an important regulatory role in the expression and regulation of proteins associated with AD pathophysiology, supporting the notion that HDAC3 may be a disease-modifying therapeutic target.

30398430|t|A Deep Learning Model to Predict a Diagnosis of Alzheimer Disease by Using 18F-FDG PET of the Brain.
30398430|a|Purpose To develop and validate a deep learning algorithm that predicts the final diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment, or neither at fluorine 18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET of the brain and compare its performance to that of radiologic readers. Materials and Methods Prospective 18F-FDG PET brain images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (2109 imaging studies from 2005 to 2017, 1002 patients) and retrospective independent test set (40 imaging studies from 2006 to 2016, 40 patients) were collected. Final clinical diagnosis at follow-up was recorded. Convolutional neural network of InceptionV3 architecture was trained on 90% of ADNI data set and tested on the remaining 10%, as well as the independent test set, with performance compared to radiologic readers. Model was analyzed with sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristic (ROC), saliency map, and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. Results The algorithm achieved area under the ROC curve of 0.98 (95% confidence interval: 0.94, 1.00) when evaluated on predicting the final clinical diagnosis of AD in the independent test set (82% specificity at 100% sensitivity), an average of 75.8 months prior to the final diagnosis, which in ROC space outperformed reader performance (57% [four of seven] sensitivity, 91% [30 of 33] specificity; P < .05). Saliency map demonstrated attention to known areas of interest but with focus on the entire brain. Conclusion By using fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET of the brain, a deep learning algorithm developed for early prediction of Alzheimer disease achieved 82% specificity at 100% sensitivity, an average of 75.8 months prior to the final diagnosis.

30399361|t|Amyloid-beta1-42 dynamically regulates the migration of neural stem/progenitor cells via MAPK-ERK pathway.
30399361|a|Neural stem/progenitor cell (NSPC) based therapy represents an attractive treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disorder with no effective treatment to date. This can be achieved by stimulating endogenous NSPCs and/or administrating exogenously produced NSPCs. Successful repair requires the migration of NSPCs to the loci where neuronal loss occurs, differentiation and integration into neural networks. However, the progressive loss of neurons in the brain of AD patients suggests that the repair by endogenous NSPCs in the setting of AD may be defective. The production and deposition of amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta1-42) peptides is thought to be a central event in the pathogenesis of AD. Here we report that Abeta1-42 peptides inhibit the migration of in vitro cultured NSPCs by disturbing the ERK-MAPK signal pathway. We found that the migratory capacity of NSPCs was compromised upon treatment with oligomeric Abeta1-42; the inhibitory effect occurred in a dose-dependent manner. Our previous studies have shown that Abeta1-42 triggers the expression of GRK2 by unknown mechanism. Herein we found that the Abeta1-42 evoked upregulation of GRK2 expression was attenuated upon treatment with the ERK inhibitor SCH772984 at 2.5 muM, but not with inhibitors for p38 or JNK. We detected a dose-dependent increase in levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 after incubation of cells with oligomeric Abeta1-42 peptides for 3 days. We observed that an increase in the phosphorylation of p38 and JNK coincided with reduced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 upon treatment with Abeta1-42 for 6 and/or 9 days. We hypothesize that the divergence of the activation of the MAPK family of pathways may contribute to the inhibition of NSPCs migration after the long-term incubation with Abeta1-42. Pretreatment with 1  muM MEK inhibitor U0126 reversed the effects of Abeta1-42 on GRK2 expression of and NSPC migration. Together, our results suggest that Abeta1-42 oligomers compromise the migratory capacity of NSPCs through the MEK-ERK pathway.

30400084|t|A Free Radical-Generating System Regulates Amyloid Oligomers: Involvement of Cathepsin B.
30400084|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta), a major component of senile plaques, is generated via the proteolysis of amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP). This cleavage also produces AbetaPP fragment-derived oligomers which can be highly neurotoxic. AbetaPP metabolism/processing is affected by many factors, one of which is oxidative stress (OS). Associated with aging, OS is an important risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. In addition, the protein degradation systems, especially those involving cathepsins, are impaired in aging brains. Moreover, cathepsin B (CTSB) is a cysteine protease with potentially specific roles in AbetaPP proteolysis (beta-secretase activity) and Abeta clearance (Abeta degradative activity). The present work examines the effect of OS and the involvement of CTSB in amyloid oligomer formation. The xanthine/xanthine oxidase (X-XOD) free radical generating system induced the partial inhibition of CTSB activity, which was accompanied by an increase in large amyloid oligomers. These were located throughout the cytosol and in endo-lysosomal vesicles. Cells treated with the CTSB inhibitor CA-074Me also showed increased amyloid oligomer levels, whereas those subjected to OS in the presence of the inhibitor showed no such increase. However, CTSB inhibition clearly modulated the AbetaPP metabolism/processing induced by X-XOD, as revealed by the increase in intracellular AbetaPP and secreted alpha-secretase-cleaved soluble AbetaPP. The present results suggest that CTSB participates in the changes of amyloid oligomer induced by mild OS.

30400099|t|Distinct White Matter Changes Associated with Cerebrospinal Fluid Amyloid-beta1-42 and Hypertension.
30400099|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and hypertension (HTN) are risk factors for development of white matter (WM) alterations and might be independently associated with these alterations in older adults. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the independent and synergistic effects of HTN and AD pathology on WM alterations. METHODS: Clinical measures of cerebrovascular disease risk were collected from 62 participants in University of Kentucky Alzheimer's Disease Center studies who also had cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling and MRI brain scans. CSF Abeta1-42 levels were measured as a marker of AD, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging and diffusion tensor imaging were obtained to assess WM macro- and microstructural properties. Linear regression analyses were used to assess the relationships among WM alterations, cerebrovascular disease risk, and AD pathology. Voxelwise analyses were performed to examine spatial patterns of WM alteration associated with each pathology. RESULTS: HTN and CSF Abeta1-42 levels were each associated with white matter hyperintensities (WMH). Also, CSF Abeta1-42 levels were associated with alterations in normal appearing white matter fractional anisotropy (NAWM-FA), whereas HTN was marginally associated with alterations in NAWM-FA. Linear regression analyses demonstrated significant main effects of HTN and CSF Abeta1-42 on WMH volume, but no significant HTNxCSF Abeta1-42 interaction. Furthermore, voxelwise analyses showed unique patterns of WM alteration associated with hypertension and CSF Abeta1-42. CONCLUSION: Associations of HTN and lower CSF Abeta1-42 with WM alteration were statistically and spatially distinct, suggesting independent rather than synergistic effects. Considering such spatial distributions may improve diagnostic accuracy to address each underlying pathology.

30401430|t|Liquid and Hydrogel Phases of PrPC Linked to Conformation Shifts and Triggered by Alzheimer's Amyloid-beta Oligomers.
30401430|a|Protein phase separation by low-complexity, intrinsically disordered domains generates membraneless organelles and links to neurodegeneration. Cellular prion protein (PrPC) contains such domains, causes spongiform degeneration, and is a receptor for Alzheimer's amyloid-beta oligomers (Abetao). Here, we show that PrPC separates as a liquid phase, in which alpha-helical Thr become unfolded. At the cell surface, PrPC Lys residues interact with Abetao to create a hydrogel containing immobile Abetao and relatively mobile PrPC. The Abetao/PrP hydrogel has a well-defined stoichiometry and dissociates with excess Abetao. NMR studies of hydrogel PrPC reveal a distinct alpha-helical conformation for natively unfolded amino-terminal Gly and Ala residues. Abetao/PrP hydrogel traps signal-transducing mGluR5 on the plasma membrane. Recombinant PrPC extracts endogenous Abetao from human Alzheimer's soluble brain lysates into hydrogel, and a PrPC antagonist releases Abetao from endogenous brain hydrogel. Thus, coupled phase and conformational transitions of PrPC are driven by Abeta species from Alzheimer's disease.

30402039|t|Sevoflurane Exacerbates Cognitive Impairment Induced by Abeta 1-40 in Rats through Initiating Neurotoxicity, Neuroinflammation, and Neuronal Apoptosis in Rat Hippocampus.
30402039|a|Objective: This study was aimed at investigating whether sevoflurane inhalation induced cognitive impairment in rats with a possible mechanism involved in the event. Methods: Thirty-two rats were randomly divided into four groups of normal saline (NS) + O2, NS + sevoflurane (sevo), amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) + O2, and Abeta + sevo. The rats in the four groups received bilateral intrahippocampus injections of NS or Abeta. The treated hippocampus was harvested after inhaling 30% O2 or 2.5% sevoflurane. Evaluation of cognitive function was performed by Morris water maze (MWZ) and an Abeta 1-42 level was determined by ELISA. Protein and mRNA expressions were executed by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, Western blotting, and qRT-PCR. Results: Compared with the NS-treated group, sevoflurane only caused cognitive impairment and increased the level of Abeta 1-42 of the brain in the Abeta-treated group. Sevoflurane inhalation but not O2 significantly increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule (IBA)1 expression in Abeta-treated hippocampus of rats. Expression levels for Bcl-xL, caspase-9, receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were significantly different in quantification of band intensity between the rats that inhaled O2 and sevoflurane in Abeta-treated groups (all P < 0.05). Interleukin- (IL-) 1beta, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA expression increased after the rats inhaled sevoflurane in the Abeta-treated group (both P < 0.01). There were no significant differences in the change of GFAP, IBA1, Bcl-xL, caspase-9, RAGE, BDNF, IL-1beta, NF-kappaB, and iNOS in the NS + O2 and NS + sevo group (all P > 0.05). Conclusion: Sevoflurane exacerbates cognitive impairment induced by Abeta 1-40 in rats through initiating neurotoxicity, neuroinflammation, and neuronal apoptosis in rat hippocampus.

30403004|t|Amyloid beta soluble forms and plasminogen activation system in Alzheimer's disease: Consequences on extracellular maturation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and therapeutic implications.
30403004|a|Soluble oligomeric forms of amyloid beta (Abeta) play an important role in causing the cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) by targeting and disrupting synaptic pathways. Thus, the present research is directed toward identifying the neuronal pathways targeted by soluble forms and, accordingly, develops alternative therapeutic strategies. The neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is synthesized as a precursor (pro-BDNF) which is cleaved extracellularly by plasmin to release the mature form. The conversion from pro-BDNF to BDNF is an important process that regulates neuronal activity and memory processes. Plasmin-dependent maturation of BDNF in the brain is regulated by plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), the natural inhibitor of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA). Therefore, tPA/PAI-1 system represents an important regulator of extracellular BDNF/pro-BDNF ratio. In this review, we summarize the data on the components of the plasminogen activation system and on BDNF in AD. Moreover, we will hypothesize a possible pathogenic mechanism caused by soluble Abeta forms based on the effects on tPA/PAI-1 system and on the consequence of an altered conversion from pro-BDNF to the mature BDNF in the brain of AD patients. Translation into clinic may include a better characterization of the disease stage and future direction on therapeutic targets.

30403186|t|Complement protein C5a enhances the beta-amyloid-induced neuro-inflammatory response in microglia in Alzheimer's disease.
30403186|a|OBJECTIVE: The dysregulation of neuro-inflammation is one of the attributes of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Over-expression of complement proteins co-localizes with neurofibrillary tangles, thereby indicating that a complement system may be involved in neuro-inflammation. Here, we report the influence of complement activation on the neuro-inflammation using a microglial cell line. METHODS: first, we performed a cytotoxic assay using the microglial cells BV-2. Second, after treatment of BV-2 cells with Abeta42 and/ or C5a, the anaphylatoxin derived from C5, we determined the expression levels of the pro-inflammatory factors TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6. Finally, we explored whether this neuroinflammatory response was mediated by JAK/ STAT3 signaling. RESULTS: C5a had an enhanced effect on the neural cell viability of BV-2 cells treated with Abeta42. In addition, C5a also increased the Abeta-induced neuro-inflammatory response, and these effects were blocked by the C5aR antagonist, PMX205. Finally, we demonstrated that the neuro-inflammatory responses induced by Abeta and C5a were mediated through JAK/STAT3 signaling. By blocking this pathway with an antagonist, AG490, the expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 was alleviated. CONCLUSION: The complement protein C5a could exaggerate the Abeta-induced neuroinflammatory response in microglia, and C5aR may be a potential therapeutic tool for AD treatment.

30403288|t|Alzheimer's Abeta1-40 peptide degradation by thermolysin: evidence of inhibition by a C-terminal Abeta product.
30403288|a|The interaction of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) with thermolysin (TLN) was investigated by X-ray crystallography. Structural models of the complexes of TLN with several Abeta fragments show that, despite the numerous possible cleavage sites of the Abeta sequence, the C-terminal product of Ala30-Ile31 cleavage does not dissociate, thus inhibiting the enzyme. The high similarity between the TLN structural motif and neprilysin (NEP), the most extensively studied peptidase associated with Abeta clearance, suggests that NEP should be more efficient against Abeta polymorphs where Ala30-Ile31 is inaccessible, which is in agreement with studies in living mice that point to the limited role of NEP in degrading soluble Abeta and its higher ability to degrade insoluble and/or oligomeric Abeta forms, producing only the Abeta10-37 intermediate.

30403785|t|Early microglial activation and peripheral inflammation in dementia with Lewy bodies.
30403785|a|Inflammation is increasingly recognized as part of the pathology of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, but its role in dementia with Lewy bodies remains unclear. Using multimodal imaging and peripheral cytokine analysis, we therefore investigated central and peripheral inflammation in this common form of dementia. Nineteen participants with probable dementia with Lewy bodies and 16 similarly aged controls underwent 3 T MRI and PET imaging with 11C-PK11195, a marker of microglial activation in vivo. Peripheral blood inflammatory cytokines were also measured in all subjects, as well as in an additional 10 controls, using the Mesoscale Human Cytokine 36 plex panel and additional assays for high sensitivity c-reactive protein, tumour necrosis factor receptor 1, IL-34, YKL-40 (chitinase-3-like protein 1) and colony stimulating factor 1. To test for the presence of in vivo amyloid, 11C-Pittsburgh compound B PET imaging was also performed in 16 of the dementia with Lewy body participants. Microglial activation was elevated in dementia with Lewy bodies subjects with mild disease when compared to those with moderate/severe impairment, where disease severity was indexed by cognitive performance on the revised Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination. In patients, strong correlations were found between cognitive performance and 11C-PK11195 non-displaceable binding potential in several regions including the caudate nucleus (R = 0.83, P = 0.00008) and cuneus (R = 0.77, P = 0.0005). Several inflammatory cytokines were altered in the patients compared to controls, with elevated macrophage inflammatory protein-3 (P = 0.001), IL-17A (P = 0.008) and IL-2 (P = 0.046) and reduced IL-8 (P = 0.024). There was no correlation between cortical 11C-Pittsburgh compound B standardized uptake value ratio and clinical features, regional 11C-PK11195 binding or peripheral cytokine levels. Nor was there any regional correlation between 11C-PK11195 non-displaceable binding potentials and 11C-Pittsburgh compound B standardized uptake value ratios. Our findings provide evidence for both central and peripheral inflammatory changes in dementia with Lewy bodies, with microglial activation occurring early in the disease in key regions known to be associated with pathology, before declining as cognition declines. Raised peripheral cytokines associated with T cell function further suggest a role for the adaptive immune system in the pathogenesis of the disease.

30405395|t|Corroboration of a Major Role for Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 in Alzheimer's Disease.
30405395|a|Strong evidence has emerged recently for the concept that herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) is a major risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). This concept proposes that latent HSV1 in brain of carriers of the type 4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE-epsilon4) is reactivated intermittently by events such as immunosuppression, peripheral infection, and inflammation, the consequent damage accumulating, and culminating eventually in the development of AD. Population data to investigate this epidemiologically, e.g., to find if subjects treated with antivirals might be protected from developing dementia-are available in Taiwan, from the National Health Insurance Research Database, in which 99.9% of the population has been enrolled. This is being extensively mined for information on microbial infections and disease. Three publications have now appeared describing data on the development of senile dementia (SD), and the treatment of those with marked overt signs of disease caused by varicella zoster virus (VZV), or by HSV. The striking results show that the risk of SD is much greater in those who are HSV-seropositive than in seronegative subjects, and that antiviral treatment causes a dramatic decrease in number of subjects who later develop SD. It should be stressed that these results apply only to those with severe cases of HSV1 or VZV infection, but when considered with the over 150 publications that strongly support an HSV1 role in AD, they greatly justify usage of antiherpes antivirals to treat AD. Three other studies are described which directly relate to HSV1 and AD: they deal respectively with lysosomal changes in HSV1-infected cell cultures, with evidence for a role of human herpes virus type 6 and 7 (HHV6 and HHV7) in AD, and viral effects on host gene expression, and with the antiviral characteristics of beta amyloid (Abeta). Three indirectly relevant studies deal respectively with schizophrenia, relating to antiviral treatment to target HSV1, with the likelihood that HSV1 is a cause of fibromyalgia (FM), and with FM being associated with later development of SD. Studies on the link between epilepsy, AD and herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) are described also, as are the possible roles of APOE-epsilon4, HHV6 and HSV1 in epilepsy.

30408495|t|The NLRP3 inflammasome is involved in the neuroprotective mechanism of neural stem cells against microglia-mediated toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells via the attenuation of tau hyperphosphorylation and amyloidogenesis.
30408495|a|The cognitive impairment caused by Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with beta-amyloid (Abeta) and tau proteins, and is accompanied by inflammation. Recently, a novel inflammasome signaling pathway has been uncovered. Inflammasomes are implicated in the execution of inflammatory responses and pyroptotic death leading to neurodegeneration. Thus, the inflammasome signaling pathway could be a potential therapeutic target for AD. Neural stem cells (NSCs) are multipotent cells that can self-renew and differentiate into distinct neural cells. NSC therapy has been considered to be a promising therapeutic approach in protecting the central nervous system and restoring it following damage. However, the mechanisms involved remain unclear. The aims of this study were to investigate the protective effects of NE4C neural stem cells against microglia-mediated neurotoxicity and to explore molecular mechanisms mediating their actions. NE4C decreased the levels of caspase-1 and IL-1beta, and attenuated the level of the NLRP3 inflammasome and its associated protein adapter, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a C-terminal caspase recruitment domain (ASC) in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglial cells, possibly by regulating the phosphorylation of p38alpha MAPK. The conditioned media obtained from co-culture of LPS-stimulated BV2 and NE4C cells exhibited protective effects on SH-SY5Y cells against microglia-mediated neurotoxicity; this was associated with an attenuation of tau phosphorylation and amyloidogenesis and accompanied by down-regulation of GSK-3beta and p38alpha MAPK signalling pathways. In conclusion, the present study suggested that NSC therapy could be a potential strategy against microglia-mediated neurotoxicity. NSCs regulate NLRP3 activation and IL-1beta secretion, which are critical in the initiation of the inflammatory responses, hence preventing the release of neurotoxic pro-inflammatory factors by microglia. This eventually reduces tau hyperphosphylation and amyloidogenesis, possibly through the regulation of GSK-3beta and p38alpha MAPK signalling pathways, and thus protects SH-SY5Y cells against microglia-mediated neurotoxicity.

30409906|t|Coagulation factor XIIIa cross-links amyloid beta into dimers and oligomers and to blood proteins.
30409906|a|In cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), the amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide deposits along the vascular lumen, leading to degeneration and dysfunction of surrounding tissues. Activated coagulation factor XIIIa (FXIIIa) covalently cross-links proteins in blood and vasculature, such as in blood clots and on the extracellular matrix. Although FXIIIa co-localizes with Abeta in CAA, the ability of FXIIIa to cross-link Abeta has not been demonstrated. Using Western blotting, kinetic assays, and microfluidic analyses, we show that FXIIIa covalently cross-links Abeta40 into dimers and oligomers (k cat/Km = 1.5 x 105 m-1s-1), as well as to fibrin, platelet proteins, and blood clots under flow in vitro Abeta40 also increased the stiffness of platelet-rich plasma clots in the presence of FXIIIa. These results suggest that FXIIIa-mediated cross-linking may contribute to the formation of Abeta deposits in CAA and Alzheimer's disease.

30412489|t|Epitomic Characterization of the Specificity of the Anti-Amyloid Abeta Monoclonal Antibodies 6E10 and 4G8.
30412489|a|The monoclonal antibodies 6E10 and 4G8 are among the first anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies against Abeta and the most widely used antibodies in Alzheimer's disease research. Although the epitopes for 6E10 and 4G8 have been reported to correspond to residues 1-16 and 17-24, a more recent high-resolution mapping approach indicates that 6E10 maps to residues 4-10 while 4G8 maps to residues 18-23. To characterize the binding specificity of both antibodies in greater detail, we used immunoselection of random sequences from phage display library followed by deep sequencing and analysis of resulting patterns from thousands of immunoselected sequences. We found that the minimum sequence required for 6E10 binding is R-x-D with over half (53%) of the immunoselected sequences conforming to this pattern. The vast majority of these sequences contain an H at position x (R-H-D), corresponding to residues 5-7 of the Abeta target sequences, but Y is also permitted at this position in a minority of sequences. For 4G8 we found that the most frequent pattern is F-x-A contained in approximately 30% of the sequences, followed by F-A, L-x(3)-A, L-x-F, and F-F each accounting for approximately 18% of the sequences. The F-x-A motif also occurs in islet amyloid poly peptide which may explain why 4G8 also recognizes amyloid fibrils of this peptide. Immunoselection of random sequences and deep sequencing may also be a facile and efficient means of determining residues critical for antibody binding and validating the specificity of monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antisera.

30412495|t|Utility of an Alzheimer's Disease Risk-Weighted Polygenic Risk Score for Predicting Rates of Cognitive Decline in Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease: A Prospective Longitudinal Study.
30412495|a|BACKGROUND: With the exception of APOE, genetic variants associated with increased Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk are characterized by small effect sizes. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) have shown utility in predicting AD risk; however, their utility for predicting decline in cognition at preclinical stages of AD is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To validate associations of a 22-variant AD-risk-weighted PRS with AD risk and related biomarkers and to assess its utility to predict cognitive decline. METHODS: The PRS was evaluated with respect to brain amyloid-beta (Abeta) burden, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta42, total-tau, and phospho-tau, and decline in cognition in 643 (570 cognitively normal (CN), 73 AD) PET-imaged participants from the longitudinal Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) Study of Ageing. Cognition was assessed using three composite measures; global cognition, verbal episodic memory, and a Pre-Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite (PACC). RESULTS: PRS, both with and without APOE, were positively correlated with brain Abeta burden, CSF total-tau, and phospho-tau in CN older adults. Further, in CN biomarker positive (Abetahigh) participants, significant associations were observed with baseline and longitudinal cognition. However, this association was not observed after the removal of APOE. Partitioning the PRS into quartiles revealed that the PRS associations with cognitive decline in Abetahigh CN older adults is due to a saturating effect of APOE genotype. CONCLUSIONS: An AD-risk-weighted PRS is associated with cognitive decline in CN older adults. However, this association is absent when APOE genotype is excluded from the PRS, suggesting that associations with cognitive decline in this model of polygenic risk are driven by APOE genotype alone. Further research is needed to define appropriate PRSs with greater utility for predicting preclinical AD cognitive decline.

30412496|t|New Insights into the Spontaneous Human Alzheimer's Disease-Like Model Octodon degus: Unraveling Amyloid-beta Peptide Aggregation and Age-Related Amyloid Pathology.
30412496|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia worldwide. Despite advances in our understanding of the molecular milieu driving AD pathophysiology, no effective therapy is currently available. Moreover, various clinical trials have continued to fail, suggesting that our approach to AD must be revised. Accordingly, the development and validation of new models are highly desirable. Over the last decade, we have been working with Octodon degus (degu), a Chilean rodent, which spontaneously develops AD-like neuropathology, including increased amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregates, tau hyperphosphorylation, and postsynaptic dysfunction. However, for proper validation of degu as an AD model, the aggregation properties of its Abeta peptide must be analyzed. Thus, in this study, we examined the capacity of the degu Abeta peptide to aggregate in vitro. Then, we analyzed the age-dependent variation in soluble Abeta levels in the hippocampus and cortex of third- to fifth-generation captive-born degu. We also assessed the appearance and spatial distribution of amyloid plaques in O. degus and compared them with the plaques in two AD transgenic mouse models. In agreement with our previous studies, degu Abeta was able to aggregate, forming fibrillar species in vitro. Furthermore, amyloid plaques appeared in the anterior brain structures of O. degus at approximately 32 months of age and in the whole brain at 56 months, along with concomitant increases in Abeta levels and the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio, indicating that O. degus spontaneously develops AD-like pathology earlier than other spontaneous models. Based on these results, we can confirm that O. degus constitutes a valuable model to improve AD research.

30413735|t|Amyloid precursor protein-fragments-containing inclusions in cardiomyocytes with basophilic degeneration and its association with cerebral amyloid angiopathy and myocardial fibrosis.
30413735|a|Cardiomyopathies with intracellular inclusions are a distinct subset of cardiomyopathies whereas basophilic degeneration (BD) of the heart describes inclusions in cardiomyocytes of the aging heart, which have not yet been related to a specific disease condition or to a distinct type of protein inclusion. To address the question whether BD represents a specific pathological feature and whether it is linked to a distinct disease condition we studied 62 autopsy cases. BD inclusions exhibited an immunohistochemical staining pattern related to glycosylated, delta- or eta-secretase-derived N-terminal cleavage products of the amyloid precursor protein (sAPPdelta/eta) or shorter fragments of sAPPeta. BD aggregates were found in the myocardium of both ventricles and atria with highest amounts in the atria and lowest in the interventricular septum. The frequency of BD-lesions correlated with age, degree of myocardial fibrosis in individuals with arterial hypertension, and the severity of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). The intracytoplasmic deposition of N-terminal sAPPdelta/eta fragments in BD indicates a specific inclusion body pathology related to APP metabolism. The correlation with the severity of CAA, which is related to the APP-derived amyloid beta-protein, supports this point of view and suggests a possible link between myocardial and cerebrovascular APP-related lesions.

30413934|t|Dissecting the genetic relationship between cardiovascular risk factors and Alzheimer's disease.
30413934|a|Cardiovascular (CV)- and lifestyle-associated risk factors (RFs) are increasingly recognized as important for Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Beyond the epsilon4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE), comparatively little is known about whether CV-associated genes also increase risk for AD. Using large genome-wide association studies and validated tools to quantify genetic overlap, we systematically identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) jointly associated with AD and one or more CV-associated RFs, namely body mass index (BMI), type 2 diabetes (T2D), coronary artery disease (CAD), waist hip ratio (WHR), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). In fold enrichment plots, we observed robust genetic enrichment in AD as a function of plasma lipids (TG, TC, LDL, and HDL); we found minimal AD genetic enrichment conditional on BMI, T2D, CAD, and WHR. Beyond APOE, at conjunction FDR < 0.05 we identified 90 SNPs on 19 different chromosomes that were jointly associated with AD and CV-associated outcomes. In meta-analyses across three independent cohorts, we found four novel loci within MBLAC1 (chromosome 7, meta-p = 1.44 x 10-9), MINK1 (chromosome 17, meta-p = 1.98 x 10-7) and two chromosome 11 SNPs within the MTCH2/SPI1 region (closest gene = DDB2, meta-p = 7.01 x 10-7 and closest gene = MYBPC3, meta-p = 5.62 x 10-8). In a large 'AD-by-proxy' cohort from the UK Biobank, we replicated three of the four novel AD/CV pleiotropic SNPs, namely variants within MINK1, MBLAC1, and DDB2. Expression of MBLAC1, SPI1, MINK1 and DDB2 was differentially altered within postmortem AD brains. Beyond APOE, we show that the polygenic component of AD is enriched for lipid-associated RFs. We pinpoint a subset of cardiovascular-associated genes that strongly increase the risk for AD. Our collective findings support a disease model in which cardiovascular biology is integral to the development of clinical AD in a subset of individuals.

30414017|t|Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 Alleviates Expression of Abeta1-40 and alpha-, beta-, and gamma-Secretases in the Cortex and Hippocampus of APP/PS1 Double Transgenic Mice.
30414017|a|To examine the effect of subcutaneous injection of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) on the expression of the amyloid protein (Abeta1-40), alpha-secretase (ADAM10), beta-secretase (BACE1), and gamma-secretase (PS1) in APP/PS1 double transgenic mice. APP/PS1 double transgenic mice and wild-type mice were divided into wild-type group, wild-type therapy group, transgenome group, and transgenic therapy group. Subcutaneous injection of IGF-1 (50 mug/kg day) was administered once daily to the wild-type therapy group and transgenic therapy group for 8 weeks, respectively. The expression of the Abeta1-40 in the cortex and hippocampus was detected by immunohistochemistry 8 weeks after administration. The levels of Abeta1-40, DAM10, BACE1, and PS1 were analysed by Western blot. The expression of the Abeta1-40 in the cortex of the gene therapy group was significantly lower than that of the transgenome group (p < 0.05). In APP/PS1 double transgenic mice, BACE1 expression was markedly higher in both the hippocampus (p < 0.001, p = 0.00009) and the cortex (p = 0.001), compared to that of the wild-type mice. The treatment of IGF-1 markedly reduced ADAM10 expression in the hippocampus in both transgenic mice and wild-type mice (p < 0.05), whereas the treatment mainly decreased BACE1 expression in transgenic mice but not in the wild-type mice (p < 0.05). No significant differences in PS1 levels were detected in all groups. IGF decreased Abeta1-40 over-expression in the cortex and hippocampus and might inhibit the damage induced by Abeta1-40 in APP/PS1 double transgenic mice. Our study suggests that IGF-1 should inhibit Abeta production through alpha-secretase and beta-secretase but not gamma-secretase.

30414941|t|Poly(ADP-ribosylated) proteins in beta-amyloid peptide-stimulated microglial cells.
30414941|a|Amyloid-treated microglia prime and sustain neuroinflammatory processes in the central nervous system activating different signalling pathways inside the cells. Since a key role for PARP-1 has been demonstrated in inflammation and in neurodegeneration, we investigated PARylated proteins in resting and in beta-amyloid peptide treated BV2 microglial cells. A total of 1158 proteins were identified by mass spectrometry with 117 specifically modified in the amyloid-treated cells. Intervention of PARylation on the proteome of microglia showed to be widespread in different cellular districts and to affect various cellular pathways, highlighting the role of this dynamic post-translational modification in cellular regulation. Ubiquitination is one of the more enriched pathways, encompassing PARylated proteins like NEDD4, an E3 ubiquitine ligase and USP10, a de-ubiquitinase, both associated with intracellular responses induced by beta-amyloid peptide challenge. PARylation of NEDD4 may be involved in the recruiting of this protein to the plasma membrane where it regulates the endocytosis of AMPA receptors, whereas USP10 may be responsible for the increase of p53 levels in amyloid stimulated microglia. Unfolded protein response and Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress pathways, strictly correlated with the Ubiquitination process, also showed enrichment in PARylated proteins. PARylation may thus represent one of the molecular switches responsible for the transition of microglia towards the inflammatory microglia phenotype, a pivotal player in brain diseases including neurodegenerative processes. The establishment of trials with PARP inhibitors to test their efficacy in the containment of neurodegenerative diseases may be envisaged.

30415998|t|Complement C3aR Inactivation Attenuates Tau Pathology and Reverses an Immune Network Deregulated in Tauopathy Models and Alzheimer's Disease.
30415998|a|Strong evidence implicates the complement pathway as an important contributor to amyloid pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the role of complement in tau modulation remains unclear. Here we show that the expression of C3 and C3a receptor (C3aR1) are positively correlated with cognitive decline and Braak staging in human AD brains. Deletion of C3ar1 in PS19 mice results in the rescue of tau pathology and attenuation of neuroinflammation, synaptic deficits, and neurodegeneration. Through RNA sequencing and cell-type-specific transcriptomic analysis, we identify a C3aR-dependent transcription factor network that regulates a reactive glial switch whose inactivation ameliorates disease-associated microglia and neurotoxic astrocyte signatures. Strikingly, this C3aR network includes multiple genes linked to late-onset AD. Mechanistically, we identify STAT3 as a direct target of C3-C3aR signaling that functionally mediates tau pathogenesis. All together our findings demonstrate a crucial role for activation of the C3-C3aR network in mediating neuroinflammation and tau pathology.

30417362|t|Abeta stimulates microglial activation through antizyme-dependent downregulation of ornithine decarboxylase.
30417362|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders. Its pathology is associated with the deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta), an abnormal extracellular peptide. Moreover, its pathological progression is closely accompanied by neuroinflammation. Specifically, Abeta-associated microglial overactivation may have the central role in AD pathogenesis. Interestingly, arginine metabolism may contribute to the equilibrium between M1 and M2 microglia. However, little is known about the involvement of arginine metabolism in Abeta-induced microglial neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity. Moreover, the underlying mechanism by which Abeta induces the transition of microglia to the M1 phenotype remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of Abeta in mediating microglial activation and polarization both in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrated that under the Abeta treatment, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), a rate-limiting enzyme in the regulation of arginine catabolism, regulates microglial activation by altering the antizyme (AZ) + 1 ribosomal frameshift. Furthermore, the restoration of ODC protein expression levels has profound effects on inhibition of Abeta-induced M1 markers and thus attenuates microglial-mediated cytotoxicity. Altogether, our findings suggested that Abeta may contribute to M1-like activation by disrupting the balance between ODC and AZ in microglia.

30419228|t|Learnings about the complexity of extracellular tau aid development of a blood-based screen for Alzheimer's disease.
30419228|a|INTRODUCTION: The tau protein plays a central role in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and there is huge interest in measuring tau in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). METHODS: We developed a set of immunoassays to measure tau in specimens from humans diagnosed based on current best clinical and CSF biomarker criteria. RESULTS: In CSF, mid-region- and N-terminal-detected tau predominated and rose in disease. In plasma, an N-terminal assay (NT1) detected elevated levels of tau in AD and AD-mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Plasma NT1 measurements separated controls from AD-MCI (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.88) and AD (AUC = 0.96) in a discovery cohort and in a Validation Cohort (with AUCs = 0.79 and 0.75, respectively). DISCUSSION: The forms of tau in CSF and plasma are distinct, but in each specimen type, the levels of certain fragments are increased in AD. Measurement of plasma NT1 tau should be aggressively pursued as a potential blood-based screening test for AD/AD-MCI.

30420035|t|Rate of beta-amyloid accumulation varies with baseline amyloid burden: Implications for anti-amyloid drug trials.
30420035|a|INTRODUCTION: This study examined a longitudinal trajectory of beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation at the predementia stage of Alzheimer's disease in the context of clinical trials. METHODS: Analyzed were baseline (BL) and 2 years' follow-up 18F-florbetapir positron emission tomography data of 246 Abeta-positive subjects with normal cognition and mild cognitive impairment. We studied the relationship between annual accumulation rates of 18F-florbetapir and BL standard uptake value ratios in whole gray matter (SUVRGM). RESULTS: Subjects with BL SUVRGM of 0.56 to 0.92 (n = 134) appeared to accumulate Abeta approximately 1.5 times faster than remaining subjects. In subjects with SUVRGM above 0.95, most regions with the highest annual accumulation rate were outside the established set of Alzheimer's disease typical regions. CONCLUSION: There are global and regional variations in annual accumulation rate at the predementia stage of Alzheimer's disease. When taken into account, the sample size in anti-amyloid trials can be substantially reduced. Critically, treated and placebo groups should be matched for BL SUVRGM.

30421246|t|Trigonelline protects hippocampus against intracerebral Abeta(1-40) as a model of Alzheimer's disease in the rat: insights into underlying mechanisms.
30421246|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder and the most common phenotype of dementia. Trigonelline is an alkaloid found in medicinal plants such as fenugreek seeds and coffee beans with neuroprotective potential and according to existing evidences, a favorable agent for treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, the possible protective effect of trigonelline against intracerebral Abeta(1-40) as a model of AD in the rat was investigated. For induction of AD, aggregated A(1-40) (10 mug/2  l for each side) was bilaterally microinjected into the hippocampal CA1 area. Trigonelline was administered p.o. at a dose of 100 mg/kg. The results showed that trigonelline pretreatment of Abeta-microinjected rats significantly improves spatial recognition memory in Y maze and performance in novel object recognition (NOR) task, mitigates hippocampal malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and improves mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), glutathione (GSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) with no significant change of catalase activity, nitrite level, caspase 3 activity, and DNA fragmentation. Additionally, trigonelline ameliorated hippocampal levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), S100b, cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox2), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) with no significant alteration of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). In addition, trigonelline pretreatment prevented loss of hippocampal CA1 neurons in Abeta-microinjected group. Therefore, our results suggest that trigonelline pretreatment in Abeta model of AD could improve cognition and is capable to alleviate neuronal loss through suppressing oxidative stress, astrocyte activity, and inflammation and also through preservation of mitochondrial integrity.

30426203|t|The metalloprotease ADAMTS4 generates N-truncated Abeta4-x species and marks oligodendrocytes as a source of amyloidogenic peptides in Alzheimer's disease.
30426203|a|Brain accumulation and aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides is a critical step in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Full-length Abeta peptides (mainly Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42) are produced through sequential proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretases. However, studies of autopsy brain samples from AD patients have demonstrated that a large fraction of insoluble Abeta peptides are truncated at the N-terminus, with Abeta4-x peptides being particularly abundant. Abeta4-x peptides are highly aggregation prone, but their origin and any proteases involved in their generation are unknown. We have identified a recognition site for the secreted metalloprotease ADAMTS4 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 4) in the Abeta peptide sequence, which facilitates Abeta4-x peptide generation. Inducible overexpression of ADAMTS4 in HEK293 cells resulted in the secretion of Abeta4-40 but unchanged levels of Abeta1-x peptides. In the 5xFAD mouse model of amyloidosis, Abeta4-x peptides were present not only in amyloid plaque cores and vessel walls, but also in white matter structures co-localized with axonal APP. In the ADAMTS4-/- knockout background, Abeta4-40 levels were reduced confirming a pivotal role of ADAMTS4 in vivo. Surprisingly, in the adult murine brain, ADAMTS4 was exclusively expressed in oligodendrocytes. Cultured oligodendrocytes secreted a variety of Abeta species, but Abeta4-40 peptides were absent in cultures derived from ADAMTS4-/- mice indicating that the enzyme was essential for Abeta4-x production in this cell type. These findings establish an enzymatic mechanism for the generation of Abeta4-x peptides. They further identify oligodendrocytes as a source of these highly amyloidogenic Abeta peptides.

30427370|t|Molecular rotors report on changes in live cell plasma membrane microviscosity upon interaction with beta-amyloid aggregates.
30427370|a|Amyloid deposits of aggregated beta-amyloid Abeta(1-42) peptides are a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Abeta(1-42) aggregates are known to induce biophysical alterations in cells, including disruption of plasma membranes. We investigated the microviscosity of plasma membranes upon interaction with oligomeric and fibrillar forms of Abeta(1-42). Viscosity-sensing fluorophores termed molecular rotors were utilised to directly measure the microviscosities of giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs) and plasma membranes of live SH-SY5Y and HeLa cells. The fluorescence lifetimes of membrane-inserting BODIPY-based molecular rotors revealed a decrease in bilayer microviscosity upon incubation with Abeta(1-42) oligomers, while fibrillar Abeta(1-42) did not significantly affect the microviscosity of the bilayer. In addition, we demonstrate that the neuroprotective peptide H3 counteracts the microviscosity change induced by Abeta(1-42) oligomers, suggesting the utility of H3 as a neuroprotective therapeutic agent in neurodegenerative disorders and indicating that ligand-induced membrane stabilisation may be a possible mechanism of neuroprotection during neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

30429473|t|Presenilin-mediated cleavage of APP regulates synaptotagmin-7 and presynaptic plasticity.
30429473|a|Mutations of the intramembrane protease presenilin (PS) or of its main substrate, the amyloid precursor protein (APP), cause early-onset form of Alzheimer disease. PS and APP interact with proteins of the neurotransmitter release machinery without identified functional consequences. Here we report that genetic deletion of PS markedly decreases the presynaptic levels of the Ca2+ sensor synaptotagmin-7 (Syt7) leading to impaired synaptic facilitation and replenishment of synaptic vesicles. The regulation of Syt7 expression by PS occurs post-transcriptionally and depends on gamma-secretase proteolytic activity. It requires the substrate APP as revealed by the combined genetic invalidation of APP and PS1, and in particular the APP-Cterminal fragments which interact with Syt7 and accumulate in synaptic terminals under pharmacological or genetic inhibition of gamma-secretase. Thus, we uncover a role of PS in presynaptic mechanisms, through APP cleavage and regulation of Syt7, that highlights aberrant synaptic vesicle processing as a possible new pathway in AD.

30430632|t|The recency ratio is related to CSF amyloid beta 1-42 levels in MCI-AD.
30430632|a|OBJECTIVE: As anti-amyloid therapeutic interventions shift from enrolling patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia to individuals with pre-clinical disease, the need for sensitive measures that allow for non-invasive, fast, disseminable, and cost-effective identification of preclinical status increases in importance. The recency ratio (Rr) is a memory measure that relies on analysis of serial position performance, which has been found to predict cognitive decline and conversion to early mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The aim of this study was to test Rr's sensitivity to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of the core AD biomarkers in individuals with MCI-AD and controls. METHODS: Baseline data from 126 (110 controls and 16 MCI-AD) participants from the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center were analysed. Partial correlations adjusting for demographics were carried out between CSF measure of amyloid beta (Abeta40, Abeta42, and the 40/42 ratio) and tau (total and phosphorylated), and memory measures (Rr, delayed recall, and total recall) derived from the Rey's Auditory Verbal Learning Test. RESULTS: Results indicated that Rr was the most sensitive memory score to Abeta42 levels in MCI-AD, while no memory score correlated significantly with any biomarker in controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that Rr is a sensitive cognitive index of underlying amyloid beta pathology in MCI-AD.

30430925|t|The protective mechanism underlying phenylethanoid glycosides (PHG) actions on synaptic plasticity in rat Alzheimer's disease model induced by beta amyloid 1-42.
30430925|a|Phenylethanoid glycosides (PHG), derived from Herba cistanche, were found to exert protective effects on cognitive dysfunctions by improving synaptic plasticity in Alzheimer's disease (AD) rat model. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects of PHG on synaptic plasticity remain to be determined. Thus the aim of this study was to examine the influence of PHG on synaptic plasticity in male AD rat model induced by bilateral central nervous system ventricle injections of beta amyloid 1-42 oligomers (Abeta1-42). The following parameters were measured: (1) number of intact pyramidal cells in hippocampal CA1 region by Nissl staining, (2) post synaptic density 95 (PSD-95), phosphorylated N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-1(p-NMDAR1) and (3) phosphorylated Tau protein (p-Tau) by immunohistochemistry and western blot. In addition, the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were determined. Abeta1-42 lowered the number of intact pyramidal cells in hippocampal CA1 region. In contrast, treatment with PHG significantly elevated this cell number. Abeta1-42 significantly diminished protein expression levels of PSD-95 accompanied by elevated protein expression levels of p-NMDAR1 and p-Tau. PHG markedly increased protein expression levels of PSD-95, but significantly reduced protein expression levels of p-NMDAR1 and p-Tau. Further, Abeta1-42 markedly increased MDA content concomitantly with reduced activities of SOD and GSH-Px. PHG significantly decreased MDA content accompanied by elevated activities of SOD and GSH-Px. Data suggest that the protective effects of PHG on synaptic plasticity may involve inhibition of cytotoxicity-mediated by Abeta-1-42 administration and reduction of oxidant stress.

30442346|t|Caliphruria subedentata (Amaryllidaceae) decreases genotoxicity and cell death induced by beta-amyloid peptide in SH-SY5Y cell line.
30442346|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by neuritic plaques (NPs), and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). beta-Amyloid peptide 1-4 2 (Abeta(1-42)) is the principal component of NPs and is associated with oxidative stress, as well as dysfunction of cholinergic neurotransmission system and cell death. Nevertheless, one of the most promising therapeutic approaches for patients with AD is based on the pharmacological intervention to increases acetylcholine levels and reduces oxidative stress in AD brain. Previous studies have indicated that alkaloids from Amaryllidaceae family exhibit a wide range of biological activities. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether C. subedentata extract may modulate Abeta(1-42)- induced genotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cell line. Here, we conducted a set of bioassays to measure: viability, clonogenic survival, cell death, chromosome damage and DNA strand breaks. The results showed that Abeta(1-42) significantly inhibited cell viability through necrosis rather than apoptosis, increased the percentage of DNA damage and caused mitochondrial morphological alterations. Treatment with the C. subedentata extract led to a significant recovery of cell survival, decreased necrotic cell death and exerted an induction of antigenotoxic effects; additionally, the extract caigused inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The present study confirms neuroprotective activities of C. subedentata belonging Amaryllidaceae family and provide a novel information to clarify the mechanisms by which the extracts decrease DNA damage levels induced by Abeta(1-42).

30442495|t|Toxic Protein Spread in Neurodegeneration: Reality versus Fantasy.
30442495|a|Over the past decade, the importance of the propagation of amyloidogenic proteins such as alpha-synuclein and tau in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases has been supported by numerous neuropathological and experimental studies. While these proteins behave similarly to prions, recent evidence suggests the existence of fundamental differences, as they can propagate in the absence of endogenous template, they do not exhibit a strict 'strain' behavior, and they may not be transmissible between individuals. We therefore propose to name these proteins 'prionoids'. In this review we critically assess the extent of the overlap between these two entities and evaluate how the propagation of prionoids can fit into the wider system dysfunction seen in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.

30442978|t|Amyloid beta toxic conformer has dynamic localization in the human inferior parietal cortex in absence of amyloid plaques.
30442978|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Nevertheless, its distribution and clearance before Abeta plaque formation needs to be elucidated. Using an optimized immunofluorescent staining method, we examined the distribution of Abeta in the post-mortem parietal cortex of 35 subjects, 30 to 65 years of age, APOE epsilon3/epsilon3, without AD lesions. We used 11A1, an antibody against an Abeta conformer which forms neurotoxic oligomers. 11A1 immunoreactivity (IR) was present in cortical neurons, pericapillary spaces, astrocytes and the extracellular compartment at 30 years of age. The percentage of neurons with 11A1 IR did not change with age, but the number and percentage of astrocytes with 11A1 IR gradually increased. Notably, the percentage of pericapillary spaces labeled with 11A1 IR declined significantly in the 5th decade of the life, at the same time that 11A1 IR increased in the extracellular space. Our findings indicate that the Abeta toxic conformer is normally present in various cell types and brain parenchyma, and appears to be constitutively produced, degraded, and cleared from the inferior parietal cortex. The decrease in pericapillary Abeta and the concomitant increase of extracellular Abeta may reflect an age-associated impairment in Abeta clearance from the brain.

30444372|t|Nanocomposites Inhibit the Formation, Mitigate the Neurotoxicity, and Facilitate the Removal of beta-Amyloid Aggregates in Alzheimer's Disease Mice.
30444372|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible brain disorder. Recent studies revealed the pivotal role of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in AD. However, there is no conclusive indication that the existing therapeutic strategies exerted any effect on the mitigation of Abeta-induced neurotoxicity and the elimination of Abeta aggregates simultaneously in vivo. Herein, we developed a novel nanocomposite that can eliminate toxic Abeta aggregates and mitigate Abeta-induced neurotoxicity in AD mice. This nanocomposite was designed to be a small-sized particle (14 +- 4 nm) with Abeta-binding peptides (KLVFF) integrated on the surface. The nanocomposite was prepared by wrapping a protein molecule with a cross-linked KLVFF-containing polymer layer synthesized by in situ polymerization. The presence of the nanocomposite remarkably changed the morphology of Abeta aggregates, which led to the formation of Abeta/nanocomposite coassembled nanoclusters instead of Abeta oligomers. With the reduction of the pathological Abeta oligomers, the nanocomposites attenuated the Abeta-induced neuron damages, regained endocranial microglia's capability to phagocytose Abeta, and eventually protected hippocampal neurons against apoptosis. Thus, we anticipate that the small-sized nanocomposite will potentially offer a feasible strategy in the development of novel AD treatments.

30447302|t|Gallic acid disruption of Abeta1-42 aggregation rescues cognitive decline of APP/PS1 double transgenic mouse.
30447302|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment represents one of the largest unmet medical needs. Developing small molecules targeting Abeta aggregation is an effective approach to prevent and treat AD. Here, we show that gallic acid (GA), a naturally occurring polyphenolic small molecule rich in grape seeds and fruits, has the capacity to alleviate cognitive decline of APP/PS1 transgenic mouse through reduction of Abeta1-42 aggregation and neurotoxicity. Oral administration of GA not only improved the spatial reference memory and spatial working memory of 4-month-old APP/PS1 mice, but also significantly reduced the more severe deficits developed in the 9-month-old APP/PS1 mice in terms of spatial learning, reference memory, short-term recognition and spatial working memory. The hippocampal long-term-potentiation (LTP) was also significantly elevated in the GA-treated 9-month-old APP/PS1 mice with increased expression of synaptic marker proteins. Evidence from atomic force microscopy (AFM), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence densitometry analyses showed that GA significantly reduces Abeta1-42 aggregation both in vitro and in vivo. Further, pre-incubating GA with oligomeric Abeta1-42 reduced Abeta1-42-mediated intracellular calcium influx and neurotoxicity. Molecular docking studies identified that the 3,4,5-hydroxyle groups of GA were essential in noncovalently stabilizing GA binding to the Lys28-Ala42 salt bridge and the -COOH group is critical for disrupting the salt bridge of Abeta1-42. The predicated covalent interaction through Schiff-base formation between the carbonyl group of the oxidized product and epsilon-amino group of Lys16 is also critical for the disruption of Abeta1-42 S-shaped triple-beta-motif and toxicity. Together, these studies demonstrated that GA can be further developed as a drug to treat AD through disrupting the formation of Abeta1-42 aggregation.

30447377|t|Association of CSF CD40 levels and synaptic degeneration across the Alzheimer's disease spectrum.
30447377|a|The CD40 pathway has been implicated in microglial activation, which is considered as a key factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the association of CSF CD40 and synaptic degeneration in living human is not clear. A total of 294 subjects with different severities of cognitive impairments were included in this study: 84 participants with normal cognition, 143 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 67 patients with mild AD. Levels of CD40 in CSF were compared among the three groups. Further, several linear regression models were conducted to explore the associations of CSF CD40 and neurogranin levels (reflecting synaptic degeneration) when controlling for age, gender, educational attainment, APOE4 genotype, clinical diagnosis, CSF Abeta42 and tau proteins. We found that CSF CD40 levels were significantly decreased in patients with mild AD compared with healthy controls and MCI patients (control vs. AD, p = 0.0026; MCI vs. AD, p = 0.0268). However, there were no significant differences in CSF CD40 levels between controls and patients with MCI (p = 0.37). In addition, CSF CD40 levels were associated with neurogranin in the pooled sample when controlling for age, gender, educational attainment, APOE4 genotype and diagnosis. In summary, our findings support the notion that the CD40 pathway may contribute to an important mechanism underlying synaptic degeneration in AD.

30448281|t|Soluble LR11 competes with amyloid beta in binding to cerebrospinal fluid-high-density lipoprotein.
30448281|a|BACKGROUND: LR11 is a member of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family with high expression in neurons. Some cell surface LR11 is cleaved and secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as soluble LR11 (sLR11). Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), particularly apolipoprotein E4 carriers, have high CSF-sLR11 and low CSF-amyloid beta (Abeta) concentrations. Therefore, we assessed whether sLR11 is bound to CSF-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and whether sLR11 competes with Abeta in binding to apoE in CSF-HDL. METHODS: We measured CSF-sLR11 concentrations (50 controls and 16 patients with AD) using enzyme immunoassay. sLR11 and apoE distribution in the CSF was evaluated using non-denaturing two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (N-2DGE). ApoE bound to sLR11 or Abeta was identified using co-immunoprecipitation assay. RESULTS: CSF-sLR11 concentrations were higher in patients with AD than controls (adjusted for sLR11 using phospholipid). N-2DGE analysis showed that sLR11 and Abeta comigrated with a large apoE-containing CSF-HDL. Moreover, fewer apoE was bound to Abeta when a higher amount of apoE was bound to sLR11 in patients with AD who presented with epsilon4/4. CONCLUSION: sLR11 binds to CSF-HDL and competes with Abeta in binding to apoE in CSF-HDL, indicating that sLR11 affects Abeta clearance via CSF-HDL.

30448407|t|Elevated Membrane Cholesterol Disrupts Lysosomal Degradation to Induce beta-Amyloid Accumulation: The Potential Mechanism Underlying Augmentation of beta-Amyloid Pathology by Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
30448407|a|The endocytic membrane trafficking system is altered in the brains of early-stage Alzheimer disease (AD) patients, and endocytic disturbance affects the metabolism of beta-amyloid (Abeta) protein, a key molecule in AD pathogenesis. It is widely accepted that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the strongest risk factors for development of AD. Supporting this link, experimentally induced T2DM enhances AD pathology in various animal models. Spontaneous T2DM also enhances Abeta pathology with severe endocytic pathology, even in nonhuman primate brains. However, it remains unclear how T2DM accelerates Abeta pathology. Herein, we demonstrate that cholesterol metabolism-related protein levels are increased and that membrane cholesterol level is elevated in spontaneous T2DM-affected cynomolgus monkey brains. Moreover, in vitro studies that manipulate cellular cholesterol reveal that elevated membrane cholesterol disrupts lysosomal degradation and enhances chemical-induced endocytic disturbance, resulting in great accumulation of Abeta in Neuro2a cells. These findings suggest that an alteration of cerebral cholesterol metabolism may be responsible for augmentation of Abeta pathology in T2DM-affected brains, which, in turn, may increase the risk for developing AD.

30452955|t|Amyloid-ss promotes neurotoxicity by Cdk5-induced p53 stabilization.
30452955|a|Neurodegeneration in selective brain areas underlies the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although oligomeric amyloid-beta (Abeta) plays a central role in the AD pathogenesis, the mechanism of neuronal loss in response to Abeta remains elusive. The p53 tumor suppressor protein, a key regulator of cell apoptosis, has been described to accumulate in affected brain areas from AD patients. However, whether p53 plays any role in AD pathogenesis remains unknown. To address this issue, here we investigated the involvement of p53 on Ass-induced neuronal apoptosis. We found that exposure of neurons to oligomers of the amyloidogenic fragment 25-35 of the Ass peptide (Abeta25-35) promoted p53 protein phosphorylation and stabilization, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal apoptosis. To address the underlying mechanism, we focused on cyclin dependent kinase-5 (Cdk5), a known p53-phosphorylating kinase. The results revealed that Abeta25-35 treatment activated Cdk5, and that inhibiting Cdk5 activity prevented p53 protein stabilization. Furthermore, Abeta25-35-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal apoptosis were prevented by both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of either p53 or Cdk5 activities. This effect was mimicked with the full-length peptide Abeta1-42. To confirm the mechanism in vivo, Abeta25-35 was stereotaxically injected in the cerebral right ventricle of mice, a treatment that caused p53 protein accumulation, dendrite disruption and neuronal death. Furthermore, these effects were prevented in p53 knockout mice or by pharmacologically inhibiting p53. Thus, Abeta25-35 triggers Cdk5 activation to induce p53 phosphorylation and stabilization, which leads to neuronal damage. Inhibition of the Cdk5-p53 pathway may therefore represent a novel therapeutic strategy against Abeta-induced neurodegeneration.

30453234|t|In vivo hippocampal subfield shape related to TDP-43, amyloid beta, and tau pathologies.
30453234|a|Despite advances in the development of biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD), accurate ante-mortem diagnosis remains challenging because a variety of neuropathologic disease states can coexist and contribute to the AD dementia syndrome. Here, we report a neuroimaging study correlating hippocampal deformity with regional AD and transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDA pathology burden. We used hippocampal shape analysis of ante-mortem T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging images of 42 participants from two longitudinal cohort studies conducted by the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center. Surfaces were generated for the whole hippocampus and zones approximating the underlying subfields using a previously developed automated image-segmentation pipeline. Multiple linear regression models were constructed to correlate the shape with pathology measures while accounting for covariates, with relationships mapped out onto hippocampal surface locations. A significant relationship existed between higher paired helical filaments-tau burden and inward hippocampal shape deformity in zones approximating CA1 and subiculum which persisted after accounting for coexisting pathologies. No significant patterns of inward surface deformity were associated with amyloid-beta or transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDA after including covariates. Our findings indicate that hippocampal shape deformity measures in surface zones approximating CA1 may represent a biomarker for postmortem AD pathology.

30453864|t|Time-dependent effect of oligomeric amyloid-beta (1-42)-induced hippocampal neurodegeneration in rat model of Alzheimer's disease.
30453864|a|OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized with an abnormal deposition of insoluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide plaques, tangles formation and synaptic dysfunction. These result in impaired functioning of neuronal circuits and alter the behavioral response owing to activation of neurotransmitter receptors. Recently, it has been implicated that Abeta influences N-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation in AD; however, the molecular mechanism underlying remains unclear. Thus, emerged specific aim to study the time-course effect of oligomeric Abeta(1-42) (oAbeta1-42) on the mRNA expression of genes encoding NMDA and acetylcholine receptors in the rat model of AD. METHODS:  Aggregated forms of synthetic Abeta peptides were injected bilaterally into the intrahippocampal region of rat brain using stereotaxic surgery. Behavioral analysis was performed using eight-arm Radial Arm Maze task at the end of experimental period. Euthanized rat brain hippocampal tissue was used to study the mRNA expression of glutamatergic and cholinergic receptor using semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: oAbeta1-42 decreased the gene expression level of alpha7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and increased the mRNA expression of NMDA receptor 2A, and -2B subunits. In particular, oAbeta1-42 aggregates increased the retention time and altered the behavioral response in rats after 15 days of injection. Further, amyloid-beta1-42 are highly expressed in 15 days after postinjection in hippocampus of adult rats. CONCLUSION: Acute exposure of oAbeta1-42 modulated differential gene expression of glutamatergic and cholinergic receptors in hippocampus of adult rats and is duration dependent reflecting changes in hippocampal circuitry system underlying learning and memory impairments.

30456353|t|Neuronal Abeta42 is enriched in small vesicles at the presynaptic side of synapses.
30456353|a|The amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) is a physiological ubiquitously expressed peptide suggested to be involved in synaptic function, long-term potentiation, and memory function. The 42 amino acid-long variant (Abeta42) forms neurotoxic oligomers and amyloid plaques and plays a key role in the loss of synapses and other pathogenic events of Alzheimer disease. Still, the exact localization of Abeta42 in neurons and at synapses has not been reported. Here, we used super-resolution microscopy and show that Abeta42 was present in small vesicles in presynaptic compartments, but not in postsynaptic compartments, in the neurites of hippocampal neurons. Some of these vesicles appeared to lack synaptophysin, indicating that they differ from the synaptic vesicles responsible for neurotransmitter release. The Abeta42-containing vesicles existed in presynapses connected to stubby spines and mushroom spines, and were also present in immature presynapses. These vesicles were scarce in other parts of the neurites, where Abeta42 was instead present in large, around 200-600 nm, vesicular structures. Three-dimensional super-resolution microscopy confirmed that Abeta42 was present in the presynapse and absent in the postsynapse.

30457145|t|The Alzheimer's disease amyloid-beta peptide affects the size-dynamics of raft-mimicking Lo domains in GM1-containing lipid bilayers.
30457145|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the overproduction of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) which forms fibrils under the influence of raft microdomains containing the ganglioside GM1. Raft-mimicking artificial liquid ordered (Lo) domains containing GM1 enhance amyloid-beta polymerization. Other experiments suggest that Abeta binds preferably to the non-raft liquid disordered (Ld) phase rather than to the Lo phase in the presence of GM1. Here, the interaction of Abeta(1-42) with GM1-containing biphasic Lo-Ld giant vesicles was investigated. Fluorescence colocalisation experiments confirm that Abeta(1-42) binds preferentially to the Ld phase. The effect of Abeta(1-42) on the Lo-Ld size dynamics was studied using photoinduced spinodal decomposition which mimics the nanodomain-microdomain raft coalescence. Abeta affects the kinetics of the coarsening phase and the size of the resulting microdomains. The effect depends on which phase is in a majority: when the Lo microdomains are formed inside an Ld phase, their growth rate becomes slower and their final size smaller in the presence of Abeta(1-42), whereas when the Ld microdomains are formed inside an Lo phase, the growth rate becomes faster and the final size larger. Fluorimetric measurements on large vesicles using the probe Laurdan indicate that Abeta(1-42) binding respectively increases or decreases the packing of the Ld phase in the presence or absence of GM1. The differential effects of Abeta on spinodal decomposition are accordingly interpreted as resulting from distinct effects of the peptide on the Lo-Ld line tension modulated by GM1. Such modulating effect of Abeta on domain dynamics could be important for lipid rafts in signaling disorders in AD as well as in Abeta fibrillation.

30458163|t|Cognitive decline in Tg2576 mice shows sex-specific differences and correlates with cerebral amyloid-beta.
30458163|a|Patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease show a sex-dependent decline of cognitive function. The aim of this investigation was to show these differences in an animal model for Alzheimer's disease and to determine whether this effect is correlated to amyloid-beta-induced pathophysiological changes. Therefore, we assessed cognitive performance with the modified hole-board test in female and male Tg2576 and wild type mice at the age of 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 months and correlated these findings to the total amount of soluble amyloid-beta and insoluble amyloid deposits in the brain. Tg2576 mice perform worse than wild types. Female Tg2576 mice develop an accentuated cognitive impairment (wrong choice total) beginning at the age of 12 months compared to their male littermates. Alterations in the mice's behaviour do not show interference with these deficits. Cognitive impairment is correlated to the amount of soluble amyloid-beta and insoluble amyloid deposits in the brain in a sex-dependent manner.

30459314|t|p66Shc activation promotes increased oxidative phosphorylation and renders CNS cells more vulnerable to amyloid beta toxicity.
30459314|a|A key pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the accumulation of the neurotoxic amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide within the brains of affected individuals. Previous studies have shown that neuronal cells selected for resistance to Abeta toxicity display a metabolic shift from mitochondrial-dependent oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to aerobic glycolysis to meet their energy needs. The Src homology/collagen (Shc) adaptor protein p66Shc is a key regulator of mitochondrial function, ROS production and aging. Moreover, increased expression and activation of p66Shc promotes a shift in the cellular metabolic state from aerobic glycolysis to OXPHOS in cancer cells. Here we evaluated the hypothesis that activation of p66Shc in CNS cells promotes both increased OXPHOS and enhanced sensitivity to Abeta toxicity. The effect of altered p66Shc expression on metabolic activity was assessed in rodent HT22 and B12 cell lines of neuronal and glial origin respectively. Overexpression of p66Shc repressed glycolytic enzyme expression and increased both mitochondrial electron transport chain activity and ROS levels in HT22 cells. The opposite effect was observed when endogenous p66Shc expression was knocked down in B12 cells. Moreover, p66Shc activation in both cell lines increased their sensitivity to Abeta toxicity. Our findings indicate that expression and activation of p66Shc renders CNS cells more sensitive to Abeta toxicity by promoting mitochondrial OXPHOS and ROS production while repressing aerobic glycolysis. Thus, p66Shc may represent a potential therapeutically relevant target for the treatment of AD.

30460364|t|Hyperspectral analysis applied to micro-Brillouin maps of amyloid-beta plaques in Alzheimer's disease brains.
30460364|a|A recent investigation on the architecture and chemical composition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques in ex vivo histological sections of an Abeta-overexpressing transgenic mouse hippocampus has shed light on the infrared light signature of cell-activation related biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease. A correlation was highlighted between the biomechanical properties detected by Brillouin microscopy and the molecular make-up of Abeta plaques provided by FTIR spectroscopic imaging and Raman microscopy (with correlative immunofluorescence imaging) in this animal model of the disease. In the Brillouin spectra of heterogeneous materials such as biomedical samples, peaks are likely the result of multiple contributions, more or less overlaid on a spatial and spectral scale. The ability to disentangle these contributions is very important as it may give access to discrete components that would otherwise be buried within the Brillouin peak envelope. Here, we applied an unsupervised non-negative matrix factorization method to analyse the spontaneous Brillouin microscopy maps of Abeta plaques in transgenic mouse hippocampal sections. The method has already been proven successful in decomposing chemical images and is applied here for the first time to acoustic maps acquired with a Fabry-Perot Brillouin microscope. We extracted and visualised a decrease in tissue rigidity from the core through to the periphery of the plaque, with spatially distinct components that we assigned to specific entities. This work demonstrates that it is possible to reveal the structure and mechanical properties of Abeta plaques, with details visualized by the projection of the mechanical contrast into a few relevant channels.

30463045|t|Neuroprotective role of astaxanthin in hippocampal insulin resistance induced by Abeta peptides in animal model of Alzheimer's disease.
30463045|a|With the constant failure of the clinical trials continuous exploration of a therapeutic target against Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the utmost need. Numerous studies have supported the hypothesis that central insulin resistance plays a significant role in AD. Serine phosphorylation of Insulin Receptor Substarte-1 (IRS-1) has been found to be a contributing factor in neuronal insulin resistance. Astaxanthin (ASX) is xanthophyll carotenoid which has previously demonstrated significant antidiabetic and neuroprotective actions. In the present study, AD was induced by i.c.v administration of Amyloid-beta (1-42) peptides in Wistar rats. After 7 days of recovery, rats were treated with 0.5 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg of ASX orally for 28 days. Behavioral analysis was done in the last week of our experimental study. On the 36th day, rats were sacrificed and their hippocampus were separated from the whole brain, then homogenized and stored for biochemical estimations. ASX significantly and dose-dependently reversed the cognitive and memory impairment, assessed by Morris water maze test and Novel object Recognition test, Abeta (1-42) peptides infused Wistar rats. ASX also significantly attenuated soluble Abeta (1-42) level, IRS-S307 activity, GSK-3beta activity, TNF-alpha level, AChE level, nitrite level and oxidative stress in the hippocampus. Histopathological evaluation, done through H&E and Congo red staining, also demonstrated neuroprotective and anti-amyloidogenic effects of ASX in hippocampus. Our study concludes preventive action of Astaxanthin against hippocampal insulin resistance and Alzheimer's disease complications, supporting potential role of hippocampal insulin resistance targeting against AD.

30464338|t|Somatic APP gene recombination in Alzheimer's disease and normal neurons.
30464338|a|The diversity and complexity of the human brain are widely assumed to be encoded within a constant genome. Somatic gene recombination, which changes germline DNA sequences to increase molecular diversity, could theoretically alter this code but has not been documented in the brain, to our knowledge. Here we describe recombination of the Alzheimer's disease-related gene APP, which encodes amyloid precursor protein, in human neurons, occurring mosaically as thousands of variant 'genomic cDNAs' (gencDNAs). gencDNAs lacked introns and ranged from full-length cDNA copies of expressed, brain-specific RNA splice variants to myriad smaller forms that contained intra-exonic junctions, insertions, deletions, and/or single nucleotide variations. DNA in situ hybridization identified gencDNAs within single neurons that were distinct from wild-type loci and absent from non-neuronal cells. Mechanistic studies supported neuronal 'retro-insertion' of RNA to produce gencDNAs; this process involved transcription, DNA breaks, reverse transcriptase activity, and age. Neurons from individuals with sporadic Alzheimer's disease showed increased gencDNA diversity, including eleven mutations known to be associated with familial Alzheimer's disease that were absent from healthy neurons. Neuronal gene recombination may allow 'recording' of neural activity for selective 'playback' of preferred gene variants whose expression bypasses splicing; this has implications for cellular diversity, learning and memory, plasticity, and diseases of the human brain.

30464477|t|Removal of blood amyloid-beta with hemodialysis reduced brain amyloid-beta, confirmed by brain imaging: a case report.
30464477|a|The accumulation of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) in the brain signifies a major pathological change of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Extracorporeal blood Abeta removal system (E-BARS) has been under development as a tool for enhancing the clearance of Abeta from the brain. Previously, we revealed that dialyzers remove blood Abetas effectively, evoking substantial Abeta influx into the blood during hemodialysis sessions as one form of blood Abeta removal by E-BARS, and that postmortem brains of hemodialysis patients exhibited lower Abeta accumulation. Here, we present a case report of a 77-year-old male patient with end-stage renal failure whose Abeta accumulation in the brain declined by initiating and continuing hemodialysis for 6 months. This report suggests that blood Abeta removal by E-BARS could be an effective therapeutic method for AD.

30465796|t|Mass synaptometry: High-dimensional multi parametric assay for single synapses.
30465796|a|BACKGROUND: Synaptic alterations, especially presynaptic changes, are cardinal features of neurodegenerative diseases and strongly correlate with cognitive decline. NEW METHOD: We report "Mass Synaptometry" for the high-dimensional analysis of individual human synaptosomes, enriched nerve terminals from brain. This method was adapted from cytometry by time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CyTOF), which is commonly used for single-cell analysis of immune and blood cells. RESULT: Here we overcome challenges for single synapse analysis by optimizing synaptosome preparations, generating a 'SynTOF panel,' recalibrating acquisition settings, and applying computational analyses. Through the analysis of 390,000 individual synaptosomes, we also provide proof-of principle validation by characterizing changes in synaptic diversity in Lewy Body Disease (LBD), Alzheimer's disease and normal brain. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): Current imaging methods to study synapses in humans are capable of analyzing a limited number of synapses, and conventional flow cytometric techniques are typically restricted to fewer than 6 parameters. Our method allows for the simultaneous detection of 34 parameters from tens of thousands of individual synapses. CONCLUSION: We applied Mass Synaptometry to analyze 34 parameters simultaneously on more than 390,000 synaptosomes from 13 human brain samples. This new approach revealed regional and disease-specific changes in synaptic phenotypes, including validation of this method with the expected changes in the molecular composition of striatal dopaminergic synapses in Lewy body disease and Alzheimer's disease. Mass synaptometry enables highly parallel molecular profiling of individual synaptic terminals.

30466001|t|Multi-targeting aurones with monoamine oxidase and amyloid-beta inhibitory activities: Structure-activity relationship and translating multi-potency to neuroprotection.
30466001|a|Previously, a series of aurones bearing amine and carbamate functionalities was synthesized and evaluated for their cholinesterase inhibitory activity and drug-like attributes. In the present study, these aurones were evaluated for their multi-targeting properties in two Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related activities namely, monoamine oxidase (MAO) and amyloid-beta (Abeta) inhibition. Evaluation of the aurones for MAO inhibitory activity disclosed several potent selective inhibitors of MAO-B, particularly those with 6-methoxyl group attached at ring A. Of the different amine moieties attached as side chains, pyrrolidine-bearing aurones were prominent as represented by 2-2, the most potent inhibitor. Evaluation on the Abeta aggregation inhibition identified 4-3 as the best inhibitor with a percentage inhibition comparable to that of a known Abeta inhibitor curcumin. Examination on the neuroprotective ability of the more drug-like aurone 4-3 in two Caenorhabditis elegans neurodegeneration models showed 4-3 to protect the nematodes against both Abeta- and 6-hydroxydopamine-induced toxicities. These new activities further support 4-3 as a promising lead to develop the aurones as potential multipotent agents for neurodegenerative diseases.

30468502|t|Effects of melatonin on expressions of beta-amyloid protein and S100beta in rats with senile dementia.
30468502|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of melatonin (MT) on expressions of beta-amyloid protein (beta-AP) and S100beta in rats with senile dementia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 36 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into Sham group, Model group and MT group, with 12 rats in each group. Senile dementia models were established in each group except Sham group. After modeling, rats in Model group were given tail vein injection with 0.9% sodium chloride once per day. Rats in MT group were given tail vein injection with MT once per day. Materials were collected at 40 d after the intervention. Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) staining was adopted to observe histomorphology of hippocampal area, Western blotting to detect expressions of beta-AP and S100beta protein, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to detect expressions of beta-AP mRNA and S100beta mRNA. RESULTS: Histomorphology in hippocampal area of both Model group and MT group was changed compared with that in Sham group. Histomorphology data showed that the damage in the hippocampal area in MT group was improved compared with that in Model group. Western blotting detection showed that expressions of beta-AP and S100beta in Model group and MT group were significantly increased compared with those in Sham group (p<0.05). Expressions of beta-AP and S100beta protein in MT group were significantly decreased compared with those in Model group (p<0.05). Results of qPCR revealed that expressions of beta-AP mRNA and S100beta mRNA in Model group and MT group were also significantly increased compared with those in Sham group, and there were statistically significant differences (p<0.05). Expressions of beta-AP mRNA and S100beta mRNA in MT group were significantly decreased compared with those in Model group (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: MT can inhibit expressions of beta-AP and S100beta protein in the hippocampal area of model rats with senile dementia, which provides leads for the future treatment of senile dementia.

30468884|t|Membrane-mimetic systems for biophysical studies of the amyloid-beta peptide.
30468884|a|The interplay between the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide and cellular membranes have been proposed as an important mechanism for toxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Membrane environments appear to influence Abeta aggregation and may stabilize intermediate Abeta oligomeric states that are considered to be neurotoxic. One important role for molecular biophysics within the field of Abeta studies is to characterize the structure and dynamics of the Abeta peptide in various states, as well as the kinetics of transfer between these states. Because biological cell membranes are very complex, simplified membrane models are needed to facilitate studies of Abeta and other amyloid proteins in lipid environments. In this review, we examine different membrane-mimetic systems available for molecular studies of Abeta. An introduction to each system is given, and examples of important findings are presented for each system. The benefits and drawbacks of each system are discussed from methodical and biological perspectives.

30470438|t|Relationship between long non-coding RNAs and Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review.
30470438|a|Alzheimer disease (AD), is a typical progressive and destructive neurodegenerative disease. It is the leading cause of senile dementia that is mainly represented as neurocognitive symptoms, including progressive memory impairment, cognitive disorder, personality change and language barrier, etc. The pathogeny and nosogenesis of AD have not been clearly explained. AD is characterized by extracellular senile plaques (SP) formed by beta amyloid (Abeta) deposition and neurofibrillary tangles in neuronal cells formed by hyperphosphorylation of tau, as well as the deficiency of neuronal with gliosis. However, the complete spectrum of regulating factors in molecular level that affect the pathogenesis of AD is unclear. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in numerous neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and AD. It is increasingly recognized that lncRNAs is tightly related to the pathogenesis and prevention and cure of AD. In the review, we highlighted the roles of lncRNAs in AD pathways and discussed increasing interest in targeting and regulating lncRNAs for the therapeutics of AD.

30470799|t|Novel upregulation of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) by microRNA-346 via targeting of APP mRNA 5'-untranslated region: Implications in Alzheimer's disease.
30470799|a|In addition to the devastating symptoms of dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by accumulation of the processing products of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide precursor protein (APP). APP's non-pathogenic functions include regulating intracellular iron (Fe) homeostasis. MicroRNAs are small (~ 20 nucleotides) RNA species that instill specificity to the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). In most cases, RISC inhibits mRNA translation through the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) sequence. By contrast, we report a novel activity of miR-346: specifically, that it targets the APP mRNA 5'-UTR to upregulate APP translation and Abeta production. This upregulation is reduced but not eliminated by knockdown of argonaute 2. The target site for miR-346 overlaps with active sites for an iron-responsive element (IRE) and an interleukin-1 (IL-1) acute box element. IREs interact with iron response protein1 (IRP1), an iron-dependent translational repressor. In primary human brain cultures, miR-346 activity required chelation of Fe. In addition, miR-346 levels are altered in late-Braak stage AD. Thus, miR-346 plays a role in upregulation of APP in the CNS and participates in maintaining APP regulation of Fe, which is disrupted in late stages of AD. Further work will be necessary to integrate other metals, and IL-1 into the Fe-miR-346 activity network. We, thus, propose a "FeAR" (Fe, APP, RNA) nexus in the APP 5'-UTR that includes an overlapping miR-346-binding site and the APP IRE. When a "healthy FeAR" exists, activities of miR-346 and IRP/Fe interact to maintain APP homeostasis. Disruption of an element that targets the FeAR nexus would lead to pathogenic disruption of APP translation and protein production.

30472944|t|Anti-amyloid Therapy of Alzheimer's Disease: Current State and Prospects.
30472944|a|Drug development for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been for a long time focused on agents that were expected to support endogenous beta-amyloid (Abeta) in a monomeric state and destroy soluble Abeta oligomers and insoluble Abeta aggregates. However, this strategy has failed over the last 20 years and was eventually abandoned. In this review, we propose a new approach to the anti-amyloid AD therapy based on the latest achievements in understanding molecular causes of cerebral amyloidosis in AD animal models.

30474860|t|HDL mimetic peptides affect apolipoprotein E metabolism: equal supplement or functional enhancer?: An Editorial for 'High-density lipoprotein mimetic peptide 4F mitigates amyloid-beta-induced inhibition of apolipoprotein E secretion and lipidation in primary astrocytes and microglia' on page 647.
30474860|a|epsilon4 allele of ApoE is the strongest genetic risk factor for late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Supplementation of ApoE proteins or mimetics has been pursued for drug developments against AD. A very low-density lipoprotein (HDL) mimetic peptide 4F was shown to alleviate AD-related deficits in APP transgenic mice, and this editorial highlights a study by Chernick et al. who use both mouse and human neuroglial cells to explore the mechanism underlying beneficial effects of this peptide. The authors demonstrate that 4F peptide significantly increased the secretion and lipidation of ApoE in the absence and presence of Abeta independent of de novo transcription/translation, but requiring ABCA1 and the integrity of the secretory pathway between ER and Golgi. This study reveals a novel mechanism of HDL mimetic peptide as a functional ApoE enhancer and support further development of ApoA-I 4F peptide as effective ApoE modulating agents against AD.

30481490|t|Intracellular metalloprotease activity controls intraneuronal Abeta aggregation and limits secretion of Abeta via exosomes.
30481490|a|Accumulating evidence suggests that the abnormal aggregation of amyloid-beta (Alphabeta) peptide in Alzheimer's disease (AD) begins intraneuronally, within vesicles of the endosomal-lysosomal pathway where Abeta is both generated and degraded. Metalloproteases, including endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE)-1 and -2, reside within these vesicles and normally limit the accumulation of intraneuronally produced Abeta. In this study, we determined whether disruption of Abeta catabolism could trigger Abeta aggregation within neurons and increase the amount of Abeta associated with exosomes, small extracellular vesicles derived from endosomal multivesicular bodies. Using cultured cell lines, primary neurons, and organotypic brain slices from an AD mouse model, we found that pharmacological inhibition of the ECE family of metalloproteases increased intracellular and extracellular Abeta levels and promoted the intracellular formation of Abeta oligomers, a process that did not require internalization of secreted Abeta. In vivo, the accumulation of intraneuronal Abeta aggregates was accompanied by increased levels of both extracellular and exosome-associated Abeta, including oligomeric species. Neuronal exosomes were found to contain both ECE-1 and -2 activities, suggesting that multivesicular bodies are intracellular sites of Abeta degradation by these enzymes. ECE dysfunction could lead to the accumulation of intraneuronal Abeta aggregates and their subsequent release into the extracellular space via exosomes.-Pacheco-Quinto, J., Clausen, D., Perez-Gonzalez, R., Peng, H., Meszaros, A., Eckman, C. B., Levy, E., Eckman, E. A. Intracellular metalloprotease activity controls intraneuronal Abeta aggregation and limits secretion of Abeta via exosomes.

30481507|t|Ameliorative effect of alendronate against intracerebroventricular streptozotocin induced alteration in neurobehavioral, neuroinflammation and biochemical parameters with emphasis on Abeta and BACE-1.
30481507|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent age related neurodegenerative disorder manifested by progressive cognitive decline and neuronal loss in the brain, yet precise etiopathology of majority of sporadic or late-onset AD cases is unknown. AD is associated with various pathological events such as Abeta deposition due to BACE-1 induced cleavage of APP, neuroinflammation, increased cholesterol synthesis, cholinergic deficit and oxidative stress. It was found that bone drug, alendronate (ALN) that cross blood brain barrier inhibits brain cholesterol synthesis and AChE enzyme activity. As cholesterol modifying agents have been supposed to alter AD like pathologies, the current study was designed to investigate the possible neuroprotective and therapeutic potential of ALN against ICV STZ induced experimental sporadic AD (SAD) in mice in a non-cholesterol dependent manner, using donepezil (5 mg/kg) as a reference standard. The preliminary study was done by molecular modelling to identify the binding affinity of ALN with BACE-1 in silico. The prevention of cognitive impairment in mice induced by ICV STZ (3 mg/kg) infused on first and third day, by ALN (1.76 mg/kg p.o.) administered for 15 consecutive days was assessed through Spontaneous Alternation Behavior (SAB) and Morris water maze (MWM) test. Additionally, the protective effect of ALN was also observed by the reversal of altered levels of Abeta1-42, BACE-,1 neuroinflammatory cytokines, AChE activity and oxidative stress markers (except TBARS) in ICV-STZ infused mice. However, the findings of the present study imply the therapeutic potential of ALN against SAD-like complications.

30483944|t|Renewed assessment of the risk of emergent advanced cell therapies to transmit neuroproteinopathies.
30483944|a|The inadvertent transmission of long incubating, untreatable and fatal neurodegenerative prionopathies, notably iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, following transplantation of cadaver-derived corneas, pituitary growth, hormones and dura mater, constitutes a historical precedent which has underpinned the application of precautionary principles to modern day advanced cell therapies. To date these have been reflected by geographic or medical history risk-based deferral of tissue donors. Emergent understanding of other prion-like proteinopathies, their potential independence from prions as a transmissible agent and the variable capability of scalably manufacturable stem cells and derivatives to take up and clear or to propagate prions, substantiate further commitment to qualifying neurodegenerative proteinopathy transmission risks. This is especially so for those involving direct or facilitated access to a recipient's brain or connected visual or nervous system such as for the treatment of stroke, retinal and adult onset neurodegenerative diseases, treatments for which have already commenced. In this review, we assess the prospective global dissemination of advanced cell therapies founded on transplantation or exposure to allogeneic human cells, recap lessons learned from the historical precedents of CJD transmission and review recent advances and current limits in understanding of prion and other neurodegenerative disease prion-like susceptibility and transmission. From these we propose grounds for a reassessment of the risks of emergent advanced cell therapies to transmit neuroproteinopathies and suggestions to ACT developers and regulators for risk mitigation and extension of criteria for deferrals.

30485133|t|Oxymatrine attenuates amyloid beta 42 (Abeta1-42)-induced neurotoxicity in primary neuronal cells and memory impairment in rats.
30485133|a|Amyloid beta 42 (Abeta1-42)-induced oxidative stress causes the death of neuronal cells and is involved in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Oxymatrine (OMT) inhibits oxidative stress. In this study, we investigated the effect of OMT on Abeta1-42-induced neurotoxicity in vivo and in vitro. In the Morris water maze test, OMT significantly decreased escape latency and increased the number of platform crossings. In vitro, OMT markedly increased cell viability and superoxide dismutase activity. Moreover, OMT decreased lactate dehydrogenase leakage, malondialdehyde content, and reactive oxygen species in a dose-dependent manner. OMT upregulated the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax and downregulated the level of caspase-3. Furthermore, OMT inhibited the activation of MAP kinase (ERK 1/2, JNK) and nuclear factor kappaB. In summary, OMT may potentially be used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

30485483|t|Serum Soluble Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 as a Biomarker for Incident Dementia: The Hisayama Study.
30485483|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between serum soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2), a soluble type of an innate immune receptor expressed on the microglia, and the risk of dementia. METHODS: A total of 1,349 Japanese community residents aged 60 and older without dementia were followed prospectively for 10 years (2002-2012). Serum sTREM2 levels were quantified by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and divided into quartiles. Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) of serum sTREM2 levels on the risk of dementia. RESULTS: During the follow-up, 300 subjects developed all-cause dementia; 193 had Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 85 had vascular dementia (VaD). The age- and sex-adjusted incidences of all-cause dementia, AD, and VaD elevated significantly with higher serum sTREM2 levels (all p for trend < 0.012). These associations were not altered after adjustment for confounding factors, including high-sensitive C-reactive protein. Subjects with the highest quartile of serum sTREM2 levels had significantly higher multivariable-adjusted risks of developing all-cause dementia, AD, and VaD than those with the lowest quartile (HR = 2.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.39-2.97, p < 0.001 for all-cause dementia; HR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.02-2.55, p = 0.04 for AD; HR = 2.85, 95% CI = 1.35-6.02, p = 0.006 for VaD). No significant heterogeneity in the association of serum sTREM2 levels with the development of dementia was observed among the other risk factor subgroups (all p for heterogeneity > 0.11). INTERPRETATION: The present findings suggest a significant association between increased serum sTREM2 levels and the risk of developing all-cause dementia, AD, and VaD in the general elderly Japanese population.

30485540|t|Defined astrocytic expression of human amyloid precursor protein in Tg2576 mouse brain.
30485540|a|Transgenic Tg2576 mice expressing human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) with the Swedish mutation are among the most frequently used animal models to study the amyloid pathology related to Alzheimer's disease (AD). The transgene expression in this model is considered to be neuron-specific. Using a novel hAPP-specific antibody in combination with cell type-specific markers for double immunofluorescent labelings and laser scanning microscopy, we here report that-in addition to neurons throughout the brain-astrocytes in the corpus callosum and to a lesser extent in neocortex express hAPP. This astrocytic hAPP expression is already detectable in young Tg2576 mice before the onset of amyloid pathology and still present in aged Tg2576 mice with robust amyloid pathology in neocortex, hippocampus, and corpus callosum. Surprisingly, hAPP immunoreactivity in cortex is restricted to resting astrocytes distant from amyloid plaques but absent from reactive astrocytes in close proximity to amyloid plaques. In contrast, neither microglial cells nor oligodendrocytes of young or aged Tg2576 mice display hAPP labeling. The astrocytic expression of hAPP is substantiated by the analyses of hAPP mRNA and protein expression in primary cultures derived from Tg2576 offspring. We conclude that astrocytes, in particular in corpus callosum, may contribute to amyloid pathology in Tg2576 mice and thus mimic this aspect of AD pathology.

30486385|t|Effect of Varying Concentrations of Docosahexaenoic Acid on Amyloid Beta (1-42) Aggregation: An Atomic Force Microscopy Study.
30486385|a|Healthcare has advanced significantly, bringing with it longer life expectancies and a growing population of elders who suffer from dementia, specifically Alzheimer's disease (AD). The amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide has been implicated in the cause of AD, where the peptides undergo a conformational change and form neurotoxic amyloid oligomers which cause neuronal cell death. While AD has no cure, preventative measures are being designed to either slow down or stop the progression of this neurodegenerative disease. One of these measures involves dietary supplements with polyunsaturated fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). This omega-3 fatty acid is a key component of brain development and has been suggested to reduce the progression of cognitive decline. However, different studies have yielded different results as to whether DHA has positive, negative, or no effects on Abeta fibril formation. We believe that these discrepancies can be explained with varying concentrations of DHA. Here, we test the inhibitory effect of different concentrations of DHA on amyloid fibril formation using atomic force microscopy. Our results show that DHA has a strong inhibitory effect on Abeta1-42 fibril formation at lower concentrations (50% reduction in fibril length) than higher concentrations above its critical micelle concentration (70% increase in fibril length and three times the length of those at lower concentrations). We provide evidence that various concentrations of DHA can play a role in the inhibitory effects of amyloid fibril formation in vitro and help explain the discrepancies observed in previous studies.

30486882|t|SAR228810: an antibody for protofibrillar amyloid beta peptide designed to reduce the risk of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA).
30486882|a|BACKGROUND: Anti-amyloid beta (Abeta) immunotherapy represents a major area of drug development for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, Abeta peptide adopts multiple conformations and the pathological forms to be specifically targeted have not been identified. Abeta immunotherapy-related vasogenic edema has also been severely dose limiting for antibodies with effector functions binding vascular amyloid such as bapineuzumab. These two factors might have contributed to the limited efficacy demonstrated so far in clinical studies. METHODS: To address these limitations, we have engineered SAR228810, a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) with limited Fc effector functions that binds specifically to soluble protofibrillar and fibrillar forms of Abeta peptide and we tested it together with its murine precursor SAR255952 in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: Unlike gantenerumab and BAN2401, SAR228810 and SAR255952 do not bind to Abeta monomers, low molecular weight Abeta oligomers or, in human brain sections, to Abeta diffuse deposits which are not specific of AD pathology. Both antibodies prevent Abeta42 oligomer neurotoxicity in primary neuronal cultures. In vivo, SAR255952, a mouse aglycosylated IgG1, dose-dependently prevented brain amyloid plaque formation and plaque-related inflammation with a minimal active dose of 3 mg/kg/week by the intraperitoneal route. No increase in plasma Abeta levels was observed with SAR255952 treatment, in line with its lack of affinity for monomeric Abeta. The effects of SAR255952 translated into synaptic functional improvement in ex-vivo hippocampal slices. Brain penetration and decoration of cerebral amyloid plaques was documented in live animals and postmortem. SAR255952 (up to 50 mg/kg/week intravenously) did not increase brain microhemorrhages and/or microscopic changes in meningeal and cerebral arteries in old APPSL mice while 3D6, the murine version of bapineuzumab, did. In immunotolerized mice, the clinical candidate SAR228810 demonstrated the same level of efficacy as the murine SAR255952. CONCLUSION: Based on the improved efficacy/safety profile in non-clinical models of SAR228810, a first-in-man single and multiple dose administration clinical study has been initiated in AD patients.

30496824|t|The cAMP/PKA Pathway Inhibits Beta-amyloid Peptide Release from Human Platelets.
30496824|a|The main component of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), the brain of these patients is characterized by deposits in the parenchyma and cerebral blood vessels known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). On the other hand, the platelets are the major source of the Abeta peptide in circulation and once secreted can activate the platelets and endothelial cells producing the secretion of several inflammatory mediators that finally end up unchaining the CAA and later AD. In the present study we demonstrate that cAMP/PKA pathway plays key roles in the regulation of calpain activation and secretion of Abeta in human platelets. We confirmed that inhibition of platelet functionality occurred when platelets were incubated with forskolin (molecule that rapidly increased cAMP levels). In this sense we found that platelets pre-incubated with forskolin (20 muM) present a complete inhibition of calpain activity and this effect is reversed using an inhibitor of protein kinase A. Consequentially, when platelets were inhibited by forskolin a reduction in the processing of the APP with the consequent decrease in the Abeta peptide secretion was observed. Therefore our study provides novel insight in relation to the mechanism of processing and release of the Abeta peptide from human platelets.

30497535|t|Correlations between plasma and PET beta-amyloid levels in individuals with subjective cognitive decline: the Fundacio ACE Healthy Brain Initiative (FACEHBI).
30497535|a|BACKGROUND: Peripheral biomarkers that identify individuals at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) or predicting high amyloid beta (Abeta) brain burden would be highly valuable. To facilitate clinical trials of disease-modifying therapies, plasma concentrations of Abeta species are good candidates for peripheral AD biomarkers, but studies to date have generated conflicting results. METHODS: The Fundacio ACE Healthy Brain Initiative (FACEHBI) study uses a convenience sample of 200 individuals diagnosed with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) at the Fundacio ACE (Barcelona, Spain) who underwent amyloid florbetaben(18F) (FBB) positron emission tomography (PET) brain imaging. Baseline plasma samples from FACEHBI subjects (aged 65.9 +- 7.2 years) were analyzed using the ABtest (Araclon Biotech). This test directly determines the free plasma (FP) and total plasma (TP) levels of Abeta40 and Abeta42 peptides. The association between Abeta40 and Abeta42 plasma levels and FBB-PET global standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) was determined using correlations and linear regression-based methods. The effect of the APOE genotype on plasma Abeta levels and FBB-PET was also assessed. Finally, various models including different combinations of demographics, genetics, and Abeta plasma levels were constructed using logistic regression and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) analyses to evaluate their ability for discriminating which subjects presented brain amyloidosis. RESULTS: FBB-PET global SUVR correlated weakly but significantly with Abeta42/40 plasma ratios. For TP42/40, this observation persisted after controlling for age and APOE epsilon4 allele carrier status (R2 = 0.193, p = 1.01E-09). The ROC curve demonstrated that plasma Abeta measurements are not superior to APOE and age in combination in predicting brain amyloidosis. It is noteworthy that using a simple preselection tool (the TP42/40 ratio with an empirical cut-off value of 0.08) optimizes the sensitivity and reduces the number of individuals subjected to Abeta FBB-PET scanners to 52.8%. No significant dependency was observed between APOE genotype and plasma Abeta measurements (p value for interaction = 0.105). CONCLUSION: Brain and plasma Abeta levels are partially correlated in individuals diagnosed with SCD. Abeta plasma measurements, particularly the TP42/40 ratio, could generate a new recruitment strategy independent of the APOE genotype that would improve identification of SCD subjects with brain amyloidosis and reduce the rate of screening failures in preclinical AD studies. Independent replication of these findings is warranted.

30498985|t|Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide Decreases beta-Amyloid Accumulation and Prevents Brain Atrophy in the 5xFAD Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.
30498985|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by extracellular deposits of fibrillary beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques in the brain that initiate an inflammatory process resulting in neurodegeneration. The neuronal loss associated with AD results in gross atrophy of affected regions causing a progressive loss of cognitive ability and memory function, ultimately leading to dementia. Growing evidence suggests that vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) could be beneficial for various neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. The study investigated the effects of VIP on 5xFAD, a transgenic mouse model of AD. Toward this aim, we used 20 5xFAD mice in two groups (n = 10 each), VIP-treated (25 ng/kg i.p. injection, three times per week) and saline-treated (the drug's vehicle) following the same administration regimen. Treatment started at 1 month of age and ended 2 months later. After 2 months of treatment, the mice were euthanized, their brains dissected out, and immunohistochemically stained for Abeta40 and Abeta42 on serial sections. Then, plaque analysis and stereological morphometric analysis were performed in different brain regions. Chronic VIP administration in 5xFAD mice significantly decreased the levels of Abeta40 and Abeta42 plaques in the subiculum compared to the saline treated 5xFAD mice. VIP treatment also significantly decreased Abeta40 and Abeta42 plaques in cortical areas and significantly increased the hippocampus/cerebrum and corpus callosum/cerebrum ratio but not the cerebral cortex/cerebrum ratio. In summary, we found that chronic administration of VIP significantly decreased Abeta plaques and preserved against atrophy for related brain regions in 5xFAD AD mice.

30504054|t|A novel synthesis of selenium nanoparticles encapsulated PLGA nanospheres with curcumin molecules for the inhibition of amyloid beta aggregation in Alzheimer's disease.
30504054|a|The main factors of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are the cerebral accumulation and the formation of extracellular amyloid plaques. The Abeta peptides are highly able to accumulative and produce fibrils that are placed to form these plaques in the AD. The biological action and drug delivery properties of curcumin (Cur) nanoformulation in the Alzheimer's disease therapeutics can be developed by the altering surface of the Poly-lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) polymer and encapsulation of selenium nanoparticles (Se NPs). The morphological structure, size distributions of nanospheres, chemical interactions between the polymer and nanoformulations of synthesized curcumin and Se NPs loaded PLGA nanospheres have been studied by using the techniques of analytical instruments. The microscopic and nano observation results of synthesized Cur loaded nanospheres are exhibited that the mono-dispersed distributions of particles with spherical shaped structure. The present drug delivery system of Cur loaded Se-PLGA nanospheres could be decreases the amyloid-beta load in the brains samples of AD mice, and greatly cured the memory deficiency of the model mice. The specific binding of Cur loaded Se-PLGA nanospheres with Abeta plaques were visualized by fluorescence microscopic technique. Se-PLGA targeting delivery system to amyloid plaques might be providing the enhanced therapeutic efficacy in AD lesions, which was studied by using transgenic mice (5XFAD). In conclusion, Cur loaded Se-PLGA nanoformulation has been demonstrated that valued delivery system for the targeted delivery and effective way to treat AD.

30504224|t|Structural progression of amyloid-beta Arctic mutant aggregation in cells revealed by multiparametric imaging.
30504224|a|The 42-amino-acid beta-amyloid (Abeta42) is a critical causative agent in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. The hereditary Arctic mutation of Abeta42 (E22G) leads to increased intracellular accumulation of beta-amyloid in early-onset Alzheimer's disease. However, it remains largely unknown how the Arctic mutant variant leads to aggressive protein aggregation and increased intracellular toxicity. Here, we constructed stable cell lines expressing fluorescent-tagged wildtype (WT) and E22G Abeta42 to study the aggregation kinetics of the Arctic Abeta42 mutant peptide and its heterogeneous structural forms. Arctic-mutant peptides assemble and form fibrils at a much faster rate than WT peptides. We identified five categories of intracellular aggregate-oligomers, single fibrils, fibril bundles, clusters, and aggresomes-that underline the heterogeneity of these Abeta42 aggregates and represent the progression of Abeta42 aggregation within the cell. Fluorescence-lifetime imaging (FLIM) and 3D structural illumination microscopy (SIM) showed that all aggregate species displayed highly compact structures with strong affinity between individual fibrils. We also found that aggregates formed by Arctic mutant Abeta42 were more resistant to intracellular degradation than their WT counterparts. Our findings uncover the structural basis of the progression of Arctic mutant Abeta42 aggregation in the cell.

30509980|t|Probing the mechanism of inhibition of amyloid-beta(1-42)-induced neurotoxicity by the chaperonin GroEL.
30509980|a|The human chaperonin Hsp60 is thought to play a role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease by mitigating against intracellular beta-amyloid stress. Here, we show that the bacterial homolog GroEL (51% sequence identity) reduces the neurotoxic effects of amyloid-beta(1-42) (Abeta42) on human neural stem cell-derived neuronal cultures. To understand the mechanism of GroEL-mediated abrogation of neurotoxicity, we studied the interaction of Abeta42 with GroEL using a variety of biophysical techniques. Abeta42 binds to GroEL as a monomer with a lifetime of ~1 ms, as determined from global analysis of multiple relaxation-based NMR experiments. Dynamic light scattering demonstrates that GroEL dissolves small amounts of high-molecular-weight polydisperse aggregates present in fresh soluble Abeta42 preparations. The residue-specific transverse relaxation rate profile for GroEL-bound Abeta42 reveals the presence of three anchor-binding regions (residues 16-21, 31-34, and 40-41) located within the hydrophobic GroEL-consensus binding sequences. Single-molecule FRET analysis of Abeta42 binding to GroEL results in no significant change in the FRET efficiency of a doubly labeled Abeta42 construct, indicating that Abeta42 samples a random coil ensemble when bound to GroEL. Finally, GroEL substantially slows down the disappearance of NMR visible Abeta42 species and the appearance of Abeta42 protofibrils and fibrils as monitored by electron and atomic force microscopies. The latter observations correlate with the effect of GroEL on the time course of Abeta42-induced neurotoxicity. These data provide a physical basis for understanding how Hsp60 may serve to slow down the progression of Alzheimer's disease.

30510257|t|Identification of evolutionarily conserved gene networks mediating neurodegenerative dementia.
30510257|a|Identifying the mechanisms through which genetic risk causes dementia is an imperative for new therapeutic development. Here, we apply a multistage, systems biology approach to elucidate the disease mechanisms in frontotemporal dementia. We identify two gene coexpression modules that are preserved in mice harboring mutations in MAPT, GRN and other dementia mutations on diverse genetic backgrounds. We bridge the species divide via integration with proteomic and transcriptomic data from the human brain to identify evolutionarily conserved, disease-relevant networks. We find that overexpression of miR-203, a hub of a putative regulatory microRNA (miRNA) module, recapitulates mRNA coexpression patterns associated with disease state and induces neuronal cell death, establishing this miRNA as a regulator of neurodegeneration. Using a database of drug-mediated gene expression changes, we identify small molecules that can normalize the disease-associated modules and validate this experimentally. Our results highlight the utility of an integrative, cross-species network approach to drug discovery.

30511086|t|Neurons selectively targeted in frontotemporal dementia reveal early stage TDP-43 pathobiology.
30511086|a|TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) aggregation is the most common pathological hallmark in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and characterizes nearly all patients with motor neuron disease (MND). The earliest stages of TDP-43 pathobiology are not well-characterized, and whether neurodegeneration results from TDP-43 loss-of-function or aggregation remains unclear. In the behavioral variant of FTD (bvFTD), patients undergo selective dropout of von Economo neurons (VENs) and fork cells within the frontoinsular (FI) and anterior cingulate cortices. Here, we examined TDP-43 pathobiology within these vulnerable neurons in the FI across a clinical spectrum including 17 patients with sporadic bvFTD, MND, or both. In an exploratory analysis based on our initial observations, we further assessed ten patients with C9orf72-associated bvFTD/MND. VENs and fork cells showed early, disproportionate TDP-43 aggregation that correlated with anatomical and clinical severity, including loss of emotional empathy. The presence of a TDP-43 inclusion was associated with striking nuclear and somatodendritic atrophy. An intriguing minority of neurons lacked detectable nuclear TDP-43 despite the apparent absence of a cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusion. These cells showed neuronal atrophy comparable to inclusion-bearing neurons, suggesting that the loss of nuclear TDP-43 function promotes neurodegeneration, even when TDP-43 aggregation is inconspicuous or absent.

30514971|t|A near atomic-scale view at the composition of amyloid-beta fibrils by atom probe tomography.
30514971|a|Amyloid-beta (Ab) proteins play an important role in a number of neurodegenerative diseases. Ab is found in senile plaques in brains of Alzeimer's disease patients. The 42 residues of the monomer form dimers which stack to fibrils gaining several micrometers in length. Using Ab fibrils with 13C and 15N marker substitution, we developed an innovative approach to obtain insights to structural and chemical information of the protein. We deposited the modified protein fibrils to pre-sharped aluminium needles with >100-nm apex diameters and, using the position-sensitive mass-to-charge spectrometry technique of atom probe tomography, we acquired the chemically-resolved three dimensional information for every detected ion evaporated in small fragments from the protein. We also discuss the influence of experimental parameters such as pulse energy and pulse frequency of the used Laser beam which lead to differences in the size of the gained fragments, developing the capability of localising metal atom within Ab plaques.

30515701|t|Amyloid Beta 1-42 Alters the Expression of miRNAs in Cortical Neurons.
30515701|a|Recently, Abeta1-42 was demonstrated to have the potential to translocate into the nucleus and to be involved in the transcriptional regulation of certain neurodegeneration-related genes. This data raises the question of whether Abeta-induced neurodegeneration might include the expression of miRNAs. Thus, our aim in this study was to investigate the effects of Abeta1-42 on certain miRNAs which are related with vitamin D metabolism, neuronal differentiation, development, and memory. This question was investigated in primary cortical neurons that were treated with 10 muM Abeta and/or 10-8 M 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 at different time points by expression analysis of let-7a-5p, miR-26b-5p, miR-27b-3p, miR-31a-5p, miR-125b-5p, and miR-192-5p with qRT-PCR. Our data indicate that amyloid pathology has effects on the expression of miRNAs. Furthermore, some of these miRNAs simultaneously regulate the proteins or the enzymes involved in neuronal metabolism. The experimental setup that we used and the data we acquired supply valuable information about the miRNAs that play a part in the Abeta pathology and suggested Abeta as a counterpart of vitamin D at the crossroads of neuronal differentiation, development, and memory.

30518596|t|Alzheimer's Disease Risk Factor Pyk2 Mediates Amyloid-beta-Induced Synaptic Dysfunction and Loss.
30518596|a|Dozens of genes have been implicated in late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, but none has a defined mechanism of action in neurons. Here, we show that the risk factor Pyk2 (PTK2B) localizes specifically to neurons in adult brain. Absence of Pyk2 has no major effect on synapse formation or the basal parameters of synaptic transmission in the hippocampal Schaffer collateral pathway. However, the induction of synaptic LTD is suppressed in Pyk2-null slices. In contrast, deletion of Pyk2 expression does not alter LTP under control conditions. Of relevance for AD pathophysiology, Pyk2-/- slices are protected from amyloid-beta-oligomer (Abetao)-induced suppression of LTP in hippocampal slices. Acutely, a Pyk2 kinase inhibitor also prevents Abetao-induced suppression of LTP in WT slices. Female and male transgenic AD model mice expressing APPswe/PSEN1DeltaE9 require Pyk2 for age-dependent loss of synaptic markers and for impairment of learning and memory. However, absence of Pyk2 does not alter Abeta accumulation or gliosis. Therefore, the Pyk2 risk gene is directly implicated in a neuronal Abetao signaling pathway impairing synaptic anatomy and function.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Genetic variation at the Pyk2 (PTK2B) locus is a risk for late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the pathophysiological role of Pyk2 is not clear. Here, we studied Pyk2 neuronal function in mice lacking expression with and without transgenes generating amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaque pathology. Pyk2 is not required for basal synaptic transmission or LTP, but participates in LTD. Hippocampal slices lacking Pyk2 are protected from AD-related Abeta oligomer suppression of synaptic plasticity. In transgenic AD model mice, deletion of Pyk2 rescues synaptic loss and learning/memory deficits. Therefore, Pyk2 plays a central role in AD-related synaptic dysfunction mediating Abeta-triggered dysfunction.

30528194|t|Activity-Induced Amyloid-beta Oligomers Drive Compensatory Synaptic Rearrangements in Brain Circuits Controlling Memory of Presymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease Mice.
30528194|a|BACKGROUND: A consistent proportion of individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease show intact cognition regardless of the extensive accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide in their brain. Several pieces of evidence indicate that overactivation of brain regions negative for Abeta can compensate for the underactivation of Abeta-positive ones to preserve cognition, but the underlying synaptic changes are still unexplored. METHODS: Using Golgi staining, we investigate how dendritic spines rearrange following contextual fear conditioning (CFC) in the hippocampus and amygdala of presymptomatic Tg2576 mice, a genetic model for Abeta accumulation. A molecular biology approach combined with intrahippocampal injection of a gamma-secretase inhibitor evaluates the impact of Abeta fluctuations on spine rearrangements. RESULTS: Encoding of CFC increases Abeta oligomerization in the hippocampus but not in the amygdala of Tg2576 mice. The presence of Abeta oligomers predicts vulnerability to network dysfunctions, as low c-Fos activation and spine maturation are detected in the hippocampus of Tg2576 mice upon recall of CFC memory. Rather, enhanced c-Fos activation and new spines are evident in the amygdala of Tg2576 mice compared with wild-type control mice. Preventing Abeta increase in the hippocampus of Tg2576 mice restores CFC-associated spine changes to wild-type levels in both the hippocampus and amygdala. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides the first evidence of neural compensation consisting of enhanced synaptic activity in brain regions spared by Abeta load. Furthermore, it unravels an activity-mediated feedback loop through which neuronal activation during CFC encoding favors Abeta oligomerization in the hippocampus and prevents synaptic rearrangements in this region.

30529844|t|Phenylpropanoids and lignans from Prunus tomentosa seeds as efficient beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregation inhibitors.
30529844|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the progressive accumulation of extracellular beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregates. Recently, lignans and phenylpropanoids are attracting increasing attention to discovery useful agents of inhibition on Abeta aggregation. In the present study, to develop potential agents for slowing the progression of AD, Prunus tomentosa seeds were selected as a raw material for bioactive compounds, which led to the separation of two pairs of new enantiomeric lignans and phenylpropanoids using chiral HPLC. The planar structures of these compounds were elucidated by spectroscopic data analyses. And their absolute configurations were determined by comparing of experimental and calculated electronic circular dichroism (ECD). The biosynthesis pathway was also discussed. Additionally, the inhibitory activity on Abeta aggregation of all optical pure compounds was tested by thioflavin T (ThT) assay. The isolates (1a, 1b, 2a and 2b) showed more potent inhibitory activity than positive control curcumin with inhibitory rate of 73.89 +- 3.41% 78.69 +- 1.50%, 63.25 +- 2.68%, and 67.13 +- 0.90% at 20 muM, respectively. More importantly, the inhibition profiles were explained by molecular dynamics and docking simulation studies.

30532598|t|Thirty-year trends in dementia: a nationwide population study of Swedish inpatient records.
30532598|a|Background: The continuous growth of the current dementia epidemic is contingent on the stability of age- and sex-specific trends over time. However, recent evidence suggests declining or stable trends. The aim of this study was to evaluate the real-world changes in the burden of dementia in older adults in Sweden from 1987 to 2016 by estimating age- and sex-specific incidence of dementia diagnosis in hospital inpatient records (dementia incidence). Differences in trends by sex, age, and educational levels were also examined. Methods: The entire Swedish population aged 65 years and older was followed up from 1987 to 2016. Age-, sex-, and education-stratified dementia incidence rates for every follow-up year were estimated using the National Patient Register. Hazard ratio of receiving a dementia diagnosis in the inpatient records per 1 calendar year increase was estimated with discrete time logistic models with a complementary log-log link. Results: After increase, especially in those >85 years of age, dementia incidence started to decrease in the last 5 years of the study period. After 2011, 1 calendar year increase was associated with lower hazard ratio of receiving a hospital diagnosis of dementia. The decrease had the highest magnitude in 70-74-year-olds (-5.5%), followed by 75-79-year-olds (-4.5%) and 80-84-year-olds (-4.0%). The decrease was present in both sexes and at all educational levels up to 90 years of age. Age was associated with the level of dementia incidence, and the trends differed by age group. Educational gradient was observed. University-educated older adults had the lowest rates of dementia. However, the trend over time did not substantially differ by sex or educational level. Conclusion: Our results provide more evidence that dementia incidence may be declining. They also suggest that at least in hospitals, the number of new patients with dementia may decrease in the future.

30532948|t|Enhanced Photoresponsive Graphene Oxide-Modified g-C3N4 for Disassembly of Amyloid beta Fibrils.
30532948|a|Protein misfolding and abnormal self-assembly lead to the aggregates of oligomers, fibrils, or senior amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques, which are associated with the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases. Progressive cerebral accumulation of Abeta protein was widely proposed to explain the cause of Alzheimer's disease, for which one promising direction of the preclinical study is to convert the preformed beta-sheet structure of Abeta aggregates into innocent structures. However, the conversion is even harder than the modulation of the amyloidosis process. Herein, a graphene oxide/carbon nitride composite was developed as a good photocatalyst for irreversibly disassembling the Abeta aggregates of Abeta(33-42) under UV. Quartz crystal microbalance, circular dichroism spectrum, atomic force microscopy, fluorescent spectra, and mechanical property analysis were performed to analyze this photodegradation process from different aspects for fully understanding the mechanism, which may provide an important enlightenment for the relevant research in this field and neurodegenerative disease study.

30536948|t|Tau PET Imaging for Staging of Alzheimer's Disease in Down Syndrome.
30536948|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and early-onset dementia develop almost universally in Down syndrome (DS). AD is defined neuropathologically by the presence of extracellular plaques of aggregated amyloid beta protein and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of aggregated hyperphosphorylated tau protein. The development of radiolabeled positron emission tomography (PET) ligands for amyloid plaques and tau tangles enables the longitudinal assessment of the spatial pattern of their accumulation in relation to symptomatology. Recent work indicates that amyloid pathology develops 15-20 years before neurodegeneration and symptom onset in the sporadic and autosomal dominant forms of AD, while tau pathology correlates more closely with symptomatic stages evidenced by cognitive decline and dementia. Recent work on AD biomarkers in DS illustrates similarities between DS and sporadic AD. It may soon be possible to apply recently developed staging classifications to DS to obtain a more nuanced understanding of the development AD in DS and to provide more accurate diagnosis and prognosis in the clinic.

30537643|t|Molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations and QSAR studies on some of 2-arylethenylquinoline derivatives for inhibition of Alzheimer's amyloid-beta aggregation: Insight into mechanism of interactions and parameters for design of new inhibitors.
30537643|a|Alzheimer's disease is characterized using amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregation. The present work was carried out to extend and design a novel quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model on inhibition efficiency of some of new 2-arylethenylquinoline derivatives against the Abeta1-42 peptide aggregation. The QSAR study, molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to explore the influence of the structural features and investigate the molecular mechanism of ligands interactions with the Abeta1-42 peptide. Using molecular docking was understood that electron donating groups with small size help to create interactions between the ligands and peptide residues to stabilize the conformation of ligands at the binding pocket. QSAR model was developed using the most stable conformations and parameters that obtained from the molecular docking. It is shown that, a combination of docking parameters and structural descriptors of inhibitor compounds can describe the inhibition efficiency on Abeta1-42 peptide. The model exhibited statistically significant results so that the coefficient of determination R2train, Q2LOO, R2ext and GH (goodness of hit) are 0.912, 0.915, 0.836 and 0.804, respectively. The stability and binding modes of the compounds 1 and 13 with the most inhibition efficiency and compounds 12 and 36 with the lowest inhibition efficiency were determined by molecular dynamics simulations in GROMACS package. It is showed that interactions of compounds 1 and 13 are stable after 25ns of trajectories. Based on obtained results, 10 new drug compounds have been designed that provide better inhibition efficiency with the Abeta1-42 peptide than the reference compounds.

30541279|t|Ginkgolide A Prevents the Amyloid-beta-Induced Depolarization of Cortical Neurons.
30541279|a|Utilizing the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist as a strategy, memantine is the only agent available for clinically treating mild to severe Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our aim was to develop novel similar herb-based drugs. Using a screening platform, ginkgolide A (GA), a pure compound extracted from Ginkgo biloba, was found to attenuate amyloid beta (Abeta)-induced abnormal depolarization in mouse primary cortical neurons. Using receptor agonists, it was determined that GA inhibits both NMDA receptors and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors. Furthermore, the Abeta-induced increase in c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation in neurons was prevented by GA. Body weight, glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, liver histology, and kidney histology were similar when the wild-type/AD animal model mice with and without GA treatment were compared. This pure compound improves the memory of wild-type mice. Our findings indicate that GA has great potential clinically for the treatment of AD because it might target NMDA receptors just like memantine.

30545942|t|The trans-Golgi network is a major site for alpha-secretase processing of amyloid precursor protein in primary neurons.
30545942|a|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is processed along the amyloidogenic pathway by the beta-secretase, BACE1, generating beta-amyloid (Abeta), or along the nonamyloidogenic pathway by alpha-secretase, precluding Abeta production. The plasma membrane is considered the major site for alpha-secretase-mediated APP cleavage, but other cellular locations have not been rigorously investigated. Here, we report that APP is processed by endogenous alpha-secretase at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) of both transfected HeLa cells and mouse primary neurons. We have previously shown the adaptor protein complex, AP-4, and small G protein ADP-ribosylation factor-like GTPase 5b (Arl5b) are required for efficient post-Golgi transport of APP to endosomes. We found here that AP-4 or Arl5b depletion results in Golgi accumulation of APP and increased secretion of the soluble alpha-secretase cleavage product sAPPalpha. Moreover, inhibition of gamma-secretase following APP accumulation in the TGN increases the levels of the membrane-bound C-terminal fragments of APP from both alpha-secretase cleavage (alpha-CTF, named C83 according to its band size) and BACE1 cleavage (beta-CTF/C99). The level of C83 was ~4 times higher than that of C99, indicating that alpha-secretase processing is the major pathway and that BACE1 processing is the minor pathway in the TGN. AP-4 silencing in mouse primary neurons also resulted in the accumulation of endogenous APP in the TGN and enhanced alpha-secretase processing. These findings identify the TGN as a major site for alpha-secretase processing in HeLa cells and primary neurons and indicate that both APP processing pathways can occur within the TGN compartment along the secretory pathway.

30546139|t|Transmission of amyloid-beta protein pathology from cadaveric pituitary growth hormone.
30546139|a|We previously reported1 the presence of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) deposits in individuals with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) who had been treated during childhood with human cadaveric pituitary-derived growth hormone (c-hGH) contaminated with prions. The marked deposition of parenchymal and vascular Abeta in these relatively young individuals with treatment-induced (iatrogenic) CJD (iCJD), in contrast to other prion-disease patients and population controls, allied with the ability of Alzheimer's disease brain homogenates to seed Abeta deposition in laboratory animals, led us to argue that the implicated c-hGH batches might have been contaminated with Abeta seeds as well as with prions. However, this was necessarily an association, and not an experimental, study in humans and causality could not be concluded. Given the public health importance of our hypothesis, we proceeded to identify and biochemically analyse archived vials of c-hGH. Here we show that certain c-hGH batches to which patients with iCJD and Abeta pathology were exposed have substantial levels of Abeta40, Abeta42 and tau proteins, and that this material can seed the formation of Abeta plaques and cerebral Abeta-amyloid angiopathy in intracerebrally inoculated mice expressing a mutant, humanized amyloid precursor protein. These results confirm the presence of Abeta seeds in archived c-hGH vials and are consistent with the hypothesized iatrogenic human transmission of Abeta pathology. This experimental confirmation has implications for both the prevention and the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and should prompt a review of the risk of iatrogenic transmission of Abeta seeds by medical and surgical procedures long recognized to pose a risk of accidental prion transmission2,3.

30547227|t|Novel tau fragments in cerebrospinal fluid: relation to tangle pathology and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.
30547227|a|Tau is an axonal microtubule-binding protein. Tau pathology in brain and increased tau concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Most of tau in CSF is present as fragments. We immunoprecipitated tau from CSF and identified several endogenous peptides ending at amino acid (aa) 123 or 224 using high-resolution mass spectrometry. We raised neo-epitope-specific antibodies against tau fragments specifically ending at aa 123 and 224, respectively. With these antibodies, we performed immunohistochemistry on brain tissue and designed immunoassays measuring N-123, N-224, and x-224 tau. Immunoassays were applied to soluble brain fractions from pathologically confirmed subjects (81 AD patients, 33 controls), CSF from three cross-sectional and two longitudinal cohorts (a total of 133 AD, 38 MCI, 20 MCI-AD, 31 PSP, 15 CBS patients, and 91 controls), and neuronally- and peripherally-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs and PDEVs, respectively) in serum from four AD patients and four controls. Anti-tau 224 antibody stained neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads, while anti-tau 123 only showed weak cytoplasmic staining in AD. N-224 tau was lower in the AD soluble brain fraction compared to controls, while N-123 tau showed similar levels. N-224 tau was higher in AD compared to controls in all CSF cohorts (p < 0.001), but not N-123 tau. Decrease in cognitive performance and conversion from MCI to AD were associated with increased baseline CSF levels of N-224 tau (p < 0.0001). N-224 tau concentrations in PSP and CBS were significantly lower than in AD (p < 0.0001) and did not correlate to t-tau and p-tau. In a longitudinal cohort, CSF N-224 tau levels were stable over 6 months, with no significant effect of treatment with AChE inhibitors. N-224 tau was present in NDEVs, while N-123 tau showed comparable concentrations in both vesicle types. We suggest that N-123 tau is produced both in CNS and PNS and represents a general marker of tau metabolism, while N-224 tau is neuron-specific, present in the tangles, secreted in CSF, and upregulated in AD, suggesting a link between tau cleavage and propagation, tangle pathology, and cognitive decline.

30548663|t|The effect of early growth response 1 on levels of Amyloid-beta 40 peptide in U87MG cells.
30548663|a|A recent study has shown that early growth response 1 (EGR1) plays a critical role in the beta-amyloid cascade and tau hypotheses. In addition, evidence has suggested that EGR1 can regulate levels of amyloid-beta peptides, key molecules in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, whether EGR1 is a deleterious or protective factor in the AD is still controversial. In this present study, we constructed an overexpression plasmid, CMV-EGFP-EGR1-Kanamycin, and transfected it into U87MG cells to investigate the effects of EGR1 expression on amyloid-beta (1-40) peptide (Abeta40) levels. U87MG cells transfected by CMV-EGFP-EGR1-Kanamycin and CMV-EGFP-Kanamycin were assigned, respectively, to experimental and control groups. Fluorescence microscopy was used to observe transfection efficiencies of the plasmids after 6 hours. EGR1 messenger RNA levels were measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Abeta40 secretion was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Expression of the amyloid precursor protein, beta-secretase enzyme, and presenilin 1 proteins were analyzed by Western blot analysis. The results showed that EGR1 overexpression increased Abeta40 secretion in vitro, possibly through increasing BACE1 expression. Based on these results, EGR1 might be a promising therapeutic target for the AD.

30551564|t|Jowiseungchungtang Inhibits Amyloid-beta Aggregation and Amyloid-beta-Mediated Pathology in 5XFAD Mice.
30551564|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease, which is accompanied by memory loss and cognitive dysfunction. Although a number of trials to treat AD are in progress, there are no drugs available that inhibit the progression of AD. As the aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides in the brain is considered to be the major pathology of AD, inhibition of Abeta aggregation could be an effective strategy for AD treatment. Jowiseungchungtang (JWS) is a traditional oriental herbal formulation that has been shown to improve cognitive function in patients or animal models with dementia. However, there are no reports examining the effects of JWS on Abeta aggregation. Thus, we investigated whether JWS could protect against both Abeta aggregates and Abeta-mediated pathology such as neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and impaired adult neurogenesis in 5 five familial Alzheimer's disease mutations (5XFAD) mice, an animal model for AD. In an in vitro thioflavin T assay, JWS showed a remarkable anti-Abeta aggregation effect. Histochemical analysis indicated that JWS had inhibitory effects on Abeta aggregation, Abeta-induced pathologies, and improved adult hippocampal neurogenesis in vivo. Taken together, these results suggest the therapeutic possibility of JWS for AD targeting Abeta aggregation, Abeta-mediated neurodegeneration, and impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis.

30553154|t|Influence of hypertension on brain amyloid deposition and Alzheimer's disease signature neurodegeneration.
30553154|a|This study aimed to investigate the relationship of hypertension with beta-amyloid (Abeta) and neurodegeneration biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the modulating effect of apolipoprotein E-epsilon4 (APOE4). In total, 259 cognitively normal (CN) and 79 AD dementia older adults received clinical assessments including the evaluation for the presence of hypertension, [11C]-Pittsburgh-compound-B-positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and APOE genotyping. We used a clinical stage-specific approach, separately focusing on CN and AD dementia stages. For the CN group, individuals with hypertension showed reduced AD signature cortical thickness compared with those without hypertension. Subsequent subgroup analyses showed that hypertension was associated with reduced AD signature cortical thickness only in APOE4 noncarriers, whereas hypertension was associated with elevated Abeta deposition in APOE4 carriers. Meanwhile, regardless of APOE4 status, AD dementia patients with hypertension had significantly lower Abeta deposition than those without hypertension. In conclusion, the findings suggest that hypertension contributes to AD primarily through the reduction of brain reserve. In case of APOE4 carriers, however, hypertension seems to additionally facilitate AD process through amyloid-dependent pathway.

30553911|t|Novel antibody against oligomeric amyloid-beta: Insight into factors for effectively reducing the aggregation and cytotoxicity of amyloid-beta aggregates.
30553911|a|Amyloid-beta 42 (Abeta42) aggregates represent a prominent histopathological feature in Alzheimer's disease (AD); thus, immunotherapy against oligomeric Abeta42 aggregates is considered to be a potentially safe and specific therapeutic strategy. In this study, we identified an anti-oligomeric Abeta42 aggregate single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody, HT6, that is capable of efficiently binding to medium-sized Abeta42 aggregates (mainly 18-45 kDa) in vitro with an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 3.0 x 10-6 M, whether they were derived from Abeta42 monomer, larger Abeta42 oligomers, or even fibrils. This ability allowed scFv HT6 to induce the gradual disassembly of large Abeta42 aggregates into small Abeta42 oligomers while simultaneously effectively inhibiting the further development of Abeta42 aggregates. Moreover, the scFv HT6-targeted conformational region on Abeta42 aggregates was found to be more local and relatively close to the N-terminus of Abeta42; thus, scFv HT6 significantly delayed or even prevented the aggregation of Abeta42 protofibrils, while significantly reducing the cytotoxicity of Abeta42 oligomers. Overall, this study demonstrate that even though the decrease in the cytotoxicity of Abeta42 aggregates might be closely related to the reduction in Abeta42 aggregates and vice versa, the reduction in Abeta42 aggregates might not necessarily be accompanied by or followed by the reduction or even elimination of the cytotoxicity of Abeta42 aggregates. This insight enriches the diversity of anti-oligomeric Abeta42 antibodies, further providing a new understanding into the relationship between their binding pattern to Abeta42 aggregates and the efficacy against their formation, offering a therapeutic strategy to delay the progression of AD.

30556393|t|Strategies Employing Transition Metal Complexes To Modulate Amyloid-beta Aggregation.
30556393|a|Aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides is implicated in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia. Thus, numerous efforts to identify chemical tactics to control the aggregation pathways of Abeta peptides have been made. Among them, transition metal complexes as a class of chemical modulators against Abeta aggregation have been designed and utilized. Transition metal complexes are able to carry out a variety of chemistry with Abeta peptides (e.g., coordination chemistry and oxidative and proteolytic reactions for peptide modifications) based on their tunable characteristics, including the oxidation state of and coordination geometry around the metal center. This Viewpoint illustrates three strategies employing transition metal complexes toward modulation of Abeta aggregation pathways (i.e., oxidation and hydrolysis of Abeta as well as coordination to Abeta), along with some examples of such transition metal complexes. In addition, proposed mechanisms for three reactivities of transition metal complexes with Abeta peptides are discussed. Our greater understanding of how transition metal complexes have been engineered and used for alteration of Abeta aggregation could provide insight into the new discovery of chemical reagents against Abeta peptides found in AD.

30557658|t|Cerebrospinal fluid ferritin levels predict brain hypometabolism in people with underlying beta-amyloid pathology.
30557658|a|beta-Amyloid pathology is elevated in ~30% of cognitively normal people over 65, and is associated with accelerated neurodegeneration in the pre-clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease. Recent findings reveal that brain iron might also act to propel neurodegeneration in people with underlying amyloid pathology. Here, repeated PET scans of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) were used as a biomarker for brain hypometabolism and a downstream biomarker of neurodegeneration to investigate whether levels of ferritin in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; a reporter of brain iron load) are associated with prodromal disease progression of people with high beta-amyloid pathology determined by established cut-off values in CSF t-tau/Abeta42 ratio. Nineteen cognitively normal participants with low t-tau/Abeta42, and 71 participants with high t-tau/Abeta42 who were cognitively normal or had mild cognitive impairment were included as participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. These subjects had repeated FDG-PET scans at 6-month intervals for 2 years, and yearly intervals for up to a further 3 years. In mixed-effects linear models of FDG signal, baseline CSF ferritin was associated with an accelerated decline in FDG PET in high t-tau/Abeta42 participants (beta[SE] = -0.066 [0.017]; P = .0002), but not in people with low t-tau/Abeta42 (-0.029 [0.049]; P = .554). These data implicate iron as a contributing factor to neurodegeneration associated with beta-amyloid pathology, and highlight CSF ferritin as a complementary prognostic biomarker to the t-tau/Abeta42 ratio that predicts near-term risk for disease progression.

30559469|t|A tau homeostasis signature is linked with the cellular and regional vulnerability of excitatory neurons to tau pathology.
30559469|a|Excitatory neurons are preferentially impaired in early Alzheimer's disease but the pathways contributing to their relative vulnerability remain largely unknown. Here we report that pathological tau accumulation takes place predominantly in excitatory neurons compared to inhibitory neurons, not only in the entorhinal cortex, a brain region affected in early Alzheimer's disease, but also in areas affected later by the disease. By analyzing RNA transcripts from single-nucleus RNA datasets, we identified a specific tau homeostasis signature of genes differentially expressed in excitatory compared to inhibitory neurons. One of the genes, BCL2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3), a facilitator of autophagy, was identified as a hub, or master regulator, gene. We verified that reducing BAG3 levels in primary neurons exacerbated pathological tau accumulation, whereas BAG3 overexpression attenuated it. These results define a tau homeostasis signature that underlies the cellular and regional vulnerability of excitatory neurons to tau pathology.

30559471|t|Tau impairs neural circuits, dominating amyloid-beta effects, in Alzheimer models in vivo.
30559471|a|The coexistence of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles in the neocortex is linked to neural system failure and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. However, the underlying neuronal mechanisms are unknown. By employing in vivo two-photon Ca2+ imaging of layer 2/3 cortical neurons in mice expressing human Abeta and tau, we reveal a dramatic tau-dependent suppression of activity and silencing of many neurons, which dominates over Abeta-dependent neuronal hyperactivity. We show that neurofibrillary tangles are neither sufficient nor required for the silencing, which instead is dependent on soluble tau. Surprisingly, although rapidly effective in tau mice, suppression of tau gene expression was much less effective in rescuing neuronal impairments in mice containing both Abeta and tau. Together, our results reveal how Abeta and tau synergize to impair the functional integrity of neural circuits in vivo and suggest a possible cellular explanation contributing to disappointing results from anti-Abeta therapeutic trials.

30559476|t|Human microglia regional heterogeneity and phenotypes determined by multiplexed single-cell mass cytometry.
30559476|a|Microglia, the specialized innate immune cells of the CNS, play crucial roles in neural development and function. Different phenotypes and functions have been ascribed to rodent microglia, but little is known about human microglia (huMG) heterogeneity. Difficulties in procuring huMG and their susceptibility to cryopreservation damage have limited large-scale studies. Here we applied multiplexed mass cytometry for a comprehensive characterization of postmortem huMG (103 - 104 cells). We determined expression levels of 57 markers on huMG isolated from up to five different brain regions of nine donors. We identified the phenotypic signature of huMG, which was distinct from peripheral myeloid cells but was comparable to fresh huMG. We detected microglia regional heterogeneity using a hybrid workflow combining Cytobank and R/Bioconductor for multidimensional data analysis. Together, these methodologies allowed us to perform high-dimensional, large-scale immunophenotyping of huMG at the single-cell level, which facilitates their unambiguous profiling in health and disease.

30559478|t|Epigenome-wide study uncovers large-scale changes in histone acetylation driven by tau pathology in aging and Alzheimer's human brains.
30559478|a|Accumulation of tau and amyloid-beta are two pathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study using the histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) mark in 669 aged human prefrontal cortices; in contrast with amyloid-beta, tau protein burden had a broad effect on the epigenome, affecting 5,990 of 26,384 H3K9ac domains. Tau-related alterations aggregated in large genomic segments reflecting spatial chromatin organization, and the magnitude of these effects correlated with the segment's nuclear lamina association. Functional relevance of these chromatin changes was demonstrated by (1) consistent transcriptional changes in three independent datasets and (2) similar findings in two mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. Finally, we found that tau overexpression in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons altered chromatin structure and that these effects could be blocked by a small molecule predicted to reverse the tau effect. Thus, we report broad tau-driven chromatin rearrangements in the aging human brain that may be reversible with heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitors.

30565432|t|On weighted composite scores for early Alzheimer's trials.
30565432|a|Recent research on finding appropriate composite endpoints for preclinical Alzheimer's disease has focused considerable effort on finding "optimized" weights in the construction of a weighted composite score. In this paper, several proposed methods are reviewed. Our results indicate no evidence that these methods will increase the power of the test statistics, and some of these weights will introduce biases to the study. Our recommendation is to focus on identifying more sensitive items from clinical practice and appropriate statistical analyses of a large Alzheimer's data set. Once a set of items has been selected, there is no evidence that adding weights will generate more sensitive composite endpoints.

30572184|t|Selective reduction of APP-BACE1 activity improves memory via NMDA-NR2B receptor-mediated mechanisms in aged PDAPP mice.
30572184|a|beta-Amyloid (Abeta) accumulation is an early event of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Inhibition of Abeta production by beta-secretase (BACE) has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy for AD. However, BACE inhibitors lack specificity and have had limited clinical benefit. To better study the consequences of reducing BACE metabolism, specifically of APP, we used an antibody, 2B3, that binds to APP at the BACE cleavage site, inhibiting Abeta production. 2B3 was administered either directly into the lateral ventricles or by intraperitoneal injection to (platelet-derived growth factor promoter hAPP717V (PDAPP) mice and WT mice. 2B3 reduced soluble Abeta40 and betaCTF (beta-amyloid derived C-terminal fragment) and improved memory for object-in-place associations and working memory in a foraging task in PDAPP mice. 2B3 also normalized the phosphorylation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor NR2B subunit and subsequent extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling. The importance of this NR2B pathway for OiP memory was confirmed by administering the NR2B antagonist, Ro25-6981, to 18-month-old WT. In contrast, 2B3 impaired associative recognition memory in young WT mice. These data provide novel insights into the mechanism by which selective modulation of APP metabolism by BACE influences synaptic and cognitive processes in both normal mice and aged APP transgenic mice.

30576228|t|VEGF receptor-1 modulates amyloid beta 1-42 oligomer-induced senescence in brain endothelial cells.
30576228|a|Aggregated amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain are hypothesized to trigger several downstream pathologies, including cerebrovascular dysfunction. Previous studies have shown that Abeta peptides can have antiangiogenic properties, which may contribute to vascular dysfunction in the early stages of the disease process. We have generated data showing that brain endothelial cells (ECs) exposed to toxic Abeta1-42 oligomers can readily enter a senescence phenotype. To determine the effect of Abeta oligomers on brain ECs, we treated early passaged human brain microvascular ECs and HUVECs with high MW Abeta1-42 oligomers (5 microM, for 72 h). For controls, we used no peptide treatment, 5 microM Abeta1-42 monomers, and 5 microM Abeta1-42 fibrils, respectively. Brain ECs treated with Abeta1-42 oligomers showed increased senescence-associated beta-galactosidase staining and increased senescence-associated p21/p53 expression. Treatment with either Abeta1-42 monomer or Abeta1-42 fibrils did not induce senescence in this assay. We then measured vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) expression in the Abeta1-42 oligomer-treated ECs, and these cells showed significantly increased VEGFR-1 expression and decreased VEGFR-2 levels. Overexpression of VEGFR-1 in brain ECs readily induced senescence, suggesting a direct role of VEGFR-1 signaling events in this paradigm. More importantly, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of VEGFR-1 expression in brain ECs was able to prevent up-regulation of p21 protein expression and significantly reduced induction of senescence following Abeta1-42 oligomer treatment. Our studies show that exposure to Abeta1-42 oligomers may impair vascular functions by altering VEGFR-1 expression and causing ECs to enter a senescent phenotype. Altered VEGFR expression has been documented in brains of AD patients and suggests that this pathway may play a role in AD disease pathogenesis. These studies suggest that modulating VEGFR-1 expression and signaling events could potentially prevent senescence and rejuvenate EC functions, and provides us with a novel target to pursue for prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular dysfunction in AD.-Angom, R.

30579361|t|Reactions to learning a "not elevated" amyloid PET result in a preclinical Alzheimer's disease trial.
30579361|a|BACKGROUND: The experiences of biomarker-ineligible cognitively normal persons can inform trial conduct and the translation of preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) into clinical practice. METHODS: We interviewed 33 persons whose "not elevated" brain amyloid imaging biomarker result made them ineligible for a preclinical AD trial. RESULTS: Most participants (n = 17) reported being informed that they did not demonstrate adequately elevated amyloid to qualify, whereas some (n = 14) reported being told they had no amyloid or plaques. Relief (n = 17) and disappointment related to not being able to participate (n = 12) were the most common reactions to results. Nearly all participants would have made healthy lifestyle changes if they had received an "elevated" result, would have another scan, and would participate in another AD prevention trial. CONCLUSIONS: Although some participants may misconstrue results, disclosure of a "not elevated" amyloid result in the research setting causes little behavior change; willingness to participate in AD research remains.

30580919|t|Fatty Acids Compete with Abeta in Binding to Serum Albumin by Quenching Its Conformational Flexibility.
30580919|a|Human serum albumin (HSA) has been identified as an important regulator of amyloid-beta (Abeta) fibrillization both in blood plasma and in cerebrospinal fluid. Fatty acids bind to HSA, and high serum levels of fatty acids increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease. In vitro, fatty-acid-loaded HSA (FA HSA) loses the protective effect against Abeta fibrillization, but the mechanism underlying the interference of fatty acids on Abeta-HSA interactions has been unclear. Here, we used molecular dynamics simulations to gain atomic-level insight on the weak binding of monomeric Abeta40 and Abeta42 peptides with apo and FA HSA. Consistent with recent NMR data, C-terminal residues of the Abeta peptides have the highest propensities for interacting with apo HSA. Interestingly, the Abeta binding residues of apo and FA HSA exhibit distinct patterns, which qualitatively correlate with backbone flexibility. In FA HSA, both flexibilities and Abeta binding propensities are relatively even among the three domains. In contrast, in apo HSA, domain III shows the highest flexibility and is the primary target for Abeta binding. Specifically, deformation of apo HSA creates strong binding sites within subdomain IIIb, around the interface between subdomains IIIa and IIIb, and at the cleft between domains III and I. Therefore, much like disordered proteins, HSA can take advantage of flexibility in forming promiscuous interactions with partners, until the flexibility is quenched by fatty-acid binding. Our work explains the effect of fatty acids on Abeta-HSA binding and contributes to the understanding of HSA regulation of Abeta aggregation.

30582328|t|Oligopeptides Generated by Neprilysin Degradation of beta-Amyloid Have the Highest Cu(II) Affinity in the Whole Abeta Family.
30582328|a|The catabolism of beta-amyloid (Abeta) is carried out by numerous endopeptidases including neprilysin, which hydrolyzes peptide bonds preceding positions 4, 10, and 12 to yield Abeta4-9 and a minor Abeta12- x species. Alternative processing of the amyloid precursor protein by beta-secretase also generates the Abeta11- x species. All these peptides contain a Xxx-Yyy-His sequence, also known as an ATCUN or NTS motif, making them strong chelators of Cu(II) ions. We synthesized the corresponding peptides, Phe-Arg-His-Asp-Ser-Gly-OH (Abeta4-9), Glu-Val-His-His-Gln-Lys-am (Abeta11-16), Val-His-His-Gln-Lys-am (Abeta12-16), and pGlu-Val-His-His-Gln-Lys-am (pAbeta11-16), and investigated their Cu(II) binding properties using potentiometry, and UV-vis, circular dichroism, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies. We found that the three peptides with unmodified N-termini formed square-planar Cu(II) complexes at pH 7.4 with analogous geometries but significantly varied Kd values of 6.6 fM (Abeta4-9), 9.5 fM (Abeta12-16), and 1.8 pM (Abeta11-16). Cyclization of the N-terminal Glu11 residue to the pyroglutamate species pAbeta11-16 dramatically reduced the affinity (5.8 nM). The Cu(II) affinities of Abeta4-9 and Abeta12-16 are the highest among the Cu(II) complexes of Abeta peptides. Using fluorescence spectroscopy, we demonstrated that the Cu(II) exchange between the Phe-Arg-His and Val-His-His motifs is very slow, on the order of days. These results are discussed in terms of the relevance of Abeta4-9, a major Cu(II) binding Abeta fragment generated by neprilysin, as a possible Cu(II) carrier in the brain.

30588668|t|CD11a expression distinguishes infiltrating myeloid cells from plaque-associated microglia in Alzheimer's disease.
30588668|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of age-related neurodegeneration and is characterized neuropathologically by the accumulation of insoluble beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides. In AD brains, plaque-associated myeloid (PAM) cells cluster around Abeta plaques but fail to effectively clear Abeta by phagocytosis. PAM cells were originally thought to be brain-resident microglia. However, several studies have also suggested that Abeta-induced inflammation causes peripheral monocytes to enter the otherwise immune-privileged brain. The relationship between AD progression and inflammation in the brain remains ambiguous because microglia and monocyte-derived macrophages are extremely difficult to distinguish from one another in an inflamed brain. Whether PAM cells are microglia, peripheral macrophages, or a mixture of both remains unclear. CD11a is a component of the beta2 integrin LFA1. We have determined that CD11a is highly expressed on peripheral immune cells, including macrophages, but is not expressed by mouse microglia. These expression patterns remain consistent in LPS-treated inflamed mice, as well as in two mouse models of AD. Thus, CD11a can be used as a marker to distinguish murine microglia from infiltrating peripheral immune cells. Using CD11a, we show that PAM cells in AD transgenic brains are comprised entirely of microglia. We also demonstrate a novel fluorescence-assisted quantification technique (FAQT), which reveals a significant increase in T lymphocytes, especially in the brains of female AD mice. Our findings support the notion that microglia are the lead myeloid players in AD and that rejuvenating their phagocytic potential may be an important therapeutic strategy.

30593950|t|Latent role of in vitro Pb exposure in blocking Abeta clearance and triggering epigenetic modifications.
30593950|a|Both beta-amyloid (Abeta) catabolism and epigenetic regulation play critical roles in the onset of neurodegeneration. The latter also contribute to Pb neurotoxicity. The present study explored the role of epigenetic modifiers and Abeta degradation enzymes in Pb-induced latent effects on Abeta overproduction in vitro. Our results indicated that in SH-SY5Y cells exposed to Pb, the expression of NEP and IDE remained declined during the recovery period, accompanied with abnormal increase of Abeta1-42 and amyloid oligomer. A disruption of selective global post-translational histone modifiers including the decrease of H3K9ac and H4K12ac and the induction of H3K9me2 and H3K27me2 dose dependently was also showed in recovery cells. Moreover, histone deacetylase inhibitor VPA could attenuate latent Abeta accumulation and HDAC activity induced by Pb, which might be by regulating the expression of NEP and IDE epigenetically. Overall, our results suggest sustained reduction of NEP and IDE expression in response to Pb sensitizes recovery SH-SY5Y cells to Abeta accumulation; however, administration of VPA is demonstrated to be beneficial in modulating Abeta clearance.

30595332|t|Harnessing Genetic Complexity to Enhance Translatability of Alzheimer's Disease Mouse Models: A Path toward Precision Medicine.
30595332|a|An individual's genetic makeup plays a large role in determining susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease (AD) but has largely been ignored in preclinical studies. To test the hypothesis that incorporating genetic diversity into mouse models of AD would improve translational potential, we combined a well-established mouse model of AD with a genetically diverse reference panel to generate mice that harbor identical high-risk human mutations but differ across the remainder of their genome. We first show that genetic variation profoundly modifies the impact of human AD mutations on both cognitive and pathological phenotypes. We then validate this complex AD model by demonstrating high degrees of genetic, transcriptomic, and phenotypic overlap with human AD. Overall, work here both introduces a novel AD mouse population as an innovative and reproducible resource for the study of mechanisms underlying AD and provides evidence that preclinical models incorporating genetic diversity may better translate to human disease.

30596067|t|ABCA7 genotype altered Abeta levels in cerebrospinal fluid in Alzheimer's disease without dementia.
30596067|a|Background: ATP-binding cassette transporter A7 (ABCA7) rs3764650 has been identified to be a susceptibility locus for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but its role in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins was still unclear. Methods: The associations of rs3764650 with CSF Abeta1-42, t-tau and p-tau were analyzed in non-dementia AD, including preclinical and prodromal AD from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Results: Finally, GG + GT genotypes significantly decreased CSF Abeta1-42 level, but did not alter CSF t-tau and p-tau levels in non-dementia AD at baseline, which was further confirmed in longitudinal studies. Conclusions: Our findings supported that ABCA7 modified AD risk by altering Abeta deposition rather than tau pathology.

30596401|t|Novel synthetic chalcone-coumarin hybrid for Abeta aggregation reduction, antioxidation, and neuroprotection.
30596401|a|BACKGROUND: Aggregation of misfolded amyloid beta (Abeta) in senile plaques causes oxidative stress and neuronal death in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Compounds possessing antiaggregation and antioxidant properties are promising candidate compounds for AD treatment. METHODS: We examined the potential of synthetic derivatives of licochalcone A and coumarin for inhibiting Abeta aggregation, scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), and providing neuroprotection by using biochemical assays and Tet-On Abeta-GFP 293/SH-SY5Y cell models for AD. RESULTS: Among test compounds, LM-031, a novel chalcone-coumarin hybrid, inhibited Abeta aggregation and scavenged free oxygen radicals. LM-031 markedly reduced Abeta misfolding and ROS as well as promoted neurite outgrowth and inhibited acetylcholinesterase in Tet-On Abeta-GFP 293/SH-SY5Y cells. Mechanistic studies showed upregulation of the HSPB1 chaperone, NRF2/NQO1/GCLC pathway, and CREB/BDNF/BCL2 pathway. Decreased neurite outgrowth upon the induction of Abeta-GFP was rescued by LM-031, which was counteracted by knockdown of HSPB1, NRF2, or CREB. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these findings demonstrate that LM-031 exhibited antiaggregation, antioxidant, and neuroprotective effects against Abeta toxicity by enhancing HSPB1 and the NRF2-related antioxidant pathway as well as by activating the CREB-dependent survival and antiapoptosis pathway. These results imply that LM-031 may be a new therapeutic compound for AD.

30598546|t|Structural basis of Notch recognition by human gamma-secretase.
30598546|a|Aberrant cleavage of Notch by gamma-secretase leads to several types of cancer, but how gamma-secretase recognizes its substrate remains unknown. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of human gamma-secretase in complex with a Notch fragment at a resolution of 2.7 A. The transmembrane helix of Notch is surrounded by three transmembrane domains of PS1, and the carboxyl-terminal beta-strand of the Notch fragment forms a beta-sheet with two substrate-induced beta-strands of PS1 on the intracellular side. Formation of the hybrid beta-sheet is essential for substrate cleavage, which occurs at the carboxyl-terminal end of the Notch transmembrane helix. PS1 undergoes pronounced conformational rearrangement upon substrate binding. These features reveal the structural basis of Notch recognition and have implications for the recruitment of the amyloid precursor protein by gamma-secretase.

30602936|t|Simulating the effect of formation of amyloid plaques on aggregation of tau protein.
30602936|a|In this paper, we develop a mathematical model that enables the investigation of the production and intracellular transport of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and tau protein in a neuron. We also investigate the aggregation of APP fragments into amyloid-beta (Abeta) as well as tau aggregation into tau oligomers and neurofibrillary tangles. Using the developed model, we investigate how Abeta aggregation can influence tau transport and aggregation in both the soma and the axon. We couple the Abeta and tau agglomeration processes by assuming that the value of the kinetic constant that describes the autocatalytic growth (self-replication) reaction step of tau aggregation is proportional to the Abeta concentration. The model predicts that APP and tau are distributed differently in the axon. While APP has a uniform distribution along the axon, tau's concentration first decreases and then increases towards the synapse. Abeta is uniformly produced along the axon while misfolded tau protein is mostly produced in the proximal axon. The number of Abeta and tau polymers originating from the axon is much smaller than the number of Abeta and tau polymers originating from the soma. The rate of production of misfolded tau polymers depends on how strongly their production is facilitated by Abeta.

30618606|t|Effects of APOE Genotype on Brain Proteomic Network and Cell Type Changes in Alzheimer's Disease.
30618606|a|Polymorphic alleles in the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene are the main genetic determinants of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. Individuals carrying the APOE E4 allele are at increased risk to develop AD compared to those carrying the more common E3 allele, whereas those carrying the E2 allele are at decreased risk for developing AD. How ApoE isoforms influence risk for AD remains unclear. To help fill this gap in knowledge, we performed a comparative unbiased mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of post-mortem brain cortical tissues from pathologically-defined AD or control cases of different APOE genotypes. Control cases (n = 10) were homozygous for the common E3 allele, whereas AD cases (n = 24) were equally distributed among E2/3, E3/3, and E4/4 genotypes. We used differential protein expression and co-expression analytical approaches to assess how changes in the brain proteome are related to APOE genotype. We observed similar levels of amyloid-beta, but reduced levels of neurofibrillary tau, in E2/3 brains compared to E3/3 and E4/4 AD brains. Weighted co-expression network analysis revealed 33 modules of co-expressed proteins, 12 of which were significantly different by APOE genotype in AD. The modules that were significantly different by APOE genotype were associated with synaptic transmission and inflammation, among other biological processes. Deconvolution and analysis of brain cell type changes revealed that the E2 allele suppressed homeostatic and disease-associated cell type changes in astrocytes, microglia, oligodendroglia, and endothelia. The E2 allele-specific effect on brain cell type changes was validated in a separate cohort of 130 brains. Our systems-level proteomic analyses of AD brain reveal alterations in the brain proteome and brain cell types associated with allelic variants in APOE, and suggest further areas for investigation into the upstream mechanisms that drive ApoE-associated risk for AD.

30638607|t|How Fluorescent Tags Modify Oligomer Size Distributions of the Alzheimer Peptide.
30638607|a|Within the complex aggregation process of amyloidogenic peptides into fibrils, early stages of aggregation play a central role and reveal fundamental properties of the underlying mechanism of aggregation. In particular, low-molecular-weight aggregates of the Alzheimer amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) have attracted increasing interest because of their role in cytotoxicity and neuronal apoptosis, typical of aggregation-related diseases. One of the main techniques used to characterize oligomeric stages is fluorescence spectroscopy. To this end, Abeta peptide chains are functionalized with fluorescent tags, often covalently bound to the disordered N-terminus region of the peptide, with the assumption that functionalization and presence of the fluorophore will not modify the process of self-assembly nor the final fibrillar structure. In this investigation, we systematically study the effects of four of the most commonly used fluorophores on the aggregation of Abeta (1-40). Time-resolved and single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy have been chosen to monitor the oligomer populations at different fibrillation times, and transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and x-ray diffraction to investigate the structure of mature fibrils. Although the structures of the fibrils were only slightly affected by the fluorescent tags, the sizes of the detected oligomeric species varied significantly depending on the chosen fluorophore. In particular, we relate the presence of high-molecular-weight oligomers of Abeta (1-40) (as found for the fluorophores HiLyte 647 and Atto 655) to net-attractive, hydrophobic fluorophore-peptide interactions, which are weak in the case of HiLyte 488 and Atto 488. The latter leads for Abeta (1-40) to low-molecular-weight oligomers only, which is in contrast to Abeta (1-42). The disease-relevant peptide Abeta (1-42) displays high-molecular-weight oligomers even in the absence of significant attractive fluorophore-peptide interactions. Hence, our findings reveal the potentially high impact of the properties of fluorophores on transient aggregates, which needs to be included in the interpretation of experimental data of oligomers of fluorescently labeled peptides.

30646141|t|Adolescent Cognitive Aptitudes and Later-in-Life Alzheimer Disease and Related Disorders.
30646141|a|Importance: Low early-life cognitive ability is a potential early marker of dementia risk in later life. Previous studies use only global measures of general intelligence and/or study this relationship in gender-specific samples. The contribution of early-life performance on specific cognitive abilities, such as language, reasoning, and visualization aptitudes, to indicating future dementia risk is unknown. Objectives: To investigate the association between adolescent cognitive ability and Medicare-recorded Alzheimer disease and related disorders (ADRD) using both general and specific measures of cognitive ability and to explore these associations separately in men and women. Design, Setting, and Participants: Population-based cohort study from the Project Talent-Medicare linked data set, a linkage of adolescent sociobehavioral data collected from high school students in 1960 to participants' 2012 to 2013 Medicare Claims and expenditures data. The association between adolescent cognitive ability and risk of ADRD in later life was assessed in a diverse sample of 43 014 men and 42 749 women aged 66 to 73 years using a series of logistic regressions stratified by sex, accounting for demographic characteristics, adolescent socioeconomic status, and regional effects. Data analysis was conducted from November 2017 to March 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Presence of Medicare-reported ADRD. Results: Overall, 1239 men (2.9%) and 1416 women (3.3%) developed ADRD. Lower mechanical reasoning was associated with increased odds of ADRD in men (odds ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.05-1.29), and lower memory for words in adolescence was associated with increased odds of ADRD in women (odds ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.05-1.28). Lower performance on several other language, reasoning, visualization, and mathematic aptitudes in adolescence showed prominent, but weaker, associations with odds of ADRD. Conclusions and Relevance: This work contributes to the understanding of early-life origins of ADRD risk. The results suggest specific measures of cognitive ability may contribute to very early identification of at-risk subgroups who may benefit from prevention or intervention efforts.

30662893|t|gamma-Secretase Studied by Atomistic Molecular Dynamics Simulations: Global Dynamics, Enzyme Activation, Water Distribution and Lipid Binding.
30662893|a|gamma-secretase, an intramembrane-cleaving aspartyl protease is involved in the cleavage of a large number of intramembrane proteins. The most prominent substrate is the amyloid precursor protein, whose proteolytic processing leads to the production of different amyloid Abeta peptides. These peptides are known to form toxic aggregates and may play a key role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, the three-dimensional structure of gamma-secretase has been determined via Cryo-EM, elucidating the spatial geometry of this enzyme complex in different functional states. We have used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the global dynamics and conformational transitions of gamma-secretase, as well as the water and lipid distributions in and around the transmembrane domains in atomic detail. Simulations were performed on the full enzyme complex and on the membrane embedded parts alone. The simulations revealed global motions compatible with the experimental enzyme structures and indicated little dependence of the dynamics of the transmembrane domains on the soluble extracellular subunits. During the simulation on the membrane spanning part a transition between an inactive conformation (with catalytic residues far apart) toward a putatively active form (with catalytic residues in close proximity) has been observed. This conformational change is associated with a distinct rearrangement of transmembrane helices, a global compaction of the catalytically active presenilin subunit a change in the water structure near the active site and a rigidification of the protein fold. The observed conformational rearrangement allows the interpretation of the effect of several mutations on the activity of gamma-secretase. A number of long-lived lipid binding sites could be identified on the membrane spanning surface of gamma-secretase which may coincide with association regions of hydrophobic membrane helices to form putative substrate binding exosites.

30711677|t|Amyloid deposition is associated with different patterns of hippocampal connectivity in men versus women.
30711677|a|Compared to men, women are disproportionally affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD) and have an accelerated trajectory of cognitive decline and disease progression. Neurobiological factors underlying gender differences in AD remain unclear. This study investigated brain beta-amyloid (Abeta)-related neural system differences in cognitively normal older men and women (N = 61; 41 females, 65-93 years old). We found that men and women showed different associations between Abeta load and hippocampal functional connectivity. During associative memory encoding, in men greater Abeta burden was accompanied by greater hippocampus-prefrontal connectivity (i.e., more synchronized activities), whereas in women hippocampal connectivity did not vary by Abeta burden. For resting-state data, the interaction of gender x Abeta on hippocampal connectivity did not survive multiple comparison in the whole-brain analyses. In the region of interest-based analyses, resting-state hippocampal-prefrontal connectivity was positively correlated with Abeta load in men and was negatively correlated with Abeta load in women. The observed Abeta-related neural differences may explain the accelerated trajectory of cognitive decline and AD progression in women.

30713632|t|Photoactive chlorin e6 is a multifunctional modulator of amyloid-beta aggregation and toxicity via specific interactions with its histidine residues.
30713632|a|The self-assembly of Abeta to beta-sheet-rich neurotoxic oligomers is a main pathological event leading to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Selective targeting of Abeta oligomers without affecting other functional proteins is therefore an attractive approach to prevent the disease and its progression. In this study, we report that photodynamic treatment of Abeta in the presence of catalytic amounts of chlorin e6 can selectively damage Abeta and inhibit its aggregation and toxicity. Chlorin e6 also reversed the amyloid aggregation process in the dark by binding its soluble and low molecular weight oligomers, as shown by thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence and photoinduced cross-linking of unmodified protein (PICUP) methods. Using HSQC NMR spectroscopy, ThT assays, amino acid analysis, SDS/PAGE, and EPR spectroscopy, we show that catalytic amounts of photoexcited chlorin e6 selectively damage the Abeta histidine residues H6, H13, and H14, and induce Abeta cross-linking by generating singlet oxygen. In contrast, photoexcited chlorin e6 was unable to cross-link ubiquitin and alpha-synuclein, demonstrating its high selectivity for Abeta. By binding to the Abeta histidine residues, catalytic amounts of chlorin e6 can also inhibit the Cu2+-induced aggregation and toxicity in darkness, while at stoichiometric amounts it acts as a chelator to reduce the amount of free Cu2+. This study demonstrates the great potential of chlorin e6 as a multifunctional agent for treatment of AD, and shows that the three N-terminal Abeta histidine residues are a suitable target for Abeta-specific drugs.

30842826|t|A catalytic antioxidant for limiting amyloid-beta peptide aggregation and reactive oxygen species generation.
30842826|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifaceted disease that is characterized by increased oxidative stress, metal-ion dysregulation, and the formation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregates. In this work we report the large affinity binding of the iron(iii) 2,17-bis-sulfonato-5,10,15-tris(pentafluorophenyl)corrole complex FeL1 to the Abeta peptide (K d ~ 10-7) and the ability of the bound FeL1 to act as a catalytic antioxidant in both the presence and absence of Cu(ii) ions. Specific findings are that: (a) an Abeta histidine residue binds axially to FeL1; (b) that the resulting adduct is an efficient catalase; (c) this interaction restricts the formation of high molecular weight peptide aggregates. UV-Vis and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies show that although the binding of FeL1 does not influence the Abeta-Cu(ii) interaction (K d ~ 10-10), bound FeL1 still acts as an antioxidant thereby significantly limiting reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation from Abeta-Cu. Overall, FeL1 is shown to bind to the Abeta peptide, and modulate peptide aggregation. In addition, FeL1 forms a ternary species with Abeta-Cu(ii) and impedes ROS generation, thus showing the promise of discrete metal complexes to limit the toxicity pathways of the Abeta peptide.

31458095|t|Metal Binding to Abeta Peptides Inhibits Interaction with Cytochrome c: Insights from Abiological Constructs.
31458095|a|Abeta(1-40) peptide is mutated to introduce cysteine residue to allow formation of organized self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on Au electrodes. Three mutants of this peptide are produced, which vary in the position of the inserted cysteine residue. Fourier transform infrared data on these peptide SAMs show the presence of both alpha helices and beta sheet in these Abeta constructs. These peptide constructs interact with cytochrome c (Cytc), allowing electron transfer between Cytc and the electrode via the Abeta peptides. Binding of metals like Zn2+ or Cu2+ induces changes in the morphologies of these assemblies, making them fold, which inhibits their spontaneous interaction with Cytc.

31458243|t|Tyrosine Rotamer States in Beta Amyloid: Signatures of Aggregation and Fibrillation.
31458243|a|During the early stages of beta amyloid (Ab) peptide aggregation, toxic oligomers form which have been recognized as a likely cause of Alzheimer's disease. In this work, we use fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulation to study the amorphous aggregation of the peptide as well as model beta-sheet protofibril structures. In particular, we study the rotamer states of the single fluorescent tyrosine (Tyr) residue present in each Ab. We find that the occupation of the four previously identified rotamers is different for monomeric and amorphous aggregates because of the differing environments of the Tyr side-chains. Surprisingly, we also identify two new rotamers that uniquely appear for the beta-sheet structures, so that together the rotamers provide distinct signatures for the different stages of aggregation and fibrillation. We propose that these rotamers could be identified in fluorescence spectroscopy, with each rotamer having a distinct fluorescence lifetime because of its different exposures to the solvent. The identification of the two new rotamers therefore provides a new means to probe amyloid formation kinetics and to monitor the effect of additives including prospective drugs.
