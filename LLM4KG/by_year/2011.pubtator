19233513|t|Thiamine deficiency increases beta-secretase activity and accumulation of beta-amyloid peptides.
19233513|a|Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) and the activities of thiamine-dependent enzymes are reduced in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between thiamine deficiency (TD) and amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing in both cellular and animal models of TD. In SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells overexpressing APP, TD promoted maturation of beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and increased beta-secretase activity which resulted in elevated levels of beta-amyloid (Abeta) as well as beta-secretase cleaved C-terminal fragment (beta-CTF). An inhibitor of beta-secretase efficiently reduced TD-induced up-regulation of Abeta and beta-CTF. Importantly, thiamine supplementation reversed the TD-induced alterations. Furthermore, TD treatment caused a significant accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS); antioxidants suppressed ROS production and maturation of BACE1, as well as TD-induced Abeta accumulation. On the other hand, exogenous Abeta(1-40) enhanced TD-induced production of ROS. A study on mice indicated that TD also caused Abeta accumulation in the brain, which was reversed by thiamine supplementation. Taken together, our study suggests that TD could enhance Abeta generation by promoting beta-secretase activity, and the accumulation of Abeta subsequently exacerbated TD-induced oxidative stress.

19249128|t|Effects of amyloid-beta peptides on the serotoninergic 5-HT1A receptors in the rat hippocampus.
19249128|a|A recent [(18)F]MPPF-positron emission tomography study has highlighted an overexpression of 5-HT(1A) receptors in the hippocampus of patients with mild cognitive impairment compared to a decrease in those with Alzheimer's disease (AD) [Truchot, L., Costes, S.N., Zimmer, L., Laurent, B., Le Bars, D., Thomas-Anterion, C., Croisile, B., Mercier, B., Hermier, M., Vighetto, A., Krolak-Salmon, P., 2007. Up-regulation of hippocampal serotonin metabolism in mild cognitive impairment. Neurology 69 (10), 1012-1017]. We used in vivo and in vitro neuroimaging to evaluate the longitudinal effects of injecting amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides (1-40) into the dorsal hippocampus of rats. In vivo microPET imaging showed no significant change in [(18)F]MPPF binding in the dorsal hippocampus over time, perhaps due to spatial resolution. However, in vitro autoradiography with [(18)F]MPPF (which is antagonist) displayed a transient increase in 5-HT(1A) receptor density 7 days after Abeta injection, whereas [(18)F]F15599 (a radiolabelled 5-HT(1A) agonist) binding was unchanged suggesting that the overexpressed 5-HT(1A) receptors were in a non-functional state. Complementary histology revealed a loss of glutamatergic neurons and an intense astroglial reaction at the injection site. Although a neurogenesis process cannot be excluded, we propose that Abeta injection leads to a transient astroglial overexpression of 5-HT(1A) receptors in compensation for the local neuronal loss. Exploration of the functional consequences of these serotoninergic modifications during the neurodegenerative process may have an impact on therapeutics targeting 5-HT(1A) receptors in AD.

19282067|t|Antiphospholipid syndrome induction exacerbates a transgenic Alzheimer disease model on a female background.
19282067|a|The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is characterized by antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) and vascular brain disease which is often associated with dementia. We examined the neurodegenerative pathological processes underlying APS by inducing APS in a transgenic animal model of Alzheimer's disease. Female C57B6/SJL mice carrying the APP(695)SWE mutation (Tg2576) and wild-type (wt) controls were immunized with beta2-glycoprotein-I (APS mice) or adjuvant alone (controls) at 4 months of age. At the age of 8 months the APP-APS mice developed high levels of aPL associated with motor hypoactivity in a staircase test (p<0.03 by t-test) and impaired performance in the cognitive T-maze (p<0.02 for main effect of treatment by repeated measures ANOVA) relative to APP-CFA mice and controls. wt-APS and wt-control did not differ significantly in their behavior or cognition. Histological studies revealed mature plaques only in the APP-APS group which also had higher amyloid load and number of activated microglia compared to all other groups. The results indicate a significant interaction between APP genotype and the induction of APS on a female background. The mechanisms involved may also be important in human APS-AD co-morbidity.

19297055|t|Membrane cholesterol enrichment prevents Abeta-induced oxidative stress in Alzheimer's fibroblasts.
19297055|a|A growing body of evidence implicates low membrane cholesterol in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we show that Abeta42 soluble oligomers accumulate more slowly and in reduced amount at the plasma membranes of PS-1L392V and APPV717I fibroblasts from familial AD (FAD) patients enriched in cholesterol content than at the counterpart membranes. The Abeta42-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the increase in membrane lipoperoxidation were also prevented by high membrane cholesterol, thus resulting in a higher resistance to amyloid toxicity with respect to control fibroblasts. On the other hand, the recruitment of amyloid assemblies to the plasma membrane of cholesterol-depleted fibroblasts was significantly increased, thus triggering an earlier and sharper production of ROS and a higher membrane oxidative injury. These results identify membrane cholesterol as being key to Abeta42 oligomer accumulation at the cell surfaces and to the following Abeta42-induced cell death in AD neurons.

19324459|t|Stereospecific interactions are necessary for Alzheimer disease amyloid-beta toxicity.
19324459|a|Previous studies suggest membrane binding is a key determinant of amyloid beta (Abeta) neurotoxicity. However, it is unclear whether this interaction is receptor driven. To address this issue, a D-handed enantiomer of Abeta42 (D-Abeta42) was synthesized and its biophysical and neurotoxic properties were compared to the wild-type Abeta42 (L-Abeta42). The results showed D- and L-Abeta42 are chemically equivalent with respect to copper binding, generation of reactive oxygen species and aggregation profiles. Cell binding studies show both peptides bound to cultured cortical neurons. However, only L-Abeta42 was neurotoxic and inhibited long term potentiation indicating L-Abeta42 requires a stereospecific target to mediate toxicity. We identified the lipid phosphatidylserine, as a potential target. Annexin V, which has very high affinity for externalized phosphatidylserine, significantly inhibited L-Abeta42 but not D-Abeta42 binding to the cultured cortical neurons and significantly rescued L-Abeta42 neurotoxicity. This suggests that Abeta mediated toxicity in Alzheimer disease is dependent upon Abeta binding to phosphatidylserine on neuronal cells.

19329226|t|PIB binding in aged primate brain: enrichment of high-affinity sites in humans with Alzheimer's disease.
19329226|a|Aged nonhuman primates accumulate large amounts of human-sequence amyloid beta (Abeta) in the brain, yet they do not manifest the full phenotype of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To assess the biophysical properties of Abeta that might govern its pathogenic potential in humans and nonhuman primates, we incubated the benzothiazole imaging agent Pittsburgh Compound B (PIB) with cortical tissue homogenates from normal aged humans, humans with AD, and from aged squirrel monkeys, rhesus monkeys, and chimpanzees with cerebral Abeta-amyloidosis. Relative to humans with AD, high-affinity PIB binding is markedly reduced in cortical extracts from aged nonhuman primates containing levels of insoluble Abeta similar to those in AD. The high-affinity binding of PIB may be selective for a pathologic, human-specific conformation of multimeric Abeta, and thus could be a useful experimental tool for clarifying the unique predisposition of humans to Alzheimer's disease.

19344981|t|Lack of evidence to support the association of polymorphisms within the alpha- and beta-secretase genes (ADAM10/BACE1) with Alzheimer's disease.
19344981|a|Cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) occurs through either an amyloidogenic or a non-amyloidogenic pathway. The first results in the generation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) and is initiated through cleavage by the beta-site amyloid beta A4 precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). The second precludes the formation of Abeta through cleavage by alpha-secretase, an enzyme's activity demonstrated in a disintegrin metalloproteinase, ADAM10. To assess the contribution of variants in the BACE1 and ADAM10 genes we used a detailed fine mapping approach. Genotyping of 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms covering the complete BACE1 gene, and 27 covering the entire ADAM10 gene, revealed no single-marker or haplotypic association with AD. We conclude that, in this present study, neither ADAM10 nor BACE1 present with any evidence to suggest that they are major candidate genes involved in conferring risk for AD.

19398247|t|Impaired neurogenesis, neuronal loss, and brain functional deficits in the APPxPS1-Ki mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
19398247|a|Amyloid-beta peptide species accumulating in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease are assumed to have a neurotoxic action and hence to be key actors in the physiopathology of this neurodegenerative disease. We have studied a new mouse mutant (APPxPS1-Ki) line developing both early-onset brain amyloid-beta deposition and, in contrast to most of transgenic models, subsequent neuronal loss. In 6-month-old mice, we observed cell layer atrophies in the hippocampus, together with a dramatic decrease in neurogenesis and a reduced brain blood perfusion as measured in vivo by magnetic resonance imaging. In these mice, neurological impairments and spatial hippocampal dependent memory deficits were also substantiated and worsened with aging. We described here a phenotype of APPxPS1-Ki mice that summarizes several neuroanatomical alterations and functional deficits evocative of the human pathology. Such a transgenic model that displays strong face validity might be highly beneficial to future research on AD physiopathogeny and therapeutics.

19540623|t|beta-Amyloid impairs axonal BDNF retrograde trafficking.
19540623|a|The neurotrophin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), is essential for synaptic function, plasticity and neuronal survival. At the axon terminal, when BDNF binds to its receptor, tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB), the signal is propagated along the axon to the cell body, via retrograde transport, regulating gene expression and neuronal function. Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by early impairments in synaptic function that may result in part from neurotrophin signaling deficits. Growing evidence suggests that soluble beta-amyloid (Abeta) assemblies cause synaptic dysfunction by disrupting both neurotransmitter and neurotrophin signaling. Utilizing a novel microfluidic culture chamber, we demonstrate a BDNF retrograde signaling deficit in AD transgenic mouse neurons (Tg2576) that can be reversed by gamma-secretase inhibitors. Using BDNF-GFP, we show that BDNF-mediated TrkB retrograde trafficking is impaired in Tg2576 axons. Furthermore, Abeta oligomers alone impair BDNF retrograde transport. Thus, Abeta reduces BDNF signaling by impairing axonal transport and this may underlie the synaptic dysfunction observed in AD.

19570594|t|PAT1 induces cell death signal and SET mislocalization into the cytoplasm by increasing APP/APLP2 at the cell surface.
19570594|a|The cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by caspases unmasks a domain extending from membrane to caspase cleavage site. This domain induces apoptosis in vitro and in vivo when overexpressed in neurons through the help of an internalization vector. In this model, we previously showed that SET rapidly binds to the internalized domain and is involved in downstream deleterious effects. Under these conditions SET mislocalizes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, as in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this report using the same model, we show that PAT1 attaches to the internalized domain earlier than SET and that this binding causes an increase in the levels of APP and APLP2 at the cell surface. Down regulation experiments of PAT1 and of APP and APLP2 show that the increase of the levels of APP and APLP2 at the cell surface triggers the cell death signal and SET mislocalization into the cytoplasm. In the context of AD these data suggest that mislocalization of SET into the cytoplasm may occur downstream of first cell death signal events involving PAT1 protein.

19604603|t|A novel pathway for amyloid precursor protein processing.
19604603|a|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) can be proteolytically processed along two pathways, the amyloidogenic that leads to the formation of the 40-42 amino acid long Alzheimer-associated amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide and the non-amyloidogenic in which APP is cut in the middle of the Abeta domain thus precluding Abeta formation. Using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry we have shown that Abeta is present in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as several shorter isoforms in addition to Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42. To address the question by which processing pathways these shorter isoforms arise, we have developed a cell model that accurately reflects the Abeta isoform pattern in CSF. Using this model, we determined changes in the Abeta isoform pattern induced by alpha-, beta-, and gamma-secretase inhibitor treatment. All isoforms longer than and including Abeta1-17 were gamma-secretase dependent whereas shorter isoforms were gamma-secretase independent. These shorter isoforms, including Abeta1-14 and Abeta1-15, were reduced by treatment with alpha- and beta-secretase inhibitors, which suggests the existence of a third and previously unknown APP processing pathway involving concerted cleavages of APP by alpha- and beta-secretase.

19628305|t|Endogenous Abeta causes cell death via early tau hyperphosphorylation.
19628305|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by Abeta overproduction and tau hyperphosphorylation. We report that an early, transient and site-specific AD-like tau hyperphosphorylation at Ser262 and Thr231 epitopes is temporally and causally related with an activation of the endogenous amyloidogenic pathway that we previously reported in hippocampal neurons undergoing cell death upon NGF withdrawal [Matrone, C., Ciotti, M.T., Mercanti, D., Marolda, R., Calissano, P., 2008b. NGF and BDNF signaling control amyloidogenic route and Ab production in hippocampal neurons. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 105, 13138-13143]. Such tau hyperphosphorylation, as well as apoptotic death, is (i) blocked by 4G8 and 6E10 Abeta antibodies or by specific beta and/or gamma-secretases inhibitors; (ii) temporally precedes tau cleavage mediated by a delayed (6-12h after NGF withdrawal) activation of caspase-3 and calpain-I; (iii) under control of Akt-GSK3beta-mediated signaling. Finally, we show that such site-specific tau hyperphosphorylation causes tau detachment from microtubules and an impairment of mitochondrial trafficking. These results depict, for the first time, a rapid interplay between endogenous Abeta and tau post-translational modifications which act co-ordinately to compromise neuronal functions in the same neuronal system, under physiological conditions as seen in AD brain.

19748159|t|Progression from MCI to AD: predictive value of CSF Abeta42 is modified by APOE genotype.
19748159|a|OBJECTIVE: To study CSF biomarkers amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta42) and total tau (tau) in relation to APOE genotype in their ability to predict progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: In 100 MCI patients CSF Abeta42, tau and APOE genotype were determined. At follow-up of 18 (13-24) months 58 patients remained non-progressive and 42 progressed to AD. RESULTS: Cox proportional hazards models showed an interaction between Abeta42 and APOE genotype (p<0.05). Stratification for APOE revealed HR (95% CI) for abnormal Abeta42 of 8.2 (2.1-31.9) for epsilon4 non-carriers, 3.9 (0.8-18.5) for heterozygotes and 0.3 (0.0-1.7) for homozygotes. Inversely, stratification for Abeta42 revealed that in patients with normal levels of Abeta42, epsilon4 homozygotes had a strongly increased risk of progression to AD with HR (95% CI) 20.8 (2.4-182.8). Tau and APOE independently predicted progression to AD. CONCLUSIONS: Abeta42 was a stronger predictor of progression to AD in APOE epsilon4 non-carriers than in carriers. Furthermore, the risk of progression for epsilon4 homozygotes was very high, also in patients with normal levels of Abeta42.

19773092|t|Cystatin C is released in association with exosomes: a new tool of neuronal communication which is unbalanced in Alzheimer's disease.
19773092|a|It has recently become clear that proteins associated with neurodegenerative disorders can be selectively incorporated into intraluminal vesicles of multivesicular bodies and subsequently released within exosomes. Multiple lines of research support a neuroprotective role for cystatin C in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Herein we demonstrate that cystatin C, a protein targeted to the classical secretory pathway by its signal peptide sequence, is also secreted by mouse primary neurons in association with exosomes. Immunoproteomic analysis using SELDI-TOF MS revealed the presence in exosomes of at least 9 different cystatin C glycoforms. Moreover, the over-expression of familial AD-associated presenilin 2 mutations (PS2 M239I and PS2 T122R) resulted in reduced levels of all cystatin C forms (native and glycosylated) and of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) metabolites within exosomes. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved in exosomal processing and release may have important implications for the fight against AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

19781815|t|Reduced levels of IgM autoantibodies against N-truncated pyroglutamate Abeta in plasma of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
19781815|a|In the present work, we investigated the level of IgM autoantibodies directed against different Abeta epitopes as potential diagnostic biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Anti-Abeta autoantibody levels were measured in 75 plasma samples from patients with AD, individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy age- and sex-matched controls (HC). To validate the presence of anti-Abeta IgMs, pooled plasma samples were subjected to gel-filtration analysis. The mean level of pGluAbeta-IgM (N-terminal truncated starting at position three with pyroglutamate) was significantly decreased in AD patients as compared to HC. In the group of MCI patients there was a significant positive correlation between pGluAbeta-IgM and cognitive decline analyzed by MMSE (rho = 0.58, d.f. = 13, p = 0.022). These observations indicate that the level of IgM autoantibodies against pGluAbeta is a promising plasma biomarker for AD and correlates with the cognitive status of individuals at risk to develop AD.

19796846|t|Glucose metabolism and PIB binding in carriers of a His163Tyr presenilin 1 mutation.
19796846|a|Six young related pre-symptomatic carriers of a His163Tyr mutation in the presenilin 1 gene who will develop early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (eoFAD), and a control group of 23 non-carriers underwent (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET). The mutation carriers were followed-up after 2 years. Multivariate analysis showed clear separation of carriers from non-carriers on both occasions, with the right thalamus being the region contributing most to group differentiation. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) revealed in the carriers non-significantly lower thalamic cerebral glucose metabolism (CMRglc) at baseline and significantly decreased CMRglc in the right thalamus at follow-up. One mutation carrier was followed-up with FDG PET 10 years after baseline and showed reductions in cognition and CMRglc in the posterior cingulate and the frontal cortex. This subject was diagnosed with AD 1 year later and assessed with an additional FDG as well as an (11)C-PIB PET scan 12 years after baseline. Global cortical CMRglc and cognition were distinctly decreased. PIB binding was comparable with sporadic AD patterns but showing slightly higher striatal levels.

19828212|t|Abnormal neuronal networks and seizure susceptibility in mice overexpressing the APP intracellular domain.
19828212|a|Alterations in the processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) lead to familial Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD patients exhibit increased seizure susceptibility and alterations in their EEGs, which suggests that APP and its metabolites may modulate neuronal networks. Here we demonstrate that transgenic mice overexpressing APP intracellular domain (AICD) and its binding partner Fe65 exhibit abnormal spiking events and a susceptibility to induced seizures. These abnormalities are not observed in PDAPP(D664A) mice, which express high Abeta levels but harbor a mutation in the APP intracellular domain. These data suggest that alterations in the levels of AICD contribute to network dysfunction in AD.

19888930|t|White matter lesion load increases the risk of low CSF Abeta42 in apolipoprotein E-e4 carriers attending a memory clinic.
19888930|a|BACKGROUND: White matter lesions (WMLs) are age-related manifestations of ischemic cerebrovascular disease and increase the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The apolipoprotein E (ApoE) e4 allele is a risk factor for late onset AD and has been related to low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta42 levels and to cerebrovascular disease. The present study analyzed the relationship between WMLs, ApoE-e4 genotype, and low CSF Abeta42. METHODS: A total of 235 memory clinic attenders were stratified in 3 groups according to WML load. WMLs were rated on axial T2 magnetic resonance imaging images. Group 1 had no or only small amounts of periventricular (PV) or subcortical (SC) WMLs, WML group 2 had high amounts of PV WMLs and low amounts of SC WMLs, and WML group 3 had high amounts of both PV and SC WMLs. In each WML group, ApoE-e4 genotype was used in logistic regression as a predictor for low CSF Abeta42 (cutoff<=450 ng/L). RESULTS: The odds ratio (OR) of having low CSF Abeta42 was significantly increased in the presence of ApoE-e4 only in WML group 3 (OR 3.69, P=.009). CONCLUSION: A high WML load may interact with the ApoE-e4 genotype and increase the risk for reduced CSF Abeta42 in patients attending a memory clinic.

19900216|t|Mutant presenilin-1 deregulated peripheral immunity exacerbates Alzheimer-like pathology.
19900216|a|Mutations in the presenilin-1 (PS1) gene are independent causes of familial Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD patients have dysregulated immunity, and PS1 mutant mice exhibit abnormal systemic immune responses. To test whether immune function abnormality caused by a mutant human PS1 gene (mhPS1) could modify AD-like pathology, we reconstituted immune systems of AD model mice carrying a mutant human amyloid precursor protein gene (mhAPP; Tg2576 mice) or both mhAPP and mhPS1 genes (PSAPP mice) with allogeneic bone marrow cells. Here, we report a marked reduction in amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels, beta-amyloid plaques and brain inflammatory responses in PSAPP mice following strain-matched wild-type PS1 bone marrow reconstitution. These effects occurred with immune switching from pro-inflammatory T helper (Th) 1 to anti-inflammatory Th2 immune responses in the periphery and in the brain, which likely instructed microglia to phagocytose and clear Abeta in an ex vivo assay. Conversely, Tg2576 mice displayed accelerated AD-like pathology when reconstituted with mhPS1 bone marrow. These data show that haematopoietic cells bearing the mhPS1 transgene exacerbate AD-like pathology, suggesting a novel therapeutic strategy for AD based on targeting PS1 in peripheral immune cells.

19912480|t|Vasomotor reactivity is similarly impaired in patients with Alzheimer's disease and patients with amyloid hemorrhage.
19912480|a|UNLABELLED: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) might alter cerebral hemodynamics. Impairment of vasomotor reactivity may constitute a biomarker of amyloid angiopathy and therefore it may be useful to distinguish disorders with CAA from other conditions. The aim of this study was to assess the vasomotor reactivity in two conditions characterized by CAA: Alzheimer's disease and amyloid hemorrhage. METHODS: We assessed the vasomotor using transcranial Doppler and the breath-holding method. RESULTS: Responses obtained in controls were higher than in patients with Alzheimer's or with antecedent of amyloid hemorrhage while there was no statistical difference in the comparison between these last two groups. CONCLUSION: The vasomotor reactivity seems to be similarly impaired in Alzheimer's disease and amyloid hemorrhage patients.

19954860|t|RACK1 is involved in beta-amyloid impairment of muscarinic regulation of GABAergic transmission.
19954860|a|RACK1 (receptor for activated C-kinase 1), an anchoring protein that shuttles activated PKC to cellular membranes, plays an important role in PKC-mediated signal transduction pathways. A significant loss of RACK1 has been found in the brain of aging animals and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, which implicates the potential involvement of RACK1 in altered PKC activation associated with dementia. Our previous studies have demonstrated that GABAergic inhibition in prefrontal cortex, which is important for cognitive processes like "working memory", is regulated by muscarinic receptors via a PKC-dependent mechanism, and this effect is impaired by beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta). In this study, we found that Abeta oligomers decreased RACK1 distribution in the membrane fraction of cortical neurons. Moreover, overexpression of RACK1 rescued the effect of muscarinic receptors on GABAergic transmission in Abeta-treated cortical cultures in vitro and Abeta-injected cortical neurons in vivo. These results suggest that the Abeta-induced loss of RACK1 distribution in the cell membrane may underlie the Abeta impairment of muscarinic regulation of PKC and GABAergic transmission. Thus, RACK1 provides a potential therapeutic target that can restore some of the impaired cellular processes by Abeta.

20015199|t|Temporal relationship of autophagy and apoptosis in neurons challenged by low molecular weight beta-amyloid peptide.
20015199|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an aging-related progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Previous studies suggested that various soluble Abeta species are neurotoxic and able to activate apoptosis and autophagy, the type I and type II programmed cell death, respectively. However, the sequential and functional relationships between these two cellular events remain elusive. Here we report that low molecular weight Abeta triggered cleavage of caspase 3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase to cause neuronal apoptosis in rat cortical neurons. On the other hand, Abeta activated autophagy by inducing autophagic vesicle formation and autophagy related gene 12 (ATG12), and up-regulated the lysoso-mal machinery for the degradation of autophagosomes. Moreover, we demonstrated that activation of autophagy by Abeta preceded that of apoptosis, with death associated protein kinase phosphorylation as the potential molecular link. More importantly, under Abeta toxicity, neurons exhibiting high level of autophagosome formation were absent of apoptotic features, and inhibition of autophagy by 3-methylade-nine advanced neuronal apoptosis, suggesting that autophagy can protect neurons from Abeta-induced apoptosis.

20015575|t|Fractal analysis of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease patients and mouse models.
20015575|a|The varied morphological and biochemical forms in which amyloid deposits in brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients are complex and their mechanisms of formation are not completely understood. Here we investigated the ability of fractal dimension (FD) to differentiate between the textures of commonly observed amyloid plaques in sporadic and familial AD patients and aged-control individuals as well as in transgenic mouse models of amyloidosis. Studying more than 6000 amyloid plaques immunostained for total Abeta (Abetat), Abeta40 or Abeta42, we show here that Abeta40 FD could efficiently differentiate between (i) AD patients and aged-control individuals (P<0.001); (ii) sporadic and familial AD due to presenilin-1 or APP (A692G) mutations (P<0.001); and (iii) three transgenic mouse models of different genotypes (P<0.001). Furthermore, while diffuse and dense-core plaques present in humans and transgenic mice had comparable FDs, both Abetat and Abeta42 FD could also differentiate diffuse plaques from other plaque types in both species (P<0.001). Our data suggest that plaque FD could be a valuable tool for objective, computer-oriented AD diagnosis as well as for genotype-phenotype correlations of AD.

20015576|t|Differential recognition of vascular and parenchymal beta amyloid deposition.
20015576|a|By phage display, llama-derived heavy chain antibody fragments were selected from non-immune and immune libraries and tested for their affinity and specificity for beta amyloid by phage-ELISA, immunohistochemistry and surface plasmon resonance. We identified eight distinct heavy chain antibody fragments specific for beta amyloid. While three of them recognized vascular and parenchymal beta amyloid deposits, the remaining five heavy chain antibody fragments recognized vascular beta amyloid specifically, failing to bind to parenchymal beta amyloid. These heavy chain antibody fragments, selected from different libraries, demonstrated differential affinity for different epitopes when used for immunohistochemistry. These observations indicate that the llama heavy chain antibody fragments are the first immunologic probes with the ability to differentiate between parenchymal and vascular beta amyloid aggregates. This indicates that vascular and parenchymal beta amyloid deposits are heterogeneous in epitope presence/availability. The properties of these heavy chain antibody fragments make them potential candidates for use in in vivo differential diagnosis of Alzheimer disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Continued use and characterization of these reagents will be necessary to fully understand the performance of these immunoreagents.

20031278|t|Cognitive effects of cell-derived and synthetically derived Abeta oligomers.
20031278|a|Soluble forms of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) are a molecular focus in Alzheimer's disease research. Soluble Abeta dimers ( 8 kDa), trimers ( 12 kDa), tetramers ( 16 kDa) and Abeta*56 ( 56 kDa) have shown biological activity. These Abeta molecules have been derived from diverse sources, including chemical synthesis, transfected cells, and mouse and human brain, leading to uncertainty about toxicity and potency. Herein, synthetic Abeta peptide-derived oligomers, cell- and brain-derived low-n oligomers, and Abeta*56, were injected intracerebroventricularly (icv) into rats assayed under the Alternating Lever Cyclic Ratio (ALCR) cognitive assay. Cognitive deficits were detected at 1.3 muM of synthetic Abeta oligomers and at low nanomolar concentrations of cell-secreted Abeta oligomers. Trimers, from transgenic mouse brain (Tg2576), did not cause cognitive impairment at any dose tested, whereas Abeta*56 induced concentration-dependent cognitive impairment at 0.9 and 1.3muM. Thus, while multiple forms of Abeta have cognition impairing activity, there are significant differences in effective concentration and potency.

20071041|t|Impact of small thrombus formation in restenotic bare-metal stent lesions associated with acute coronary syndrome: identification by optical coherence tomography.
20071041|a|BACKGROUND: Although in-stent restenosis (ISR) after bare-metal stent (BMS) implantation is considered to be clinically benign, ISR is often associated with adverse complications, such as acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The frequency, type, and location of thrombi in ISR lesions and their clinical presentation have not yet been precisely validated. METHODS: Thirty angiographic ISR lesions occurring within 3 to 8 months after stenting were evaluated by optical coherence tomography (OCT). A thrombus was defined as a mass protruding into the lumen with an irregular surface, and its type was divided into red or white. The maximum size of a thrombus and the longitudinal distance from the thrombus to the narrowest lumen were measured. RESULTS: A thrombus was identified in 2 patients by angiography and in 10 patients by OCT (7% vs. 33%; P=0.01). OCT showed that 9 patients had white thrombus and another patient had both types of thrombi. ACS relevant to ISR was seen in 6 patients, and the frequency of ACS was significantly higher in patients with thrombus than in those without thrombus [50% (5/10) vs. 5% (1/20); P=0.003]. The maximum size of the thrombus was 412 +- 220 microm in height, 424 +- 251 microm in width, and the longitudinal distance between the thrombus and the minimum lumen area was 0.3 +- 0.7 mm. CONCLUSIONS: One third of ISR lesions following BMS deployment dominantly contained a white thrombus, and half of them were associated with ACS. A small thrombus formation adjacent to the narrowest lumen in an ISR lesion may therefore contribute to the clinical presentation of ACS.

20097446|t|Abeta oligomers inhibit synapse remodelling necessary for memory consolidation.
20097446|a|Extensive research has implicated the amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) in the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This protein has been shown to produce memory deficits when injected into rodent brain and in mouse models of AD Abeta production is associated with impaired learning and/or recall. Here we examined the effects of cell-derived SDS-stable 7PA2-derived soluble Abeta oligomers on consolidation of avoidance learning. At 0, 3, 6, 9 or 12h after training, animals received an intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta-containing or control media and recall was tested at 24 and 48 h. Immediately after 48 h recall animals were transcardially perfused and the brain removed for sectioning and EM analysis. Rats receiving injections of Abeta at 6 or 9h post-training showed a significant impairment in memory consolidation at 48 h. Importantly, impaired animals injected at 9h had significantly fewer synapses in the dentate gyrus. These data suggest that Abeta low-n oligomers target specific temporal facets of consolidation-associated synaptic remodelling whereby loss of functional synapses results in impaired consolidation.

20122754|t|Inhibition of neuronal calcium oscillations by cell surface APP phosphorylated on T668.
20122754|a|Adenoviral expression of human APP (hAPP), but not of hAPP deleted from its C-terminal intracellular domain, in rat cortical neurons abolishes spontaneous synchronous calcium oscillations. The intracellular domain of APP695 contains several residues that can be phosphorylated. Contrary to non-neuronal cells, a very high phosphorylation of APP on T668 is observed in neurons, which is mediated by JNK, GSK3 and Cdk5 protein kinases. JNK activity, modulated by GSK3, enhances the traffic of phosphorylated APP to nerve terminals, contrary to Cdk5. Here we show that inhibition of GSK3 and JNK restores calcium oscillations in an hAPP expressing neuronal network, whereas inhibition of Cdk5 does not. Expression of mutant hAPPT668A does not inhibit calcium oscillations, and the proportion of hAPPT668A at the plasma membrane is reduced by more than 50%. Altogether, these results indicate that the intracellular domain of APP is needed to inhibit neuronal calcium oscillations because GSK3/JNK phosphorylation of T668 controls APP trafficking at the plasma membrane.

20133015|t|Early neuronal dysfunction by amyloid beta oligomers depends on activation of NR2B-containing NMDA receptors.
20133015|a|Several studies indicate that NMDA receptor signaling is involved in Abeta oligomer-mediated impairment of neuronal function and morphology. Utilizing primary neuronal cell culture and hippocampal slices from rat and mouse, we found that Abeta oligomer administration readily impairs long-term potentiation, reduces baseline synaptic transmission, decreases neuronal spontaneous network activity and induces retraction of synaptic contacts long before major cytotoxic effects are visible. Interestingly, all these effects can be blocked with the NR2B-containing NMDA-receptor antagonist ifenprodil or Ro 25-6981 suggesting that activation of downstream effectors of these receptors is involved in early detrimental actions of Abeta oligomers. In line we found that Jacob, a messenger that can couple extrasynaptic NMDA-receptor activity to CREB dephosphorylation, accumulates in the nucleus after Abeta oligomer administration and that the nuclear accumulation of Jacob can be blocked by a simultaneous application of ifenprodil. We conclude that Abeta oligomers induce early neuronal dysfunction mainly by activation of NR2B-containing NMDA-receptors.

20176414|t|Lack of association between 11C-PiB and longitudinal brain atrophy in non-demented older individuals.
20176414|a|Amyloid-beta plaques (Abeta) are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), begin deposition decades before the incipient disease, and are thought to be associated with neuronal loss, brain atrophy and cognitive impairment. We examine associations between (11)C-PiB-PET measurement of Abeta burden and brain volume changes in the preceding years in 57 non-demented individuals (age 64-86; M=78.7). Participants were prospectively followed through the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, with up to 10 consecutive MRI scans (M=8.1) and an (11)C-PiB scan approximately 10 years after the initial MRI. Linear mixed effects models were used to determine whether mean cortical (11)C-PiB distribution volume ratios, estimated by fitting a reference tissue model to the measured time activity curves, were associated with longitudinal regional brain volume changes of the whole brain, ventricular CSF, frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital white and gray matter, the hippocampus, orbito-frontal cortex, and the precuneus. Despite significant longitudinal declines in the volumes of all investigated regions (p<0.05), no associations were detected between current Abeta burden and regional brain volume decline trajectories in the preceding years, nor did the regional volume trajectories differ between those with highest and lowest Abeta burden. Consistent with a threshold model of disease, our findings suggest that Abeta load does not seem to affect brain volume changes in individuals without dementia.

20199584|t|Complement receptor 3 (CD11b/CD18) is implicated in the elimination of beta-amyloid peptides.
20199584|a|Microglia are the professional phagocytes of the brain and express phagocytic receptors such as complement receptor 3 (CR3 or CD11b/CD18). Using mimics of the amyloid deposit made of heat-killed yeasts coated with either Abeta 1-40 or Abeta 1-42, we were able to study how microglia interacted with and ingested these particles in vitro. We have shown previously that the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) is largely implied in the phagocytosis of Abeta 1-42-opsonized heat-killed yeasts and partly in that of Abeta 1-40-opsonized heat-killed yeasts. Here, we report that antibodies against CD11b or CD18 reduced the uptake of the artificial amyloid deposit by microglial cell showing that CR3 is involved in the mechanism. Moreover, a concomitant inhibition of LRP and CR3 completely blocked the ingestion of both kinds of particles suggesting that no other receptors participate to this mechanism.

20226652|t|Docosahexaenoic acid withstands the Abeta(25-35)-induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells.
20226652|a|BACKGROUND: Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6, n-3) ameliorates the memory-related learning deficits of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is characterized by fibrillar amyloid deposits in the affected brains. Here, we have investigated whether DHA-induced inhibition of Amyloid beta-peptide(25-35) (Abeta(25-35)) fibrillation limits or deteriorates the toxicity of the human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y). EXPERIMENTAL METHODS: In vitro fibrillation of Abeta(25-35) was performed in the absence or presence of DHA. Afterwards, SH-SY5Y cells were incubated with Abeta(25-35) in absence or presence 20 muM DHA to evaluate its effect on the Abeta(25-35)-induced neurotoxicity by MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide)]-redox and TUNEL (TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling) assay and immunohistochemistry. The level of Abeta(25-35)-induced lipid peroxide (LPO) was determined in the absence or presence of oligomer-specific antibody. Fatty acid profile was estimated by gas chromatography. RESULTS: DHA significantly reduced the Abeta(25-35) in vitro fibrillation, as indicated by fluorospectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Abeta(25-35) decreased the MTT-redox activity and increased the apoptotic damage and levels of LPO when compared with those of the controls. However, when the SH-SY5Y cells were treated with Abeta(25-35) in the presence of DHA, MTT redox potential significantly increased and the levels LPO decreased, suggesting an inhibition of the Abeta(25-35)-induced neurotoxicity. DHA improved the Abeta(25-35) induced DNA damage and axodendritic loss, with a concomitant increase in the cellular level of DHA, suggesting DHA protects the cell from neurotoxic degeneration. CONCLUSION: DHA not only inhibits the in vitro fibrillation but also resists the Abeta(25-35)-induced toxicity in the neuronal cells. This might be the basis of the DHA-induced amelioration of Abeta-induced neurodegeneration and related cognitive deficits.

20411345|t|Modeling effect of a gamma-secretase inhibitor on amyloid-beta dynamics reveals significant role of an amyloid clearance mechanism.
20411345|a|Aggregation of the small peptide amyloid beta (Abeta) into oligomers and fibrils in the brain is believed to be a precursor to Alzheimer's disease. Abeta is produced via multiple proteolytic cleavages of amyloid precursor protein (APP), mediated by the enzymes beta- and gamma-secretase. In this study, we examine the temporal dynamics of soluble (unaggregated) Abeta in the plasma and cerebral-spinal fluid (CSF) of rhesus monkeys treated with different oral doses of a gamma-secretase inhibitor. A dose-dependent reduction of Abeta concentration was observed within hours of drug ingestion, for all doses tested. Abeta concentration in the CSF returned to its predrug level over the monitoring period. In contrast, Abeta concentration in the plasma exhibited an unexpected overshoot to as high as 200% of the predrug concentration, and this overshoot persisted as late as 72 hours post-drug ingestion. To account for these observations, we proposed and analyzed a minimal physiological model for Abeta dynamics that could fit the data. Our analysis suggests that the overshoot arises from the attenuation of an Abeta clearance mechanism, possibly due to the inhibitor. Our model predicts that the efficacy of Abeta clearance recovers to its basal (pretreatment) value with a characteristic time of >48 hours, matching the time-scale of the overshoot. These results point to the need for a more detailed investigation of soluble Abeta clearance mechanisms and their interaction with Abeta-reducing drugs.

20563761|t|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) mRNA level is higher in the old mouse cerebral cortex and is regulated by sex steroids.
20563761|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid beta peptides, which are produced by the proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP). As the incidence of AD is higher in females and sex steroids are implicated in this disease, we have examined the effect of sex steroids (testosterone and 17beta-estradiol) on the expression of APP mRNA and protein in the cerebral cortex of adult and old mice of both sexes. Northern blot analysis detected APP mRNA as a single 3.5-kb band and its level is increased in old as compared to adult. Following gonadectomy, its level was upregulated in female mice but downregulated in male mice. Supplementation with testosterone or estradiol decreased its levels in female mice of both ages. Testosterone supplementation increased the mRNA levels in both adult and old male mice. Estrogen supplementation decreased its level in adult but increased in old male mice. Western blot analysis detected APP specific bands ranging from 95 to 125 kD. The level of 95 kDa band representing APP695 protein showed difference in levels with age or hormone treatment. These results provide evidence for increase in APP mRNA level in the cerebral cortex of old mice and its regulation by sex steroids during aging.

20599474|t|Cerebrospinal fluid profile of amyloid beta42 (Abeta42), hTau and ubiquitin in North Indian Alzheimer's disease patients.
20599474|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, and is characterized by the degeneration of neurons and their synapses, and a higher number of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) compared with that found in non-demented individuals. Amyloid-beta-peptides (Abeta) are major components of amyloid plaques in AD brain whereas NFTs are composed of Tau and associated with ubiquitin. The aim of the present study was to analyze the levels of Abeta42, hTau (total Tau) and ubiquitin in CSF of North Indian population. CSF Abeta42, Tau and ubiquitin were measured in CSF of AD patients as well as controls using ELISA assays. Here we report low Abeta42 levels in AD patients (324.24+-76.38pg/ml) as compared to those in non-AD (NAD) (668.34+-43.13pg/ml), neurological controls (NCs) (727.28+-46.49pg/ml) and healthy controls (HCs) (976.47+-124.46pg/ml). In contrast, hTau and ubiquitin levels were significantly high (568.65+-48.89pg/ml and 36.82+-4.34ng/ml, respectively) in AD patients compared to those in NAD, NC and HC. The hTau levels were 267.37+-36.64pg/ml, 167.34+-44.27pg/ml and 107.62+-24.27pg/ml in NAD, NC and HC, respectively. Similarly, ubiquitin levels were 23.57+-2.32ng/ml, 19.76+-3.64ng/ml and 13.24+-4.56ng/ml in NAD, NC and HC, respectively. In conclusion, low Abeta42 and high Tau-ubiquitin levels were found in North Indian AD patients.

20630619|t|LRP1 mediates bidirectional transcytosis of amyloid-beta across the blood-brain barrier.
20630619|a|According to the "amyloid hypothesis", the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide is the toxic intermediate driving Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Recent evidence suggests that the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) transcytoses Abeta out of the brain across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). To provide genetic evidence for LRP1-mediated transcytosis of Abeta across the BBB we analyzed Abeta transcytosis across primary mouse brain capillary endothelial cells (pMBCECs) derived from wild-type and LRP1 knock-in mice. Here, we show that pMBCECs in vitro express functionally active LRP1. Moreover, we demonstrate that LRP1 mediates transcytosis of [(125)I]-Abeta(1-40) across pMBCECs in both directions, whereas no role for LRP1-mediated Abeta degradation was detected. Analysis of [(125)I]-Abeta(1-40) transport across pMBCECs generated from mice harboring a knock-in mutation in the NPxYxxL endocytosis/sorting domain of endogenous LRP1 revealed a reduced Abeta clearance from brain-to-blood and blood-to-brain compared with wild-type derived pMBCECs. Therefore, for the first time, we present genetic evidence that LRP1 modulates the pathogenic actions of soluble Abeta in the brain by clearing Abeta across the BBB.

20655336|t|Increased aggression in males in transgenic Tg2576 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
20655336|a|Behavioural and psychological signs and symptoms of dementia encompass a wide range of neuropsychiatric disturbances which coincide with progressing cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Physical aggression and agitation, which occurs in 20-65% of AD patients, is physically and emotionally stressful, not only to patients but also to immediate family and caregivers. The exact mechanisms underlying the increased aggressive behaviour in AD has yet to be elucidated. We used a transgenic mouse model, denoted Tg2576, which over-expresses a mutated human amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene implicated in familial AD, to investigate aggressive behaviour of males at the stage of amyloid beta pathology preceding overt amyloid plaque deposition in the brain. The aggressive behaviour of transgenic and non-transgenic littermate males was evaluated in a standard resident-intruder test in which an isolated resident male responded aggressively toward an experimentally naive intruder male of A/J strain. We showed that 7-month-old Tg2576 resident males demonstrated significantly higher and unchanged level of aggression towards intruder males during 3 consecutive encounters as compared to their non-transgenic littermate counterparts. These results validate further the Tg2576 mouse model of AD underscoring its usefulness in studying non-mnemonic changes in behaviour related to the disease.

20678126|a|Intravenous agitated saline injection is useful in identifying right-to-left shunting at the atrial or intrapulmonary level. Anomalous systemic venous drainage to the left atrium is a rare but easily correctable cause of right-to-left shunting which, if left undiagnosed, may have serious consequences, including meningitis and pyogenic brain abscesses. This case illustrates an unusual cause of right-to-left shunting and the utility of venous microbubble injection in its diagnosis.

20683452|t|Reduction of beta-amyloid deposits by gamma-secretase inhibitor is associated with the attenuation of secondary damage in the ipsilateral thalamus and sensory functional improvement after focal cortical infarction in hypertensive rats.
20683452|a|Abnormal beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposits in the thalamus have been reported after cerebral cortical infarction. In this study, we investigated the association of Abeta deposits, with the secondary thalamic damage after focal cortical infarction in rats. Thirty-six stroke-prone renovascular hypertensive rats were subjected to distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and then randomly divided into MCAO, vehicle, and N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) groups and 12 sham-operated rats as control. The DAPT was administered orally at 72 hours after MCAO. Seven days after MCAO, sensory function, neuron loss, and glial activation and proliferation were evaluated using adhesive removal test, Nissl staining, and immunostaining, respectively. Thalamic Abeta accumulation was evaluated using immunostaining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Compared with vehicle group, the ipsilateral thalamic Abeta, neuronal loss, glial activation and proliferation, and the mean time to remove the stimulus from right forepaw significantly decreased in DAPT group. The mean time to remove the stimulus from the right forepaw and thalamic Abeta burden were both negatively correlated with the number of thalamic neurons. These findings suggest that Abeta deposits are associated with the secondary thalamic damage. Reduction of thalamic Abeta by gamma-secretase inhibitor may attenuate the secondary damage and improve sensory function after cerebral cortical infarction.

20688501|t|4-O-methylhonokiol attenuated beta-amyloid-induced memory impairment through reduction of oxidative damages via inactivation of p38 MAP kinase.
20688501|a|Oxidative stress induced neuronal cell death by accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) is a critical pathological mechanism of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Intracerebroventrical infusion of Abeta(1-42) (300 pmol/day per mouse) for 14 days induced neuronal cell death and memory impairment, but pre-treatment of 4-O-methylhonokiol (4-O-MH), a novel compound extracted from Magnolia officinalis for 3 weeks (0.2, 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg) prior to the infusion of Abeta(1-42) and during the infusion dose dependently improved Abeta(1-42)-induced memory impairment and prevented neuronal cell death. Additionally, 4-O-MH reduced Abeta(1-42) infusion-induced oxidative damages of protein and lipid but reduced glutathione levels in the cortex and hippocampus. Abeta(1-42) infusion-induced activation of astrocytes and p38 mitogenic activated protein (MAP) kinase was also prevented by 4-O-MH in mice brains. In further study using culture cortical neurons, p38 MAP kinase inhibitor abolished the inhibitory effect of 4-O-MH (10 muM) on the Abeta(1-42) (5 muM)-induced reactive oxidative species generation and neuronal cell death. These results suggest that 4-O-MH might prevent the development and progression of AD through the reduction of oxidative stress and neuronal cell death via inactivation of p38 MAP kinase pathway.

20701429|t|Enhanced ROS generation mediated by Alzheimer's disease presenilin regulation of InsP3R Ca2+ signaling.
20701429|a|Familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) is caused by mutations in amyloid precursor protein and presenilins (PS1, PS2). Many FAD-linked PS mutations affect intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) homeostasis by proximal mechanisms independent of amyloid production by dramatically enhancing gating of the inositol trisphosphate receptor (InsP(3)R) intracellular Ca(2+) release channel by a gain-of-function effect that mirrors genetics of FAD and is independent of secretase activity. Electrophysiological recordings of InsP(3)R in FAD patient B cells, cortical neurons of asymptomatic PS1-AD mice, and other cells revealed they have higher occupancy in a high open probability burst mode, resulting in enhanced Ca(2+) signaling. Exaggerated Ca(2+) signaling through this mechanism results in enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species, believed to be an important component in AD pathogenesis. Exaggerated Ca(2+) signaling through InsP(3)R-PS interaction is a disease specific and robust proximal mechanism in AD that may contribute to the pathology of AD by enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species.

20712397|t|Amyloid beta-peptide oligomers stimulate RyR-mediated Ca2+ release inducing mitochondrial fragmentation in hippocampal neurons and prevent RyR-mediated dendritic spine remodeling produced by BDNF.
20712397|a|Soluble amyloid beta-peptide oligomers (AbetaOs), increasingly recognized as causative agents of Alzheimer's disease (AD), disrupt neuronal Ca(2+) homeostasis and synaptic function. Here, we report that AbetaOs at sublethal concentrations generate prolonged Ca(2+) signals in primary hippocampal neurons; incubation in Ca(2+)-free solutions, inhibition of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) or N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), or preincubation with N-acetyl-l-cysteine abolished these signals. AbetaOs decreased (6 h) RyR2 and RyR3 mRNA and RyR2 protein, and promoted mitochondrial fragmentation after 24 h. NMDAR inhibition abolished the RyR2 decrease, whereas RyR inhibition prevented significantly the RyR2 protein decrease and mitochondrial fragmentation induced by AbetaOs. Incubation with AbetaOs (6 h) eliminated the RyR2 increase induced by brain-derived nerve factor (BDNF) and the dendritic spine remodeling induced within minutes by BDNF or the RyR agonist caffeine. Addition of BDNF to neurons incubated with AbetaOs for 24 h, which had RyR2 similar to and slightly higher RyR3 protein content than those of controls, induced dendritic spine growth but at slower rates than in controls. These combined effects of sublethal AbetaOs concentrations (which include redox-sensitive stimulation of RyR-mediated Ca(2+) release, decreased RyR2 protein expression, mitochondrial fragmentation, and prevention of RyR-mediated spine remodeling) may contribute to impairing the synaptic plasticity in AD.

20725737|a|Pruritus, a common feature of animal prion diseases such as scrapie, is rarely reported in humans with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), and its anatomical background is not well defined. The present study was undertaken to carry out a methodical prospective search for the prevalence of pruritus in CJD patients and investigate its anatomical substrate by MRI. The study group included consecutive familial and sporadic CJD patients carrying the E200K PRNP mutation followed up in a longitudinal prospective study between the years 2005 and 2008. Pruritus was prospectively screened for and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was used to correlate brain diffusion abnormalities with pruritus in CJD patients. Pruritus was present in 6/31 (19.35%) patients with familial disease (fCJD) and in none of the patients with sporadic disease (sCJD). Pruritus was a presenting symptom in one patient and evolved during the course of the disease in the other five patients. The pruritus was generalized in three patients, regional in two and localized in one patient. It was transient in one patient and continued throughout the disease in five patients. DWI showed that pruritus was significantly associated with reduced diffusion in the several areas known to be affected by CJD, but most significantly in the midbrain periaqueductal grey matter. Pruritus is relatively common in patients with familial CJD carrying the E200K mutation. Our findings point to a central origin that involves damage to the inhibitory gating mechanism for itch in the periaqueductal grey matter.

20731659|t|Methylene blue reduces abeta levels and rescues early cognitive deficit by increasing proteasome activity.
20731659|a|Promising results have emerged from a phase II clinical trial testing methylene blue (MB) as a potential therapeutic for Alzheimer disease (AD), where improvements in cognitive functions of AD patients after 6 months of MB administration have been reported. Despite these reports, no preclinical testing of MB in mammals has been published, and thus its mechanism of action in relation to AD pathology remains unknown. In order to elucidate the effects of MB on AD pathology and to determine its mechanism of action, we used a mouse model (3xTg-AD) that develops age-dependent accumulation of Abeta and tau and cognitive decline. Here, we report that chronic dietary MB treatment reduces Abeta levels and improves learning and memory deficits in the 3xTg-AD mice. The mechanisms underlying the effects of MB on Abeta pathology appears to be mediated by an increase in Abeta clearance as we show that MB increases the chymotrypsin- and trypsin-like activities of the proteasome in the brain. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that MB increases proteasome function and ameliorates AD-like pathology in vivo. Overall, the data presented here support the use of MB for the treatment of AD and offer a possible mechanism of action.

20732423|t|Amyloid precursor-like protein 2 cleavage contributes to neuronal intranuclear inclusions and cytotoxicity in spinocerebellar ataxia-7 (SCA7).
20732423|a|In spinocerebellar ataxia-7 (SCA7), a polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion in the ataxin-7 protein leads to the formation of neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NIIs) and neurodegeneration. In this study, amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2) was identified as a partner protein for ataxin-7. APLP2, belonging to the APP gene family, undergoes secretase and caspase cleavages and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Activated caspase-3 cleaves APP family proteins to release N-terminal fragments (NTFs) and intracellular C-terminal domains (ICDs), which can translocate into the nucleus and induce neurotoxicity in AD. Here, we report abnormal nuclear relocation of APLP2 and detection of NTFs in NIIs in SCA7. The ICDs generated by caspase-3 cleavage of APLP2 accumulate in nuclei and contribute to a cumulative toxicity when coexpressed with mutated ataxin-7. Our data suggest that the interaction between APLP2 and ataxin-7 and proteolytic processing of APLP2 may contribute to the pathogenesis of SCA7.

20734314|t|Characterizing amyloid-beta protein misfolding from molecular dynamics simulations with explicit water.
20734314|a|Extracellular deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein, a fragment of membrane glycoprotein called beta-amyloid precursor transmembrane protein (betaAPP), is the major characteristic for the Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the structural and mechanistic information of forming Abeta protein aggregates in a lag phase in cell exterior has been still limited. Here, we have performed multiple all-atom molecular dynamics simulations for physiological 42-residue amyloid-beta protein (Abeta42) in explicit water to characterize most plausible aggregation-prone structure (APS) for the monomer and the very early conformational transitions for Abeta42 protein misfolding process in a lag phase. Monitoring the early sequential conformational transitions of Abeta42 misfolding in water, the APS for Abeta42 monomer is characterized by the observed correlation between the nonlocal backbone H-bond formation and the hydrophobic side-chain exposure. Characteristics on the nature of the APS of Abeta42 allow us to provide new insight into the higher aggregation propensity of Abeta42 over Abeta40, which is in agreement with the experiments. On the basis of the structural features of APS, we propose a plausible aggregation mechanism from APS of Abeta42 to form fibril. The structural and mechanistic observations based on these simulations agree with the recent NMR experiments and provide the driving force and structural origin for the Abeta42 aggregation process to cause AD.

20740476|t|Protective effects of dibenzocyclooctadiene lignans from Schisandra chinensis against beta-amyloid and homocysteine neurotoxicity in PC12 cells.
20740476|a|Aggregated beta-amyloid (Abeta) and elevated plasma levels of homocysteine have been implicated as critical factors in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The neuroprotective effects and possible mechanism of four structurally similar dibenzocyclooctadiene lignans (namely schisandrin, schisantherin A, schisandrin B and schisandrin C) isolated from the fruit of Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill. (Schisandraceae) against Abeta25-35 and homocysteine toxicity in PC12 cells was studied. Exposure of PC12 cells to 0.5 microm Abeta25-35 caused significant cell death, increased the number of apoptotic cells, elevated reactive oxygen species, increased the levels of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax and caspase-3 activation. All these effects induced by Abeta25-35 were markedly reversed by schisandrin B and schisandrin C pretreatment, while schisandrin and schisantherin A had no obvious effects. Meanwhile, schisandrin B and schisandrin C reversed homocysteine-induced cytotoxicity. The results indicated that schisandrin B and schisandrin C protected PC12 cells against Abeta toxicity by attenuating ROS production and modulating the apoptotic signal pathway through Bax and caspase-3. Further structure-activity analysis of Schisandra lignans and evaluations of their neuroprotective effects using AD animal models are warranted.

20804789|t|Age and gene overexpression interact to abolish nesting behavior in Tg2576 amyloid precursor protein (APP) mice.
20804789|a|Elucidating the modulators of social behavioral is important in understanding the neural basis of behavior and in developing methods to enhance behavior in cases of disorder. The work here stems from the observation that the Alzheimer's disease mouse model Tg2576, overexpressing human mutations of the amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP), fails to construct nests when supplied paper towels in their home cages. Experiments using commercially available cotton nesting material found similar results. Additional experiments revealed that the genotype effect is progressively modulated by age in APP mice but not their WT counterparts. There was no effect of sex on nesting behavior in any group. Finally, this effect was independent of ambient temperature - even when subjected to a cold environment, APP mice fail to build nests whereas WT mice do. These results suggest that the APP gene plays a role in affiliative behaviors and are discussed in relation to disorders characteristic of mutations in the APP gene and in affective dysfunction, including Alzheimer's disease.

20809197|t|The role of aromatic side-chains in amyloid growth and membrane interaction of the islet amyloid polypeptide fragment LANFLVH.
20809197|a|Human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) is known to misfold and aggregate into amyloid deposits that may be found in pancreatic tissues of patients affected by type 2 diabetes. Recent studies have shown that the highly amyloidogenic peptide LANFLVH, corresponding the N-terminal 12-18 region of IAPP, does not induce membrane damage. Here we assess the role played by the aromatic residue Phe in driving both amyloid formation and membrane interaction of LANFLVH. To this aim, a set of variant heptapeptides in which the aromatic residue Phe has been substituted with a Leu and Ala is studied. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and membrane-leakage experiments demonstrated that Phe substitution noticeably affects the peptide-induced changes in the thermotropic properties of the lipid bilayer but not its membrane damaging potential. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), ThT fluorescence and Congo red birefringence assays evidenced that the Phe residue is not required for fibrillogenesis, but it can influence the self-assembling kinetics. Molecular dynamics simulations have paralleled the outcome of the experimental trials also providing informative details about the structure of the different peptide assemblies. These results support a general theory suggesting that aromatic residues, although capable of affecting the self-assembly kinetics of small peptides and peptide-membrane interactions, are not essential either for amyloid formation or membrane leakage, and indicate that other factors such as beta-sheet propensity, size and hydrophobicity of the side chain act synergistically to determine peptide properties.

20821260|t|IGF-1 reduces BACE-1 expression in PC12 cells via activation of PI3-K/Akt and MAPK/ERK1/2 signaling pathways.
20821260|a|Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) stimulates alpha-secretase processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and decreases Abeta production. Little is known about the relationship between IGF-1 and beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1), the protease essential for the production of beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta). Here, we investigated the effect of IGF-1 on BACE-1 in PC12 cells. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis and western blot showed that treatment of cells with IGF-1 significantly decreased the levels of BACE-1 mRNA and protein. Furthermore, IGF-1 increased the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2. The presence of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) inhibitor LY294002 and the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MEK) inhibitor PD98059 blocked the effect of IGF-1 on BACE-1.

20828718|t|Biochemical studies in Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH) patients: change in CSF levels of amyloid precursor protein (APP), amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide and phospho-tau.
20828718|a|Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH) is one of the causes of dementia of the elderly characterized by impaired mental function, gait difficulties and urinary incontinence. Previously, it was proposed that some of the NPH patients may develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) like pathology. Aim of this study was to compare levels of different CSF biomarkers, including total secreted beta-amyloid precursor protein (sAPP), sAPP-alpha form (sAPPalpha), amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide, total-tau protein and hyperphosphorylated-tau protein in subjects from NPH and Non-NPH Control (NNC). CSF was collected from 23 NPH patients and 13 Non-NPH controls by lumber puncture. Western blot analysis was performed to measure levels of sAPP-total. ELISA was used separately to determine levels of sAPPalpha, Abeta peptide, total-tau and phospho-tau proteins. We found a significant decrease in levels of total secreted APP, sAPPalpha and Abeta (1-42) in the CSF sample of NPH patients vs. NNC. We did not observe any change in levels of total-tau or phospho-tau in NPH vs. NNC subjects. Notably, phospho-tau level was significantly increased in the NPH patients, who were suffering from the disease for more than one year, vs. NNC. Among five biomarkers studied, decreased sAPP, sAPPalpha and Abeta (1-42) levels in CSF can be molecular markers to distinguish NPH cases from NNC. Disease severity can also be assessed by increased levels of CSF phospho-tau protein and the ratio of phospho-tau to Abeta (1-42), which might be a useful tool for predicting conversion of NPH individuals to other neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD).

20842634|t|His-tag binding by antibody C706 mimics beta-amyloid recognition.
20842634|a|Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by extracellular deposits of beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques. Aggregation of the Abeta(42) peptide leading to plaque formation is believed to play a central role in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Anti-Abeta monoclonal antibodies can reduce amyloid plaques and could possibly be used for immunotherapy. We have developed a monoclonal antibody C706, which recognizes the human Abeta peptide. Here we report the crystal structure of the antibody Fab fragment at 1.7 A resolution. The structure was determined in two crystal forms, P2(1) and C2. Although the Fab was crystallized in the presence of Abeta(16), no peptide was observed in the crystals. The antigen-binding site is blocked by the hexahistidine tag of another Fab molecule in both crystal forms. The poly-His peptide in an extended conformation occupies a crevice between the light and heavy chains of the variable domain. Two consecutive histidines (His4-His5) stack against tryptophan residues in the central pocket of the antigen-binding surface. In addition, they form hydrogen bonds to the acidic residues at the bottom of the pocket. The mode of his-tag binding by C706 resembles the Abeta recognition by antibodies PFA1 and WO2. All three antibodies recognize the same immunodominant B-cell epitope of Abeta. By similarity, residues Phe-Arg-His of Abeta would be a major portion of the C706 epitope.

20844871|t|In vivo changes in microglial activation and amyloid deposits in brain regions with hypometabolism in Alzheimer's disease.
20844871|a|PURPOSE: Amyloid beta protein (Abeta) is known as a pathological substance in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is assumed to coexist with a degree of activated microglia in the brain. However, it remains unclear whether these two events occur in parallel with characteristic hypometabolism in AD in vivo. The purpose of the present study was to clarify the in vivo relationship between Abeta accumulation and neuroinflammation in those specific brain regions in early AD. METHODS: Eleven nootropic drug-naive AD patients underwent a series of positron emission tomography (PET) measurements with [(11)C](R)PK11195, [(11)C]PIB and [(18)F]FDG and a battery of cognitive tests within the same day. The binding potentials (BPs) of [(11)C](R)PK11195 were directly compared with those of [(11)C]PIB in the brain regions with reduced glucose metabolism. RESULTS: BPs of [(11)C](R)PK11195 and [(11)C]PIB were significantly higher in the parietotemporal regions of AD patients than in ten healthy controls. In AD patients, there was a negative correlation between dementia score and [(11)C](R)PK11195 BPs, but not [(11)C]PIB, in the limbic, precuneus and prefrontal regions. Direct comparisons showed a significant negative correlation between [(11)C](R)PK11195 and [(11)C]PIB BPs in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) (p < 0.05, corrected) that manifested the most severe reduction in [(18)F]FDG uptake. CONCLUSION: A lack of coupling between microglial activation and amyloid deposits may indicate that Abeta accumulation shown by [(11)C]PIB is not always the primary cause of microglial activation, but rather the negative correlation present in the PCC suggests that microglia can show higher activation during the production of Abeta in early AD.

20851099|t|Apolipoprotein E LDL receptor-binding domain-containing high-density lipoprotein: a nanovehicle to transport curcumin, an antioxidant and anti-amyloid bioflavonoid.
20851099|a|Curcumin is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory bioflavonoid that has been recently identified as an anti-amyloid agent as well. To make it more available in its potent form as a potential amyloid disaggregation agent, we employed high-density lipoproteins (HDL), which are lipid-protein complexes that transport plasma cholesterol, to transport curcumin. The objective of this study was to employ reconstituted HDL containing human apoE3 N-terminal (NT) domain, as a vehicle to transport curcumin. The NT domain serves as a ligand to mediate binding and uptake of lipoprotein complexes via the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) family of proteins located at the cell surface. Reconstituted HDL was prepared with phospholipids and recombinant apoE3-NT domain in the absence or presence of curcumin. Non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that the molecular mass and Stokes' diameter of HDL bearing curcumin were ~670kDa and ~17nm, respectively, while electron microscopy revealed the presence of discoidal particles. Fluorescence emission spectra of HDL bearing (the intrinsically fluorescent) curcumin indicated that the wavelength of maximal fluorescence emission (lambda(max)) of curcumin was ~495nm, which is highly blue-shifted compared to lambda(max) of curcumin in solvents of varying polarity (lambda(max) ranging from 515-575nm) or in aqueous buffers. In addition, an enormous enhancement in fluorescence emission intensity was noted in curcumin-containing HDL compared to curcumin in aqueous buffers. Curcumin fluorescence emission was quenched to a significant extent by lipid-based quenchers but not by aqueous quenchers. These observations indicate that curcumin has partitioned efficiently into the hydrophobic milieu of the phospholipid bilayer of HDL. Functional assays indicated that the LDLr-binding ability of curcumin-containing HDL with apoE3-NT is similar to that of HDL without curcumin. Taken together, we report that apoE-containing HDL has a tremendous potential as a 'nanovehicle' with a homing device to transport curcumin to target sites.

20852062|t|Novel synthetic small-molecule activators of AMPK as enhancers of autophagy and amyloid-beta peptide degradation.
20852062|a|AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a metabolic sensor involved in intracellular energy metabolism through the control of several homeostatic mechanisms, which include autophagy and protein degradation. Recently, we reported that AMPK activation by resveratrol promotes autophagy-dependent degradation of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides, the core components of the cerebral senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease. To identify more potent enhancers of Abeta degradation, we screened a library of synthetic small molecules selected for their structural similarities with resveratrol. Here, we report the identification of a series of structurally related molecules, the RSVA series, which inhibited Abeta accumulation in cell lines nearly 40 times more potently than did resveratrol. Two of these molecules, RSVA314 and RSVA405, were further characterized and were found to facilitate CaMKKbeta-dependent activation of AMPK, to inhibit mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), and to promote autophagy to increase Abeta degradation by the lysosomal system (apparent EC(50) ~ 1 muM). This work identifies the RSVA compounds as promising lead molecules for the development of a new class of AMPK activating drugs controlling mTOR signaling, autophagy, and Abeta clearance.

20853129|t|Transformation of amyloid beta(1-40) oligomers into fibrils is characterized by a major change in secondary structure.
20853129|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder occurring in the elderly. It is widely accepted that the amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) aggregation and especially the oligomeric states rather than fibrils are involved in AD onset. We used infrared spectroscopy to provide structural information on the entire aggregation pathway of Abeta(1-40), starting from monomeric Abeta to the end of the process, fibrils. Our structural study suggests that conversion of oligomers into fibrils results from a transition from antiparallel to parallel beta-sheet. These structural changes are described in terms of H-bonding rupture/formation, beta-strands reorientation and beta-sheet elongation. As antiparallel beta-sheet structure is also observed for other amyloidogenic proteins forming oligomers, reorganization of the beta-sheet implicating a reorientation of beta-strands could be a generic mechanism determining the kinetics of protein misfolding. Elucidation of the process driving aggregation, including structural transitions, could be essential in a search for therapies inhibiting aggregation or disrupting aggregates.

20859697|a|INTRODUCTION: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapies with antibodies and small molecular EGFR kinase inhibitors have shown poor efficacy in unselected populations of patients with advanced non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC). In contrast, patients with overexpression of EGFR and activating mutations in EGFR kinase domain demonstrated improved responses to EGFR kinase inhibitors. Therefore, we have developed a novel radiotracer, [(18)F]F-PEG(6)-IPQA for PET imaging of EGFR expression-activity in NSCLC, and have described its radiosynthesis and in vitro evaluation in two NSCLC cell lines with wild-type and L858R active mutant EGFR. METHODS: A mesylate precursor was synthesized in multiple steps and radiofluorinated using K(18)F/Kryptofix. The fluorinated intermediate compound was reduced to an amino derivative then treated with acryloyl isobutyl carbonate, followed by purification by HPLC to obtain the desired product. RESULTS: Decay-corrected radiochemical yields of [(18)F]F-PEG(6)-IPQA were 3.9-17.6%, with an average of 9.0% (n = 11). Radiochemical purity was >97% with specific activity of 34 GBq/mumol (mean value, n = 10) at the end of synthesis. The accumulation of [(18)F]F-PEG(6)-IPQA in H3255 cells was ten-fold higher than in H441 cells, despite a two-fold lower level of activated phospho-EGFR expression in H3255 cells compared with H441 cells. The accumulation of [(18)F]F-PEG(6)-IPQA in both cell lines was significantly decreased in the presence of a small molecular EGFR kinase inhibitor, Iressa, at 100 muM concentration in culture medium. CONCLUSION: We have synthesized [(18)F]F-PEG(6)-IPQA and demonstrated its highly selective accumulation in active mutant L858R EGFR-expressing NSCLC cells in vitro. Further in vivo studies are warranted to assess the ability of PET imaging with [(18)F]F-PEG(6)-IPQA to discriminate the active mutant L858R EGFR-expressing NSCLC that are sensitive to therapy with EGFR kinase inhibitors vs NSCLC that express wild-type EGFR.

20872872|t|CD measurements of beta-amyloid (1-40) and (1-42) in the condensed phase.
20872872|a|Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy of proteins/peptides in thin films can provide valuable information on the structures in the aggregated states; however, it is difficult to estimate the secondary structure content quantitatively due to artifact signals arising from macroscopic anisotropies which is unique to the solid phase. Using a Universal Chiroptical Spectrophotometer (UCS-1) together with the measurement and analytical procedures we have developed, we could obtain artifact-free CD spectra of cast and Langmuir-Blodgett (L-B) films of synthetic peptides, Abeta (1-40) and (1-42) which are related to Alzheimer's disease. The work gave insights into the mechanisms for structural transformation and amyloid-like aggregation.

20880294|t|Changes in CSF acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase activity after long-term treatment with AChE inhibitors in Alzheimer's disease.
20880294|a|OBJECTIVES:   To measure cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) participating in randomized clinical trials from three European centers, before and after long-term treatment with different AChE inhibitors (AChEIs). MATERIALS AND METHODS:   Of the 144 patients included in the study, 104 were treated with donepezil, 15 with galantamine, 16 with rivastigmine, and nine with placebo. CSF AChE and BChE activities were measured at baseline and after 1- year treatment. RESULTS: Donepezil and galantamine groups showed a significant increase in CSF AChE activity at follow-up, while no changes for BChE activity were observed; in donepezil group, a positive correlation between plasma concentration and AChE activity was documented. Conversely, in rivastigmine group, a decrease in CSF activity of both enzymes was observed. CSF AChE and BChE activities were not correlated with the clinical outcome in any group considered. CSF biomarkers did not show any change after treatment. CONCLUSIONS:   AChEIs differently influence the activity of target enzymes in CSF independent of their pharmacodynamic effects.

20890809|a|A new resveratrol oligomer (1) together with eight related components (2- 9) were isolated from the seed extract of Paeonia lactiflora (Paeoniaceae) as active principles responsible for the inhibition of beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1) in vitro. The chemical structure of 1 was established as (-)-7a,8a- CIS- epsilon-viniferin with the aid of spectroscopic analyses including NOESY experiments. All isolated resveratrol oligomers (1- 9) demonstrated significant inhibition on baculovirus-expressed BACE-1 in a dose-dependent manner, which was assessed by the FRET assay using Rh-EVNLDAEFK as a substrate in vitro.

20920466|t|Effect of trehalose on the interaction of Alzheimer's Abeta-peptide and anionic lipid monolayers.
20920466|a|The interaction of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) with cell membranes is believed to play a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. In particular, recent experimental evidence indicates that bilayer and monolayer membranes accelerate the aggregation and amyloid fibril formation rate of Abeta. Understanding that interaction could help develop therapeutic strategies for treatment of the disease. Trehalose, a disaccharide of glucose, has been shown to be effective in preventing the aggregation of numerous proteins. It has also been shown to delay the onset of certain amyloid-related diseases in a mouse model. Using Langmuir monolayers and molecular simulations of the corresponding system, we study several thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of the insertion of Abeta peptide into DPPG monolayers in water and trehalose subphases. In the water subphase, the insertion of the Abeta peptide into the monolayer exhibits a lag time which decreases with increasing temperature of the subphase. In the presence of trehalose, the lag time is completely eliminated and peptide insertion is completed within a shorter time period compared to that observed in pure water. Molecular simulations show that more peptide is inserted into the monolayer in the water subphase, and that such insertion is deeper. The peptide at the monolayer interface orients itself parallel to the monolayer, while it inserts with an angle of 50  in the trehalose subphase. Simulations also show that trehalose reduces the conformational change that the peptide undergoes when it inserts into the monolayer. This observation helps explain the experimentally observed elimination of the lag time by trehalose and the temperature dependence of the lag time in the water subphase.

20921877|t|Nonfibrillar Abeta 1-42 inhibits glutamate uptake and phosphorylates p38 in human fibroblasts.
20921877|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, characterized by an increased deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) within the central nervous system, leading to neuronal death. The availability of effective models, in which confirming novel pathogenic hypotheses and developing therapeutic targets, represents a very important goal for the field of AD. Fibroblasts from these patients may be relevant models in which addressing these issues, as they display biochemical alterations mirroring SNC ones. In this work, fibroblasts obtained from controls were studied after exposure to nonfibrillar Abeta 1-42, showing decreased glutamate uptake, similar to that observed in AD cells, in absence of transporters modifications. Nonfibrillar Abeta 1-42 was able to induce in control cells mitochondrial alterations and p38-phosphorylation, mirroring similar alterations found in AD fibroblasts. Under our experimental conditions, this treatment induced neither apoptosis nor necrosis. To investigate a putative role of p38-modulation in mediating nonfibrillar Abeta 1-42 toxicity, fibroblasts from controls were pretreated with retinoic-acid, and SB203580, a p38-inhibitor. These pretreatments prevented both p38-phosphorylation and glutamate uptake inhibition. Our results suggest that nonfibrillar Abeta 1-42 downregulates glutamate transporters activity interfering with p38-activation and mitochondrial stress. Thus, modulating complex kinase signaling pathway might represent a future therapeutic target in AD.

20930275|t|Accumulation of insoluble amyloid-beta in down's syndrome is associated with increased BACE-1 and neprilysin activities.
20930275|a|We previously reported age- and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related increases in the activities of beta-secretase (BACE-1) and Abeta-degrading enzymes including neprilysin (NEP) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the frontal cortex. We suggested that these increases were secondary to the accumulation of insoluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) and a decline in soluble Abeta. We have further tested this hypothesis by examination of frontal cortex obtained postmortem from individuals with Down's syndrome (DS), in whom AD-like neuropathological changes occur in association with early-onset dementia. We measured total soluble and insoluble (guanidine-extractable) Abeta, BACE-1 activity, and the concentrations and activities of NEP and ACE in two independent DS cohorts: an initial, Bristol cohort (9 DS cases, 8 controls matched for age-at-death) and a validation Newcastle cohort (20 DS, 18 controls with a wider spectrum of age-at-death). In both cohorts the level of insoluble (but not soluble) Abeta was significantly higher in DS than controls and was comparable to previously measured levels in AD. NEP protein concentration and activity were significantly increased in DS; a trend towards increased BACE-1 activity was observed in DS but did not reach statistical significance. Both NEP and BACE-1 correlated with the level of insoluble Abeta. The concentration of ACE in DS was elevated in the pilot cohort only and ACE activity was unchanged. These findings provide strong support that BACE-1 and NEP activities, but not ACE, increase in response to the accumulation of insoluble Abeta within the brain.

20930280|t|Ghrelin ameliorates cognitive dysfunction and neurodegeneration in intrahippocampal amyloid-beta1-42 oligomer-injected mice.
20930280|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive deficits, neuroinflammation, and loss of neurons. Recently, it has been shown that ghrelin, a 28 amino acid peptide hormone produced from the stomach and hypothalamus, has been reported as a potential therapeutic agent for several neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), stroke, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and spinal cord injury. Here we determined the effects of ghrelin on memory impairments and neuropathological changes in an AD mouse model induced by intrahippocampal injection of amyloid-beta oligomers (AbetaO). We report that ghrelin: 1) rescues memory deficits in mice injected with AbetaO in the hippocampus; 2) decreases AbetaO-induced microgliosis in hippocampus; 3) attenuates hippocampal neuronal loss mediated by AbetaO; 4) prevents AbetaO-associated synaptic degeneration including cholinergic fiber loss. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that ghrelin can ameliorate AbetaO-induced cognitive impairment associated with neuroinflammation and neuronal loss. These results suggest that ghrelin may be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of AD.

20930295|t|Ultrafiltrate of blood plasma modulates amyloid-beta aggregation.
20930295|a|Several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), have etiology connected to abnormal protein self association. Copper-induced striking differences in amyloid-beta40 aggregation, distinct from spontaneous self association, prompted us to study whether amyloid-beta40 aggregation could be applied to differentiate between platelet poor plasma ultrafiltrates obtained from AD and control samples. We report, based on 20 AD and 18 age-matched controls, a significant difference in the concentration of short fibers induced by ultrafiltrated plasma from AD compared to control samples. The observed effect was independent of copper and other EDTA chelatable ions.

20930307|t|Enhanced expression of the voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) in Alzheimer's disease transgenic mice: an insight into the pathogenic effects of amyloid-beta.
20930307|a|The mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) is involved in the release of apoptotic proteins with possible relevance in Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology. Through proteomic analysis followed by Western blotting and immunohistochemical techniques, we have found that VDAC1 is overexpressed in the hippocampus from amyloidogenic AD transgenic mice models. VDAC1 was also overexpressed in postmortem brain tissue from AD patients at an advanced stage of the disease. Interestingly, amyloid-beta (Abeta) soluble oligomers were able to induce upregulation of VDAC1 in a human neuroblastoma cell line, further supporting a correlation between Abeta levels and VDAC1 expression. In hippocampal extracts from transgenic mice, a significant increase was observed in the levels of VDAC1 phosphorylated at an epitope that is susceptible to phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase-3beta, whose activity was also increased. The levels of hexokinase I (HXKI), which interacts with VDAC1 and affects its function, were decreased in mitochondrial samples from AD models. Since phospho-VDAC and reduced HXKI levels favors a VDAC1 conformational state more prone to the release proapoptotic factors, regulation of the function of this channel may be a promising therapeutic approach to combat AD.

20934487|t|Increased expression of miRNA-146a in Alzheimer's disease transgenic mouse models.
20934487|a|A mouse and human brain-enriched micro-RNA-146a (miRNA-146a) is known to be important in modulating the innate immune response and inflammatory signaling in certain immunological and brain cell types. In this study we examined miRNA-146a levels in early-, moderate- and late-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) neocortex and hippocampus, in several human primary brain and retinal cell lines, and in 5 different transgenic mouse models of AD including Tg2576, TgCRND8, PSAPP, 3xTg-AD and 5xFAD. Inducible expression of miRNA-146a was found to be significantly up-regulated in a primary co-culture of human neuronal-glial (HNG) cells stressed using interleukin1-beta (IL-1beta), and this up-regulation was quenched using specific NF-kB inhibitors including curcumin. Expression of miRNA-146a correlated with senile plaque density and synaptic pathology in Tg2576 and in 5xFAD transgenic mouse models used in the study of this common neurodegenerative disorder.

20935134|t|Performance of finishing beef steers in response to anabolic implant and zilpaterol hydrochloride supplementation.
20935134|a|Our objectives were to evaluate the dose/payout pattern of trenbolone acetate (TBA) and estradiol-17beta (E(2)) implants and feeding of zilpaterol hydrochloride (ZH) on performance and carcass characteristics of finishing beef steers. A randomized complete block design was used with a 3 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. British x Continental steers (n = 168; initial BW = 362 kg) were blocked by BW and allotted randomly to 42 pens (7 pens/treatment; 6 pens/block; 4 steers/pen). The main effects of treatment were implant [no implant (NI); Revalor-S (REV-S; 120 mg of TBA + 24 mg of E(2)); and Revalor-XS (REV-X; 200 mg of TBA + 40 mg of E(2))] and ZH (0 or 8.3 mg/kg of DM for 20 d with a 3-d withdrawal before slaughter). Blocks were split into 2 groups, and block groups were fed for either 153 or 174 d. No implant x ZH interactions were noted for cumulative performance data. Overall, shrunk final BW (567, 606, and 624 kg for NI, REV-S, and REV-X, respectively), ADG (1.25, 1.51, and 1.60 kg), and G:F (0.14, 0.16, and 0.17) increased (P < 0.05) as TBA and E(2) dose increased. Implanting increased (P < 0.05) DMI, but DMI did not differ (P > 0.10) between REV-S and REV-X (8.8 for NI vs. 9.4 kg/d for the 2 implants). From d 1 to 112 of the feeding period, implanting increased (P < 0.05) ADG and G:F, but REV-S and REV-X did not differ (P > 0.10). From d 112 to end, ADG increased by 19% (P < 0.05) and G:F was 18% greater (P < 0.05) for REV-X vs. REV-S. Carcass-adjusted final BW (29-kg difference), ADG (0.2-kg/d difference), and G:F (0.02 difference) were increased (P < 0.05) by ZH, but daily DMI was not affected by feeding ZH. Hot carcass weight was increased (P < 0.05) by ZH (19-kg difference) and implant, with REV-X resulting in the greatest response (HCW of 376 for NI vs. 404 and 419 kg for REV-S and REV-X, respectively; P < 0.05). An implant x ZH interaction (P = 0.05) occurred for dressing percent (DP). Without ZH, implanting increased DP, but DP did not differ (P > 0.10) between REV-X and REV-S. With ZH, REV-X increased (1.7%; P < 0.05) DP vs. NI and REV-S. Marbling score, 12th-rib fat, and KPH were not affected (P > 0.10) by implant or ZH. Overall, treatment increased steer performance and HCW in an additive fashion, suggesting different mechanisms of action for ZH and steroidal implants. In addition, a greater dose of TBA + E(2) and extended payout improved steer performance and HCW.

20936504|t|Amyloid-beta decreases nitric oxide production in cultured retinal neurons: a possible mechanism for synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease?
20936504|a|The neurotoxicity of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) appears to be, at least in part, related to pathological activation of glutamate receptors by Abeta aggregates. However, the downstream signaling pathways leading to neurodegeneration are still incompletely understood. Hyperactivation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and increased nitric oxide (NO) production have been implicated in excitotoxic neuronal damage caused by overactivation of glutamate receptors, and it has been suggested that increased NO levels might also play a role in neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease. We have examined the effect of blockade of NO production on the neurotoxicity instigated by Abeta42 and by elevated concentrations of glutamate in chick embryo retinal neurons in culture. Results showed that L-nitroarginine methyl ester, a potent inhibitor of all NOS isoforms, had no protective effect against neuronal death induced by either Abeta42 (20 muM) or glutamate (1 mM). Surprisingly, at short incubation times both Abeta and glutamate decreased NO production in retinal neuronal cultures in the absence of neuronal death. Thus, excitotoxic insults induced by Abeta and glutamate cause inhibition rather than activation of NO synthase in retinal neurons, suggesting that cell death induced by Abeta or glutamate is not related to increased NO production. On the other hand, considering the role of NO in long term potentiation and synaptic plasticity, the decrease in NO levels instigated by Abeta and glutamate suggests a possible mechanism leading to synaptic failure in AD.

20937383|t|Cholinotrophic basal forebrain system alterations in 3xTg-AD transgenic mice.
20937383|a|The cholinotrophic system, which is dependent upon nerve growth factor and its receptors for survival, is selectively vulnerable in Alzheimer's disease (AD). But, virtually nothing is known about how this deficit develops in relation to the hallmark lesions of this disease, amyloid plaques and tau containing neurofibrillary tangles. The vast majority of transgenic models of AD used to evaluate the effect of beta amyloid (Abeta) deposition upon the cholinotrophic system over-express the amyloid precursor protein (APP). However, nothing is known about how this system is affected in triple transgenic (3xTg)-AD mice, an AD animal model displaying Abeta plaque- and tangle-like pathology in the cortex and hippocampus, which receive extensive cholinergic innervation. We performed a detailed morphological and biochemical characterization of the cholinotrophic system in young (2-4 months), middle-aged (13-15 months) and old (18-20 months) 3xTg-AD mice. Cholinergic neuritic swellings increased in number and size with age, and were more conspicuous in the hippocampal-subicular complex in aged female than in 3xTg-AD male mice. Stereological analysis revealed a reduction in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) positive cells in the medial septum/vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca in aged 3xTg-AD mice. ChAT enzyme activity levels decreased significantly in the hippocampus of middle-aged 3xTg-AD mice compared to age-matched non-transgenic (or wild type) mice. ProNGF protein levels increased in the cortex of aged 3xTg-AD mice, whereas TrkA protein levels were reduced in a gender-dependent manner in aged mutant mice. In contrast, p75(NTR) protein cortical levels were stable but increased in the hippocampus of aged 3xTg-AD mice. These data demonstrate that cholinotrophic alterations in 3xTg-AD mice are age- and gender-dependent and more pronounced in the hippocampus, a structure more severely affected by Abeta plaque pathology.

20938166|t|Effects of estrogen on beta-amyloid-induced cholinergic cell death in the nucleus basalis magnocellularis.
20938166|a|Alzheimer disease is characterized by accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) and cognitive dysfunctions linked to early loss of cholinergic neurons. As estrogen-based hormone replacement therapy has beneficial effects on cognition of demented patients, and it may prevent memory impairments, we investigated the effect of estrogen-pretreatment on Abeta-induced cholinergic neurodegeneration in the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM). We tested which Abeta species induces the more pronounced cholinotoxic effect in vivo. We injected different Abeta assemblies in the NBM of mice, and measured cholinergic cell and cortical fiber loss. Spherical Abeta oligomers had the most toxic effect. Pretreatment of ovariectomized mice with estrogen before Abeta injection decreased cholinergic neuron loss and partly prevented fiber degeneration. By using proteomics, we searched for proteins involved in estrogen-mediated protection and in Abeta toxicity 24 h following injection. The change in expression of, e.g., DJ-1, NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase, ATP synthase, phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 1, protein phosphatase 2A and dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1 support our hypothesis that Abeta induces mitochondrial dysfunction, decreases MAPK signaling, and increases NOS activation in NBM. On the other hand, altered expression of, e.g., MAP kinase kinase 1 and 2, protein phosphatase 1 and 2A by Abeta might increase MAPK suppression and NOS signaling in the cortical target area. Estrogen pretreatment reversed most of the changes in the proteome in both areas. Our experiments suggest that regulation of the MAPK pathway, mitochondrial pH and NO production may all contribute to Abeta toxicity, and their regulation can be prevented partly by estrogen pretreatment.

20941644|t|Intranasal phosphoramidon increases beta-amyloid levels in wild-type and NEP/NEP2-deficient mice.
20941644|a|Intranasal administration is emerging as a reliable and non-invasive method to bypass the blood-brain barrier and deliver drugs to the brain. This approach has been primarily used to explore therapeutic avenues for neurological diseases. However, intranasal administration could also be used to create animal models of brain disease. Beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) accumulation is a key feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the most common models of AD are transgenic mice expressing mutant human genes linked to familial AD. An alternative model of amyloidosis utilizes intracerebroventricular infusion of thiorphan or phosphoramidon to block the activity of key Abeta degrading enzymes (NEP, NEP2) resulting in accumulation of Abeta. Here, we demonstrate that intranasal administration of phosphoramidon produces significantly elevated cerebral Abeta levels in wild-type mice. Furthermore, intranasal phosphoramidon administration in double knockout mice lacking NEP and NEP2 also showed increased levels of Abeta(40). These data show that intranasal delivery of drugs can be used to model AD and suggest that other phosphoramidon-sensitive peptidases are degrading Abeta in NEP/NEP2-deficient mice.

20941707|t|Asymmetric amyloid fibril elongation: a new perspective on a symmetric world.
20941707|a|Amyloids are insoluble, fibrous proteins formed through the aggregation of misfolded proteins. They accumulate in the tissue of individuals with degenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. The purpose of this study was to determine whether fibril growth from an initial model fibril seed is unidirectional or bidirectional. The prevailing theory on amyloid formation is that a symmetric fibril elongates equally from both ends. This study provides evidence to the contrary; the process occurs predominately unidirectionally, demonstrating that amyloid fibrils may be asymmetric and propagate mostly in one direction. Alexa Fluor 568 labeled insulin fibrils were seeded into a native insulin solution and allowed to elongate at 65 C while the kinetics of fibril growth was monitored. The resulting elongated fibrils were labeled with thioflavin-T, and the fluorescent images of the fibrils show that a majority of the elongated fibrils propagated along only one end of the seed, with the remaining labeled fibrils having bidirectional elongation or no elongation. Using a crystallographic model, we offer a structural explanation for asymmetric growth of the insulin fibrils. Thus, instead of the current view that fibrils grow symmetrically from both ends of the fibril, this is the first evidence that insulin amyloid fibrils formed in solution are asymmetric and appear to grow from only one end.

20944553|t|Cognitive and cortical plasticity deficits correlate with altered amyloid-beta CSF levels in multiple sclerosis.
20944553|a|Cognitive dysfunction is of frequent observation in multiple sclerosis (MS). It is associated with gray matter pathology, brain atrophy, and altered connectivity, and recent evidence showed that acute inflammation can exacerbate mental deficits independently of the primary functional system involved. In this study, we measured cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of amyloid-beta(1-42) and tau protein in MS and in clinically isolated syndrome patients, as both proteins have been associated with cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD, amyloid-beta(1-42) accumulates in the brain as insoluble extracellular plaques, possibly explaining why soluble amyloid-beta(1-42) is reduced in the CSF of these patients. In our sample of MS patients, amyloid-beta(1-42) levels were significantly lower in patients cognitively impaired (CI) and were inversely correlated with the number of Gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesions at the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Positive correlations between amyloid-beta(1-42) levels and measures of attention and concentration were also found. Furthermore, abnormal neuroplasticity of the cerebral cortex, explored with theta burst stimulation (TBS), was observed in CI patients, and a positive correlation was found between amyloid-beta(1-42) CSF contents and the magnitude of long-term potentiation-like effects induced by TBS. No correlation was conversely found between tau protein concentrations and MRI findings, cognitive parameters, and TBS effects in these patients. Together, our results indicate that in MS, central inflammation is able to alter amyloid-beta metabolism by reducing its concentration in the CSF and leading to impairment of synaptic plasticity and cognitive function.

20945972|t|Protective effects of clioquinol on human neuronal-like cells: a new formulation of clioquinol-loaded PLGA microspheres for Alzheimer's disease.
20945972|a|BACKGROUND: Clioquinol (CQ), a metal chelator, has gained renewed attention due to its ability to modulate metal homeostasis in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. PURPOSE: To investigate the protective effects of a wide range of concentrations of CQ on two human neuroblastoma cell lines (IMR-32 and SKN-AS) and to develop and characterize a new controlled release system of CQ consisting of biodegradable microspheres. RESULTS: H(2)O(2) (400 muM) adequately induced death cell in IMR-32 and SKN-AS cell lines thereby resulting in a useful model for neuroprotective studies. CQ (20-50 muM) induced a potent and robust protective effect against peroxide-mediated oxidative stress in human neuronal-like cells (SKN-AS) determined by both MTT and flow cytometry (cell viability). These results were also confirmed by means of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Biodegradable poly(dl-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) resomers assayed for microspheres preparation were PLGA-502 and PLGA-502H. Optimization by using an experimental design resulted in a formulation prepared with CQ (112 mg) and PLGA-502H (400 mg). With this formulation, mean encapsulation efficiency of 82.37% +- 6.67% and, zero-order release rate of 58 +- 3microg CQ/day/10 mg microspheres between Days 10 and 35 were obtained. CONCLUSION: We have developed a promising formulation for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

20951207|t|Striatal Abeta peptide deposition mirrors dementia and differentiates DLB and PDD from other parkinsonian syndromes.
20951207|a|Recent neuropathological studies have described widespread amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) deposition in the striatum of patients with Lewy body disorders, particularly in Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). However, positron emission tomography (PET) studies using the [(11)C]PIB ligand, binding to Abeta deposits, detects significant striatal pathology only in DLB and not in PDD. Employing immunohistochemistry, we examined striatal Abeta deposition in the caudate nucleus and putamen of 52 PD, 41 PDD, 14 DLB, 7 multiple system atrophy (MSA) and 14 progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) cases in relation to the presence of dementia. PD, MSA and PSP cases showed little or no Abeta pathology in the striatum. In contrast, both PDD and DLB cases demonstrated significantly greater Abeta deposition in the striatum when compared to PD, MSA and PSP groups. We conclude that striatal Abeta pathology is common in both PDD and DLB and may reflect the development of dementia in these conditions. More detailed examination of the morphology of the Abeta pathology suggests that it is the presence of cored amyloid plaques in DLB, but not PDD, that underlies the differences seen in PET imaging.

20954203|t|Differences in cytotoxicity of beta-sheet peptides originated from silk and amyloid beta.
20954203|a|The relationships between amino acid sequence, nano-assemblies, and cytotoxicity to neuron cytotoxicity were investigated using beta-sheet-forming peptides from Araneus ventricosus spider silk, and amyloid forming peptides Abeta(12-28) (beta1), Abeta(28-42) (beta2), and full-length Abeta(1-42). Although silk derived peptides formed nano-assemblies, nanofilaments, and nanofibrils with beta-sheet contents raging from 24 to 40%, they showed no significant cytotoxicity to neurons. In contrast, nano-assemblies and nanofibrils formed from Abeta peptides with high beta-sheet content demonstrated cytotoxicity to the neurons. These differences in cell response between the silk beta-sheets and Abeta peptides indicate that the general propensity to form beta sheets and form nanostructures is not sufficient to predict cytotoxicity, while surface charges of the assemblies are significant factors that impact cytotoxicity.

Electrically, stimulus train-elicited plastic changes in hippocampal CA1 excitability were used as an experimental paradigm to study the effects of curcuminoid mixture and individual components on functional failure induced by Abeta peptide in vitro. Electrical stimulation was applied on Schaffer collaterals, and population spikes (PS) were recorded from stratum pyramidale. To induce long-term potentiation (LTP) of PS, primed burst stimulation (PBs) was used. Abeta peptide inhibited PS LTP induction. Sinking PS LTP due to Abeta peptide was rescued when curcuminoid mixture was applied before PBs only at lower dose (0.1 muM) resulting in PS potentiation to 127.42% +- 1.83% at 5 min and 123.98% +- 1.06% at 60-min post-PBs. Similarly, when bisdemethoxycurcumin was applied, PS LTP was induced and lasted only at a single dose (0.1 muM). Demethoxycurcumin was effective at a middle dose (1 muM), so that the PS amplitude was changed to 140.15% +- 2.68% and 129.82% +- 0.44% at 5 and 60 min, respectively. PS LTP was effectively induced in the presence of curcumin at middle and high doses (1 and 30 muM) with resultant PS LTP to 155.68% +- 1.23% and 127.72% +- 1.23%, respectively, at 60-min post-PBs. These results showed that curcuminoids can restore susceptibility for plastic changes in CA1 excitability that is injured by exposure to Abeta peptide and rescue sinking PS LTP in Abeta-peptide-exposed hippocampal CA1 neurons.

20965254|t|beta-Amyloid affects frontal and posterior brain networks in normal aging.
20965254|a|Although deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta), a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), has also been reported in cognitively intact older people, its influence on brain structure and cognition during normal aging remains controversial. Using PET imaging with the radiotracer Pittsburgh compound B (PIB), structural MRI, and cognitive measures, we examined the relationships between Abeta deposition, gray matter volume, and cognition in older people without AD. Fifty-two healthy older participants underwent PIB-PET and structural MRI scanning and detailed neuropsychological tests. Results from the whole-brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis revealed that gray matter volume in the left inferior frontal cortex was negatively associated with amyloid deposition across all participants whereas reduced gray matter volume was shown in the posterior cingulate among older people with high amyloid deposition. When gray matter density measures extracted from these two regions were related to other brain regions by applying a structural covariance analysis, distinctive frontal and posterior brain networks were seen. Gray matter volume in these networks in relation to cognition, however, differed such that reduced frontal network gray matter volume was associated with poorer working memory performance while no relationship was found for the posterior network. The present findings highlight structural and cognitive changes in association with the level of Abeta deposition in cognitively intact normal elderly and suggest a differential role of Abeta-dependent gray matter loss in the frontal and posterior networks in cognition during normal aging.

20966549|t|Passive (amyloid-beta) immunotherapy attenuates monoaminergic axonal degeneration in the AbetaPPswe/PS1dE9 mice.
20966549|a|The role of amyloid-beta (Abeta in the neurodegeneration of Alzheimer's disease remains controversial, to a large extent because of the lack of robust neurodegeneration in mouse models of AD. To address this question, we examined the effects of Abeta antibodies in the recently described monoaminergic (MAergic) axonal degeneration in AbetaPPswe/PS1dE9 mice. To determine if Abeta accumulation is directly involved in degeneration of MAergic axons, we examined the effects of passive anti-Abeta antibody (7B6) administration on Abeta pathology and MAergic degeneration in AbetaPPswe/PS1dE9 mice. Injections of monoclonal antibody (mAb) 7B6 into mice (6 to 9 months of age) resulted in a modest reduction of Abeta load in the brains of AbetaPPswe/PS1dE9 mice. In addition, 7B6 treated AbetaPPswe/PS1dE9 mice had significantly higher densities of MAergic axons in both cortex and in hippocampus as compared to untreated mutant mice. For example, 7B6 treated mice showed almost 2-fold greater densities of serotonergic (5-HT) axons in the cortex compared to saline treated mice. Similar findings were observed in the catecholaminergic (TH) axons. Our results demonstrate that lowering of Abeta levels via passive Abeta immunotherapy ameliorates ongoing degenerative processes, supporting a causal link between Abeta and neurodegeneration.

20966550|t|A novel perspective for Alzheimer's disease: vitamin D receptor suppression by amyloid-beta and preventing the amyloid-beta induced alterations by vitamin D in cortical neurons.
20966550|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) is the core component of amyloid plaques of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The effects of Abeta include damage to neuronal plasma membrane, disruption of Ca(2+) homeostasis, and alterations of neurotrophic factor levels. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of Abeta treatment on vitamin D receptor (VDR), L-type voltage sensitive calcium channels A1C (LVSCC A1C), NGF, and observing the effects of vitamin D treatment on Abeta induced alterations in primary cortical neurons. As to the latter, we aimed to test the suggested neuroprotective role of vitamin D as a neglected neurosteroid. The expressions of VDR and LVSCC A1C were studied with qRT-PCR and Western blotting. NGF and cytotoxicity levels were determined by ELISA. Apoptotic cell death was investigated with caspase-3 protein expression by Western blotting. Our results showed that the Abeta triggers neurodegeneration not only by inducing LVSCC A1C expression and NGF levels and but also by dramatically suppressing VDR expression. Administration of vitamin D to this model protected neurons by preventing cytotoxicity and apoptosis, and also by downregulating LVSCC A1C and upregulating VDR. Additionally, vitamin D brought NGF expression to a state of equilibrium and did not show its apoptosis inducing effects. Consequently, prevention of Abeta toxicity which was one of the major component of AD type pathology by vitamin D treatment and understanding how Abeta effects vitamin D related pathways, might open up new frontiers in clarifying molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration and provide basis for novel perspectives in both preventing and treating AD.

20969847|t|TEMPOL protects human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells against beta-amyloid-induced cell toxicity.
20969847|a|Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It can cause cell death in Alzheimer's disease by evoking a cascade of oxidative damage to neurons. Antioxidant compounds may help to elucidate and develop a treatment for Alzheimer's disease. In the present study, we investigated the protective effect of TEMPOL (4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy), a cyclic nitroxide which is particularly effective at reducing oxidative injury, on Abeta(1-42)-induced SH-SY5Y cell toxicity. Exposure of cells to 20 muM Abeta(1-42) for 48 h caused viability loss and apoptotic increase, and pre-treatment with TEMPOL for 24 h significantly reduced the viability loss and apoptotic rate. In addition, TEMPOL inhibited Abeta(1-42)-induced superoxide anion generation and hydroxyl radical generation to a striking degree. Based on these results, it is concluded that TEMPOL effectively protects SH-SY5Y cells against beta-amyloid-induced damage by suppressing the generation of reactive oxygen species especially, superoxide anion.

20971854|t|Amyloid-beta protein oligomer at low nanomolar concentrations activates microglia and induces microglial neurotoxicity.
20971854|a|Neuroinflammation and associated neuronal dysfunction mediated by activated microglia play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD). Microglia are activated by aggregated forms of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta), usually demonstrated in vitro by stimulating microglia with micromolar concentrations of fibrillar Abeta, a major component of amyloid plaques in AD brains. Here we report that amyloid-beta oligomer (AbetaO), at 5-50 nm, induces a unique pattern of microglia activation that requires the activity of the scavenger receptor A and the Ca(2+)-activated potassium channel KCa3.1. AbetaO treatment induced an activated morphological and biochemical profile of microglia, including activation of p38 MAPK and nuclear factor kappaB. Interestingly, although increasing nitric oxide (NO) production, AbetaO did not increase several proinflammatory mediators commonly induced by lipopolyliposaccharides or fibrillar Abeta, suggesting that AbetaO stimulates both common and divergent pathways of microglia activation. AbetaO at low nanomolar concentrations, although not neurotoxic, induced indirect, microglia-mediated damage to neurons in dissociated cultures and in organotypic hippocampal slices. The indirect neurotoxicity was prevented by (i) doxycycline, an inhibitor of microglia activation; (ii) TRAM-34, a selective KCa3.1 blocker; and (iii) two inhibitors of inducible NO synthase, indicating that KCa3.1 activity and excessive NO release are required for AbetaO-induced microglial neurotoxicity. Our results suggest that AbetaO, generally considered a neurotoxin, may more potently cause neuronal damage indirectly by activating microglia in AD.

20971855|t|Structural insight into the differential effects of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids on the production of Abeta peptides and amyloid plaques.
20971855|a|Several studies have shown the protective effects of dietary enrichment of various lipids in several late-onset animal models of Alzheimer Disease (AD); however, none of the studies has determined which structure within a lipid determines its detrimental or beneficial effects on AD. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) shows that saturated fatty acids (SFAs), upstream omega-3 FAs, and arachidonic acid (AA) resulted in significantly higher secretion of both Abeta 40 and 42 peptides compared with long chain downstream omega-3 and monounsaturated FAs (MUFA). Their distinct detrimental action is believed to be due to a structural template found in their fatty acyl chains that lack SFAs, upstream omega-3 FAs, and AA. Immunoblotting experiments and use of APP-C99-transfected COS-7 cells suggest that FA-driven altered production of Abeta is mediated through gamma-secretase cleavage of APP. An early-onset AD transgenic mouse model expressing the double-mutant form of human amyloid precursor protein (APP); Swedish (K670N/M671L) and Indiana (V717F), corroborated in vitro findings by showing lower levels of Abeta and amyloid plaques in the brain, when they were fed a low fat diet enriched in DHA. Our work contributes to the clarification of aspects of structure-activity relationships.

20978902|t|APP involvement in retinogenesis of mice.
20978902|a|Very few studies have examined expression and function of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the retina. We showed that APP mRNA and protein are expressed according to the different waves of retinal differentiation. Depletion of App led to an absence of amacrine cells, a 50% increase in the number of horizontal cells and alteration of the synapses. The retinas of adult APP(-/-) mice showed only half as many glycinergic amacrine cells as wild-type retinas. We identified Ptf1a, which plays a role in controlling both amacrine and horizontal cell fates, as a downstream effector of APP. The observation of a similar phenotype in sorLA knockout mice, a major regulator of APP processing, suggests that regulation of APP functions via sorLA controls the determination of amacrine and horizontal cell fate. These findings provide novel insights that indicate that APP plays an important role in retinal differentiation.

21029727|t|Subcellular compartmentalization of proteolytic enzymes in brain regions and the effects of chronic beta-amyloid treatment.
21029727|a|Amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) is the major amyloid component of toxic amyloid senile plaques inducing slow neuronal degeneration in brains of Alzheimer's patients. It can induce proteolysis of some cytoskeletal proteins in the neuron; however, studies of proteolytic enzyme activity in different brain regions and their subcellular compartmentalization were not carried out. In this work, the effects of chronic intracerebroventricular administration of Abeta(25-35) on proteolytic enzymes in subcellular fractions from rat brain regions were studied. Mitochondrial and cytosolic caspase-9 and caspase-3 activities in neocortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus were shown to be increased during infusion of Abeta(25-35). In Abeta(25-35)-treated rats, cytosolic calcium-dependent thiol proteases calpain-1 and calpain-2 appeared in mitochondria and lysosomes, causing apparent release of lysosomal cathepsins B and D to mitochondria and of beta-galactosidase to the cytosol. The increase in all proteolytic activities in brain subcellular fractions under the influence of administered Abeta suggests that these enzymes could be transferred across intracellular membranes and involved in neurodegeneration.

21034809|t|beta-Amyloid peptide increases levels of iron content and oxidative stress in human cell and Caenorhabditis elegans models of Alzheimer disease.
21034809|a|Recent studies indicate that the deposition of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) is related to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD); however, the underlying mechanism is still not clear. The abnormal interactions of Abeta with metal ions such as iron are implicated in the process of Abeta deposition and oxidative stress in AD brains. In this study, we observed that Abeta increased the levels of iron content and oxidative stress in SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing the Swedish mutant form of human beta-amyloid precursor protein (APPsw) and in Caenorhabditis elegans Abeta-expressing strain CL2006. Intracellular iron and calcium levels and reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide generation significantly increased in APPsw cells compared to control cells. The activity of superoxide dismutase and the antioxidant levels of APPsw cells were significantly lower than those of control cells. Moreover, iron treatment decreased cell viability and mitochondrial membrane potential and aggravated oxidative stress damage as well as the release of Abeta1-40 from the APPsw cells. The iron homeostasis disruption in APPsw cells is very probably associated with elevated expression of the iron transporter divalent metal transporter 1, but not transferrin receptor. Furthermore, the C. elegans with Abeta-expression had increased iron accumulation. In aggregate, these results demonstrate that Abeta accumulation in neuronal cells correlated with neuronal iron homeostasis disruption and probably contributed to the pathogenesis of AD.

21035554|t|Volumetric MRI and MRS provide sensitive measures of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology in inducible Tau transgenic mice (rTg4510).
21035554|a|The purpose of this study was to determine if in vivo high resolution 3D MRI and localized (1)H MR spectroscopy (MRS) can detect brain findings resembling Alzheimer's disease in a transgenic mouse model of Tau pathology. Seven double transgenic rTg4510 female mice and 7 age-matched wild-type (wt) female mice were evaluated at 5 months of age. To confirm the usefulness and consistency of in vivo MRI/S, we also scanned the brains of 14 male mice (7 rTg4510 and 7 age-matched wt) at 8 months of age. Mean hippocampal and cerebral cortex volumes in the female rTg4510 mice were 26.7% and 20.6% smaller than that in the wt controls (p<0.0001), respectively. Mean hippocampal and cerebral cortex volumes in the male rTg4510 mice were 18.4% and 16.9% smaller than that in the wt controls (p<0.00005), respectively. The mean volumes of the cerebellum were not statistically different between the rTg4510 and the wt groups. MRS assessment revealed that the myo-inositol to total creatine ratios (mIns/tCr), a measure of gliosis, were significantly higher in the hippocampus of rTg4510 mice relative to wt mice (p=0.03 for the females; p=0.005 for the males). Immunohistochemistry and histology in the same animals verified previously published data showing elevation of hyperphosphorylated Tau, glial activation and cortical and hippocampal neuronal loss. This study demonstrates that in vivo MRI/S can be a non-invasive biomarker to assess brain atrophy and related biochemical changes in the rTg4510 mouse model.

21036142|t|Liposome-incorporated DHA increases neuronal survival by enhancing non-amyloidogenic APP processing.
21036142|a|The fluidity of neuronal membranes plays a pivotal role in brain aging and neurodegeneration. In this study, we investigated the role of the omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in modulation of membrane fluidity, APP processing, and protection from cytotoxic stress. To this end, we applied unilamellar transfer liposomes, which provided protection from oxidation and effective incorporation of DHA into cell membranes. Liposomes transferring docosanoic acid (DA), the completely saturated form of DHA, to the cell cultures served as controls. In HEK-APP cells, DHA significantly increased membrane fluidity and non-amyloidogenic processing of APP, leading to enhanced secretion of sAPPalpha. This enhanced secretion of sAPPalpha was associated with substantial protection against apoptosis induced by ER Ca(2+) store depletion. sAPPalpha-containing supernatants obtained from HEK-APP cells exerted similar protective effects as DHA in neuronal PC12 cells and HEK293 control cells. Correlating to further increased sAPPalpha levels, supernatants obtained from DHA-treated HEK-APP cells enhanced protection, whereas supernatants obtained from DHA-treated HEK293 control cells did not inhibit apoptosis, likely due to the low expression of endogenous APP and negligible sAPPalpha secretion in these cells. Further experiments with the small molecule inhibitors LY294002 and SP600125 indicated that sAPPalpha-induced cytoprotection relied on activation of the anti-apoptotic PI3K/Akt pathway and inhibition of the stress-triggered JNK signaling pathway in PC12 cells. Our data suggest that liposomal DHA is able to restore or maintain physiological membrane properties, which are required for neuroprotective sAPPalpha secretion and autocrine modulation of neuronal survival.

21040071|t|Oleic acid ameliorates amyloidosis in cellular and mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.
21040071|a|Several lines of evidence support protective as well as deleterious effects of oleic acid (OA) on Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurological disorders; however, the bases of these effects are unclear. Our investigation demonstrates that amyloid precursor protein (APP) 695 transfected Cos-7 cells supplemented with OA have reduced secreted amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels. An early-onset AD transgenic mouse model expressing the double-mutant form of human APP, Swedish (K670N/M671L) and Indiana (V717F), corroborated our in vitro findings when they were fed a high-protein, low-fat (18% reduction), cholesterol-free diet enriched with OA. These mice exhibited an increase in Abeta40/Abeta42 ratio, reduced levels of beta-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE) and reduced presenilin levels along with reduced amyloid plaques in the brain. The decrease in BACE levels was accompanied by increased levels of a non-amyloidogenic soluble form of APP (sAPPalpha). Furthermore, the low-fat/+OA diet resulted in an augmentation of insulin-degrading enzyme and insulin-like growth factor-II. These results suggest that OA supplementation and cholesterol intake restriction in a mouse model of AD reduce AD-type neuropathology.

21044078|t|alpha-secretase in Alzheimer's disease: molecular identity, regulation and therapeutic potential.
21044078|a|Ectodomain shedding of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the metalloprotease activity alpha-secretase is a key regulatory event preventing the generation of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) amyloid beta peptide. Proteases similar to alpha-secretase are essential for diverse physiological processes, such as embryonic development, cell adhesion and neuronal guidance. Previously, several proteases were suggested as candidate alpha-secretases for APP, in particular members of the ADAM family (a disintegrin and metalloprotease). Two recent studies analyzed primary neurons, which are the cell type affected in AD, and finally demonstrated that the constitutively cleaving alpha-secretase activity is selectively mediated by ADAM10. An increase in alpha-secretase cleavage is considered a therapeutic approach for AD. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating alpha-secretase cleavage remain only partly understood. Signaling pathways activating protein kinase C and MAP kinase play a central role in stimulating alpha-secretase cleavage of APP. Additionally, several recent publications demonstrate that ADAM10 expression and alpha-secretase cleavage of APP are tightly controlled at the level of transcription, e.g. by retinoic acid receptors and sirtuins, and at the level of translation and protein trafficking. This review focuses on the recent progress made in unraveling the molecular identity, regulation and therapeutic potential of alpha-secretase in Alzheimer's disease.

21044080|t|Restraint stress increases neuroinflammation independently of amyloid beta levels in amyloid precursor protein/PS1 transgenic mice.
21044080|a|Both hypercortisolemia and hippocampal damage are features found in patients diagnosed of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and epidemiological evidence supports a role for stress as a risk factor for AD. It is known that immobilization stress is followed by accumulation of oxidative/nitrosative mediators in brain after the release of proinflammatory cytokines, nuclear factor kappa B activation, nitric oxide synthase-2 and cyclooxygenase-2 expression. Long-term exposure to elevated corticosteroid levels is known to affect the hippocampus which plays a central role in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. We therefore studied the effect of chronic immobilization stress on amyloid precursor protein/PS1 mice. Stress exposure increased AD-induced neuroinflammation characterized by astrogliosis, increased inflammatory gene transcription and lipid peroxidation. Importantly, immobilization stress did not increase the soluble or insoluble amyloid beta levels suggesting that increased cortisol levels lower the threshold for a neuroinflammatory response, independently from amyloid beta. Since inflammation may act as a factor that contributes disease progression, the stress-inflammation relation described here may be relevant to understand the initial mechanisms in underlying the risk enhancing action of stress on AD.

21047784|t|Membrane cholesterol modulates {beta}-amyloid-dependent tau cleavage by inducing changes in the membrane content and localization of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors.
21047784|a|We have previously shown that beta-amyloid (Abeta) treatment resulted in an age-dependent calpain activation leading to Tau cleavage into a neurotoxic 17-kDa fragment in a cellular model of Alzheimer disease. This detrimental cellular response was mediated by a developmentally regulated increase in membrane cholesterol levels. In this study, we assessed the molecular mechanisms by which cholesterol modulated Abeta-induced Tau cleavage in cultured hippocampal neurons. Our results indicated that these mechanisms did not involve the regulation of the binding of Abeta aggregates to the plasma membrane. On the other hand, experiments using N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor inhibitors suggested that these receptors played an essential role in cholesterol-mediated Abeta-dependent calpain activity and 17-kDa Tau production. Biochemical and immunocytochemical analyses demonstrated that decreasing membrane cholesterol levels in mature neurons resulted in a significant reduction of the NR1 subunit at the membrane as well as an increase in the number of large NR1, NR2A, and NR2B subunit clusters. Moreover, the majority of these larger N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor subunit immunoreactive spots was not juxtaposed to presynaptic sites in cholesterol-reduced neurons. These data suggested that changes at the synaptic level underlie the mechanism by which membrane cholesterol modulates developmental changes in the susceptibility of hippocampal neurons to Abeta-induced toxicity.

21047883|t|CSF amyloid beta38 as a novel diagnostic marker for dementia with Lewy bodies.
21047883|a|BACKGROUND: The clinical distinction between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is sometimes difficult, particularly in mild cases. Although CSF markers such as amyloid beta42 (Abeta42) and P-tau can distinguish between AD and normal controls, their ability to distinguish between AD and DLB is not adequate. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate whether CSF markers, in particular levels of Abeta38, can differentiate between mild AD and DLB. METHODS: 85 individuals were included after standardised diagnostic procedures: 30 diagnosed as probable AD, 23 probable DLB, 20 probable Parkinson's disease dementia and 12 non-demented control subjects. CSF levels of Abeta38, Abeta40 and Abeta42 were determined using commercially available ultra-sensitive multi-array kit assay (MSD) for human Abeta peptides. Total tau (T-tau) and phosphorylated tau (P-tau) were analysed using ELISA (Innotest). In addition, combinations (Abeta42/Abeta38, Abeta42/Abeta40, Abeta42/P-tau and Abeta42/Abeta38/P-tau) were assessed. RESULTS: Significant between group differences were found for all CSF measures, and all except Abeta40, Abeta42 and Abeta42/P-tau differed between AD and DLB. The Abeta42/Abeta38 ratio was the measure that best discriminated between AD and DLB (AUC 0.765; p<0.005), with a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 67%. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the level of Abeta38 can potentially contribute in the diagnostic distinction between AD and DLB when combined with Abeta42. Single measures had low diagnostic accuracy, suggesting that developing a panel of markers is the most promising strategy. Studies with independent and larger samples and a priori cut-offs are needed to test this hypothesis.

21053258|t|Study of the interaction between the amyloid beta peptide (1-40) and antioxidant compounds by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
21053258|a|Amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) aggregation leads to the senile plaque formation, a process that is strongly influenced by oxidative stress and is considered as the molecular basis of various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Endogenous antioxidants or dietary derived compounds may down-regulate this process. In this study, the interaction of two antioxidants, oleuropein (OE) and melatonin (M), with Abeta is monitored through nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The concerted application of these two analytical techniques provides new experimental evidence and residue-specific insights into the interacting Abeta peptide amino acids that are implicated in this process. Both antioxidant compounds interact in a similar way with the peptide and cause chemical shift variations. The most pronounced resonance changes have been observed for the 1H-15N signals of N-terminal region and Leu17-Phe20 residues, as monitored by NMR titration studies.

21054384|t|Induction of Alzheimer's-like changes in brain of mice expressing mutant APP fed excess methionine.
21054384|a|Elevated plasma homocysteine, a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, could result from increased production from methionine or by inefficient clearance by folate- and B-vitamin-dependent pathways. Understanding the relative contributions of these processes to pathogenesis is important for therapeutic strategies designed to lower homocysteine. To assess these alternatives, we elevated plasma homocysteine by feeding mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP)-expressing mice diets with either high methionine (HM) or deficient in B-vitamins and folate (B Def). Mutant APP mice fed HM demonstrated increased brain beta amyloid. Interestingly, this increase was not observed in mutant APP mice fed B Def diet, nor was it observed in C57Bl6 or YAC-APP mice fed HM. Furthermore, HM, but not B Def, produced a prolonged increase in brain homocysteine only in mutant APP mice but not wild-type mice. These changes were time-dependent over 10 weeks. Further, by 10 weeks HM increased brain cholesterol and phosphorylated tau in mutant APP mice. Transcriptional profiling experiments revealed robust differences in RNA expression between C57Bl6 and mutant APP mice. The HM diet in C57Bl6 mice transiently induced a transcriptional profile similar to mutant APP cortex, peaking at 2 weeks , following a time course comparable to brain homocysteine changes. Together, these data suggest a link between APP and methionine metabolism.

21055450|t|The n-terminal 5-MER peptide analogue P165 of amyloid precursor protein exerts protective effects on SH-SY5Y cells and rat hippocampus neuronal synapses.
21055450|a|The disturbance of the insulin-signaling pathway plays an important role in Alzheimer's disease. Resistance to insulin signaling renders neurons energy-deficient and vulnerable to oxidization or other metabolic insults and impairs synaptic plasticity. In search of neuroprotective drugs, we synthesized a peptide analogue, P165, an active domain of the soluble amyloid precursor protein, which is resistant to degradation and is suitable for oral administration in a clinical setting. Initially, we confirmed that P165 can protect cells from streptozotocin-caused damage and stimulate cell outgrowth using cultured SH-SY5Y cell lines treated with streptozotocin. P165 significantly reduced lactate dehydrogenase leakage from damaged cells, thereby rescuing cell energy production. Insulin signaling such as insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) proteins were upregulated to stimulate cell survival and growth. We proceeded to investigate the effect of P165 on streptozotocin-treated Alzheimer's disease (AD) rats. The data showed that P165 protected synaptic loss and dysfunction by increasing synaptophysin and PSD-95 (post synaptic density-95), while simultaneously decreasing alpha-synuclein expression. Moreover, animal behavior testing clearly showed that P165 increased rats' learning and memory activity. Overall, these results constitute evidence that peptide analogue 165 may protect synapse and improve learning and memory ability in AD.

21055469|t|Sedimentation velocity analysis of amyloid oligomers and fibrils using fluorescence detection.
21055469|a|The assembly of proteins into large fibrillar aggregates, known as amyloid fibrils, is associated with a number of common and debilitating diseases. In some cases, proteins deposit extracellularly, while in others the aggregation is intracellular. A common feature of these diseases is the presence of aggregates of different sizes, including mature fibrils, small oligomeric precursors, and other less well understood structural forms such as amorphous aggregates. These various species possess distinct biochemical, biophysical, and pathological properties. Here, we detail a number of techniques that can be employed to examine amyloid fibrils and oligomers using a fluorescence-detection system (FDS) coupled with the analytical ultracentrifuge. Sedimentation velocity analysis using fluorescence detection is a particularly useful method for resolving the complex heterogeneity present in amyloid systems and can be used to characterize aggregation in exceptional detail. Furthermore, the fluorescence detection module provides a number of particularly attractive features for the analysis of aggregating proteins. It expands the practical range of concentrations of aggregating proteins under study, which is useful for greater insight into the aggregation process. It also enables the assessment of aggregation behavior in complex biological solutions, such as cell lysates, and the assessment of processes that regulate in-cell or extracellular aggregation kinetics. Four methods of fluorescent detection that are compatible with the current generation of FDS instrumentation are described: (1) Detection of soluble amyloid fibrils using a covalently bound fluorophore. (2) Detection of amyloid fibrils using an extrinsic dye that emits fluorescence when bound to fibrils. (3) Detection of fluorescently-labeled lipids and their interaction with oligomeric amyloid intermediates. (4) Detection of green fluorescence protein (GFP) constructs and their interactions within mammalian cell lysates.

21056616|t|Presenilin mouse and zebrafish models for dementia: focus on neurogenesis.
21056616|a|Autosomal dominant mutations in the presenilin gene PSEN cause familial Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurological disorder pathologically characterized by intraneuronal accumulation and extracellular deposition of amyloid-beta in plaques and intraneuronal, hyperphosphorylated tau aggregation in neurofibrillary tangles. Presenilins (PS/PSENs) are part of the proteolytic gamma-secretase complex, which cleaves substrate proteins within the membrane. Cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by gamma-secretase releases amyloid-beta peptides. Besides its role in the processing of APP and other transmembrane proteins, presenilin plays an important role in neural progenitor cell maintenance and neurogenesis. In this review, we discuss the role of presenilin in relation to neurogenesis and neurodegeneration and review the currently available presenilin animal models. In addition to established mouse models, zebrafish are emerging as an attractive vertebrate model organism to study the role of presenilin during the development of the nervous system and in neurodegenerative disorders involving presenilin. Zebrafish is a suitable model organism for large-scale drug screening, making this a valuable model to identify novel therapeutic targets for AD.

21059358|t|Amyloid fibril recognition with the conformational B10 antibody fragment depends on electrostatic interactions.
21059358|a|Amyloid fibrils are naturally occurring polypeptide scaffolds with considerable importance for human health and disease. These supermolecular assemblies are beta-sheet rich and characterized by a high structural order. Clinical diagnosis and emerging therapeutic strategies of amyloid-dependent diseases, such as Alzheimer's, rely on the specific recognition of amyloid structures by other molecules. Recently, we generated the B10 antibody fragment, which selectively binds to Alzheimer's Abeta(1-40) amyloid fibrils but does not explicitly recognize other protein conformers, such as oligomers and disaggregated Abeta peptide. B10 presents poly-amyloid specific binding and interacts with fibrillar structures consisting of different polypeptide chains. To determine the molecular basis behind its specificity, we have analyzed the molecular properties of B10 with a battery of biochemical and biophysical techniques, ranging from X-ray crystallography to chemical modification studies. We find that fibril recognition depends on positively charged residues within the B10 antigen binding site. Mutation of these basic residues into alanine potently impairs fibril binding, and reduced B10-fibril interactions are also observed when the fibril carboxyl groups are covalently masked by a chemical modification approach. These data imply that the B10 conformational specificity for amyloid fibrils depends upon specific electrostatic interactions with an acidic moiety, which is common to different amyloid fibrils.

21059748|t|Beta-secretase inhibitor GRL-8234 rescues age-related cognitive decline in APP transgenic mice.
21059748|a|Alzheimer disease is intimately linked to an excess amount of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the brain. Thus, therapeutic inhibition of Abeta production is an attractive clinical approach to treat this disease. Here we provide the first direct experimental evidence that the treatment of Tg2576 transgenic mice with an inhibitor of beta-secretase, GRL-8234, rescues the age-related cognitive decline. We demonstrated that the injected GRL-8234 effectively enters the brain and rapidly decreases soluble Abeta in the brain of Tg2576 mice. The rescue of cognition, which was observed only after long-term inhibitor treatment ranging from 5 to 7.5 mo, was associated with a decrease of brain amyloid-beta plaque load. We also found no accumulation of amyloid-beta precursor protein after several months of inhibitor treatment. These observations substantiate the idea that Abeta accumulation plays a major role in the cognitive decline of Tg2576 mice and support the concept of Abeta reduction therapy as a treatment of AD.

21060949|t|Probing aromatic, hydrophobic, and steric effects on the self-assembly of an amyloid-beta fragment peptide.
21060949|a|Aromatic amino acids have been shown to promote self-assembly of amyloid peptides, although the basis for this amyloid-inducing behavior is not understood. We adopted the amyloid-beta 16-22 peptide (Abeta(16-22), Ac-KLVFFAE-NH(2)) as a model to study the role of aromatic amino acids in peptide self-assembly. Abeta(16-22) contains two consecutive Phe residues (19 and 20) in which Phe 19 side chains form interstrand contacts in fibrils while Phe 20 side chains interact with the side chain of Va l18. The kinetic and thermodynamic effect of varying the hydrophobicity and aromaticity at positions 19 and 20 by mutation with Ala, Tyr, cyclohexylalanine (Cha), and pentafluorophenylalanine (F(5)-Phe) (order of hydrophobicity is Ala < Tyr < Phe < F(5)-Phe < Cha) was characterized. Ala and Tyr position 19 variants failed to undergo fibril formation at the peptide concentrations studied, but Cha and F(5)-Phe variants self-assembled at dramatically enhanced rates relative to wild-type. Cha mutation was thermodynamically stabilizing at position 20 (DeltaDeltaG = -0.2 kcal mol(-1) relative to wild-type) and destabilizing at position 19 (DeltaDeltaG = +0.2 kcal mol(-1)). Conversely, F(5)-Phe mutations were strongly stabilizing at both positions (DeltaDeltaG = -1.3 kcal mol(-1) at 19, DeltaDeltaG = -0.9 kcal mol(-1) at 20). The double Cha and F(5)-Phe mutants showed that the thermodynamic effects were additive (DeltaDeltaG = 0 kcal mol(-1) for Cha 19,20 and -2.1 kcal mol(-1) for F(5)-Phe 19,20). These results indicate that sequence hydrophobicity alone does not dictate amyloid potential, but that aromatic, hydrophobic, and steric considerations collectively influence fibril formation.

21061029|t|Zinc(II) modulates specifically amyloid formation and structure in model peptides.
21061029|a|Metal ions such as zinc and copper can have dramatic effects on the aggregation kinetics of and the structures formed by several amyloidogenic peptides/proteins. Depending on the identity of the amyloidogenic peptide/protein and the conditions, Zn(II) and Cu(II) can promote or inhibit fibril formation, and in some cases these metal ions have opposite effects. To better understand this modulation of peptide aggregation by metal ions, the impact of Zn(II) binding to three amyloidogenic peptides (Abeta14-23, Abeta11-23, and Abeta11-28) on the formation and structure of amyloid-type fibrils was investigated. Zn(II) was able to accelerate fibril formation for all three peptides as measured by thioflavin T fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy. The effects of Zn(II) on Abeta11-23 and Abeta11-28 aggregation were very different compared with the effects of Cu(II), showing that these promoting effects were metal-specific. X-ray absorption spectroscopy suggested that the Zn(II) binding to Abeta11-23 and Abeta11-28 is very different from Cu(II) binding, but that the binding is similar in the case of Abeta14-23. A model is proposed in which the different coordination chemistry of Zn(II) compared with Cu(II) explains the metal-specific effect on aggregation and the difference between peptides Abeta14-23 and Abeta11-23/Abeta11-28.

21062284|t|In vivo regulation of amyloid precursor protein neuronal splicing by microRNAs.
21062284|a|The beta-amyloid peptide that accumulate in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain derive from proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Recent evidence suggest that microRNAs (miRNAs) participate in the post-transcriptional regulation of APP expression. Because gene dosage effects of the APP gene can cause genetic AD, dysregulation of the miRNA network could contribute significantly to disease. Here, we present evidence that, besides APP expression regulation, miRNAs are equally involved in the regulation of neuronal APP mRNA alternative splicing. Lack of miRNAs in post-mitotic neurons in vivo is associated with APP exons 7 and 8 inclusion, while ectopic expression of miR-124, an abundant neuronal-specific miRNA, reversed these effects in cultured neurons. Similar results were obtained by depletion of endogenous polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1) in cells, a recognized miR-124 target gene. Furthermore, PTBP1 levels correlate with the presence of APP exons 7 and 8, while PTBP2 levels correlate with the skipping of these exons during neuronal differentiation. Finally, we show that miR-124 is down-regulated in AD brain. In sum, our results suggest that specific miRNAs are involved in the fine-tuning of APP alternative splicing in neurons. Since abnormal neuronal splicing of APP affects beta-amyloid peptide production, these results could contribute to the understanding of the implication of miRNAs in brain health and disease.

21063627|t|Tetracycline prevents Abeta oligomer toxicity through an atypical supramolecular interaction.
21063627|a|The antibiotic tetracycline was reported to possess an anti-amyloidogenic activity on a variety of amyloidogenic proteins both in in vitro and in vivo models. To unveil the mechanism of action of tetracycline on Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 at both molecular and supramolecular levels, we carried out a series of experiments using NMR spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, dynamic laser light-scattering (DLS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Firstly we showed that the co-incubation of Abeta1-42 oligomers with tetracycline hinders the toxicity towards N2a cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, the nature of the interaction between the drug and Abeta oligomers was investigated. To carry out NMR and FTIR studies we have prepared Abeta peptide solutions containing assemblies ranging from monomers to large oligomers. Saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR experiments have shown that tetracycline did not interact with monomers at variance with oligomers. Noteworthy, in this latter case we observed that this interaction was very peculiar since the transfer of magnetization from Abeta oligomers to tetracycline involved all drug protons. In addition, intermolecular cross-peaks between tetracycline and Abeta were not observed in NOESY spectra, indicating the absence of a specific binding site and suggesting the occurrence of a supramolecular interaction. DLS and AFM studies supported this hypothesis since the co-dissolution of Abeta peptides and tetracycline triggered the immediate formation of new aggregates that improved the solubility of Abeta peptides, preventing in this way the progression of the amyloid cascade. Moreover, competitive NMR binding experiments showed for the first time that tetracycline competes with thioflavin T (ThT) in the binding to Abeta peptides. Our data shed light on a novel mechanism of anti-amyloidogenic activity displayed by tetracycline, governed by hydrophobic and charge multiparticle interactions.

21069870|t|A differential association of Apolipoprotein E isoforms with the amyloid-beta oligomer in solution.
21069870|a|The molecular pathogenesis of disorders arising from protein misfolding and aggregation is difficult to elucidate, involving a complex ensemble of intermediates, whose toxicity depends upon their state of progression along distinct processing pathways. To address the complex misfolding and aggregation that initiates the toxic cascade resulting in Alzheimer's disease (AD), we have developed a 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl-4-amino-4-carboxylic acid spin-labeled amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide to observe its isoform-dependent interaction with the apoE protein. Although most individuals carry the E3 isoform of apoE, ~15% of humans carry the E4 isoform, which is recognized as the most significant genetic determinant for Alzheimer's. ApoE is consistently associated with the amyloid plaque marker for AD. A vital question centers on the influence of the two predominant isoforms, E3 and E4, on Abeta peptide processing and hence Abeta toxicity. We used electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy of incorporated spin labels to investigate the interaction of apoE with the toxic oligomeric species of Abeta in solution. EPR spectra of the spin-labeled side chain report on side chain and backbone dynamics as well as the spatial proximity of spins in an assembly. Our results indicate oligomer binding involves the C-terminal domain of apoE, with apoE3 reporting a much greater response through this conformational marker. Coupled with SPR binding measurements, apoE3 displays a higher affinity and capacity for the toxic Abeta oligomer. These findings support the hypothesis that apoE polymorphism and Alzheimer's risk can largely be attributed to the reduced ability of apoE4 to function as a clearance vehicle for the toxic form of Abeta.

21070848|t|NOS-mediated morphological and molecular modifications in rats infused with Abeta (1-40), as a model of Alzheimer's disease, in response to a new lipophilic molecular combination codrug-1.
21070848|a|Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative pathology due to the presence of beta-amyloid plaques at brain level and hippocampus level and associated with the loss of memory speech and learning. At the basis of these effects lie molecular mechanisms which include nitric oxide metabolic pathway, whose involvement in the occurrence of morphological modifications related to such neurodegenerative process is suggested. Current evidences show that the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen posses a protective effect against the development of the disease, substantially delaying its onset; furthermore (R)-alpha-lipoic acid seems to have an antioxidant ameliorating effect on disease progression. Starting from these data, a new lipophilic codrug 1, obtained by joining an antioxidant molecule with an NSAID, has been previously synthesized. Our aim has been to investigate the possible therapeutical effects of codrug 1, compared to ibuprofen, on the molecular events at the basis of behavioural and morphological modifications occurring in Abeta (1-40) infused rat brains. Ibuprofen and codrug 1 seem to protect the subject against memory performance impairment and against behavioural detriment, induced by administration of Abeta (1-40) peptide. Such evidences are supported by morphological and biochemical findings showing Abeta (1-40) to determine cell disorganization, increased number of beta-amyloid plaques and capillary vessels dilatation in parallel to increased total and specific NOS activity and to apoptosis occurrence, partly prevented by ibuprofen, more broadly by codrug 1. Such results underline the involvement of nitric oxide metabolic pathway in the events related to the onset of this pathology and suggest codrug 1 as a useful tool to protect the brain against cognitive and behavioural dysfunction, by reducing beta-amyloid plaques formation and by inhibiting NOS signalling pathway and apoptosis occurrence.

21071724|t|Induction of autoimmunity to brain antigens by developmental mercury exposure.
21071724|a|A.SW mice, which are known to be prone to mercury (Hg)-induced immune nephritis, were assessed for their ability to develop autoimmunity to brain antigens after developmental exposure to Hg. Maternal drinking water containing subclinical doses of 1.25muM methyl Hg (MeHg) or 50muM Hg chloride (HgCl(2)) were used to evaluate developmental (exposure from gestational day 8 to postnatal day 21) induction of immune responses to brain antigens. Only HgCl(2) induced autoantibody production; the HgCl(2)-exposed offspring showed an increased number of CD4(+) splenic T cells expressing CD25 and V(beta) 8.3 chains, and the brain-reactive immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were predominantly against nuclear proteins (30 and 34 kD). The antibodies were deposited in all brain regions. Although male and female A.SW mice exposed to HgCl(2) showed deposition of IgG in multiple brain regions, inflammation responses were observed only in the cerebellum (CB) of female A.SW mice; these responses were associated with increased levels of exploratory behavior. The developmental exposure to MeHg also induced inflammation in the CB and increased exploratory behavior of the female A.SW mice, but the change did not correlate with increased IgG in the brain. Interestingly, the non-Hg-exposed female A.SW mice habituated (adapted to the information and/or stimuli of a new environment) more than the male A.SW mice during exploratory behavior assessment, and the Hg exposure eliminated the habituation (i.e., no changes in behavior with subsequent trials), making the female behaviors more like those of the male A.SW mice. Additionally, gender differences in A.SW brain cytokine expressions prior to Hg exposure were eliminated by the Hg exposure.

21073551|t|beta-Secretase activity in rat astrocytes: translational block of BACE1 and modulation of BACE2 expression.
21073551|a|BACE1 and BACE2 are two closely related membrane-bound aspartic proteases. BACE1 is widely recognized as the neuronal beta-secretase that cleaves the amyloid-beta precursor protein, thus allowing the production of amyloid-beta, i.e. the peptide that has been proposed to trigger the neurodegenerative process in Alzheimer's disease. BACE2 has ubiquitous expression and its physiological and pathological role is still unclear. In light of a possible role of glial cells in the accumulation of amyloid-beta in brain, we have investigated the expression of these two enzymes in primary cultures of astrocytes. We show that astrocytes possess beta-secretase activity and produce amyloid-beta because of the activity of BACE2, but not BACE1, the expression of which is blocked at the translational level. Finally, our data demonstrate that changes in the astrocytic phenotype during neuroinflammation can produce both a negative as well as a positive modulation of beta-secretase activity, also depending on the differential responsivity of the brain regions.

21073877|t|Inhibiting beta-secretase activity in Alzheimer's disease cell models with single-chain antibodies specifically targeting APP.
21073877|a|The Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide is produced from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavage of APP first by beta-secretase and then by gamma-secretase. beta-Site APP cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1) is the predominant enzyme involved in beta-secretase processing of APP and is a primary therapeutic target for treatment of Alzheimer's disease. While inhibiting BACE-1 activity has obvious therapeutic advantages, BACE-1 also cleaves numerous other substrates with important physiological activity. Thus, blanket inhibition of BACE-1 function may have adverse side effects. We isolated a single chain variable fragment (scFv) from a human-based scFv yeast display library that selectively inhibits BACE-1 activity toward APP by binding the APP substrate at the proteolytic site. We selected the iBSEC1 scFv, since it recognizes the BACE-1 cleavage site on APP but does not bind the adjacent highly antigenic N-terminal of Abeta, and thus it will target APP but not soluble Abeta. When added to 7PA2 cells, a mammalian cell line that overexpresses APP, the iBSEC1 scFv binds APP on the cell surface, reduces toxicity induced by APP overexpression, and reduces both intracellular and extracellular Abeta levels by around 50%. Since the iBSEC1 scFv does not contain the antibody F(c) region, this construct does not pose the risk of exacerbating inflammation in the brain as faced with full-length monoclonal antibodies for potential therapeutic applications.

21073971|t|Ciproxifan, an H3 receptor antagonist, alleviates hyperactivity and cognitive deficits in the APP Tg2576 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
21073971|a|Previous research has indicated that the blockade of H(3)-type histamine receptors may improve attention and memory in normal rodents. The purpose of this study was to determine if ciproxifan, an H(3) receptor antagonist, could alleviate the hyperactivity and cognitive deficits observed in a transgenic mouse model (APP(Tg2576)) of Alzheimer's disease. APP(Tg2576) mice displayed significantly greater locomotor activity than wild-type mice, but APP(Tg2576) mice provided with daily ciproxifan treatment showed activity levels that did not differ from wild-type mice. In the swim maze, APP(Tg2576) mice exhibited significantly longer escape latencies, but the APP(Tg2576) mice treated daily with ciproxifan had latencies that were indistinguishable from controls. In probe trials conducted one hour after the last training trial, ciproxifan-treated APP(Tg2576) mice spent more time near the previous platform location and made more crossings of this area than did saline-treated APP(Tg2576) mice. APP(Tg2576) mice also demonstrated a significant impairment in the object recognition task that was reversed by acute treatment with ciproxifan (3.0mg/kg). These data support the idea that modulation of H(3) receptors represents a novel and viable therapeutic strategy in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

21074575|t|Inhibition of JNK phosphorylation reverses memory deficit induced by beta-amyloid (1-42) associated with decrease of apoptotic factors.
21074575|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia that is degenerative and terminal disease. The main reason of the disease is still unknown. beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques are the important hallmarks of memory impairment in patients suffering from AD. Aggregation of these plaques in the hippocampus appears during the development of the disease. One of the prominent factors having crucial impact in this process is MAPK. JNK, as a member of MAPK family has a pivotal role, especially in cell survival. We hypothesized that JNK may have beneficial effect on the process of memory improvement. Hence, we performed Morris water maze to investigate the possible impact of JNK inhibitor on spatial memory in Abeta-injected rats. Our data indicated that intracerebroventricular administration of SP600125, a JNK inhibitor, could significantly decrease escape latency and increase time spent in target quadrant, in treatment group. Furthermore, we evaluated some of the apoptotic factors in the hippocampus of the treated rats. Based on our data, the inhibitor led to the significant decrease in the amount of caspase-3, TUNEL positive cells, cyclooxygenase-2 and increase in Bcl-2/Bax ratio. Given the possible neuroprotective effects of SP600125 on Abeta-induced memory impairment and apoptosis, our results may open a new avenue for the treatment of AD.

21078556|t|Synthesis and SAR of indole-and 7-azaindole-1,3-dicarboxamide hydroxyethylamine inhibitors of BACE-1.
21078556|a|Heterocyclic replacement of the isophthalamide phenyl ring in hydroxyethylamine (HEA) BACE-1 inhibitors was explored. A variety of indole-1,3-dicarboxamide HEAs exhibited potent BACE-1 enzyme inhibition, but displayed poor cellular activity. Improvements in cellular activity and aspartic protease selectivity were observed for 7-azaindole-1,3-dicarboxamide HEAs. A methylprolinol-bearing derivative (10n) demonstrated robust reductions in rat plasma Abeta levels, but did not lower rat brain Abeta due to poor central exposure. The same analog exhibited a high efflux ratio in a bidirectional Caco-2 assay and was likely a substrate of the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein. X-ray crystal structures are reported for two indole HEAs in complex with BACE-1.

21081501|t|The purinergic receptor P2X7 triggers alpha-secretase-dependent processing of the amyloid precursor protein.
21081501|a|The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is cleaved by beta- and gamma-secretases to generate the beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides, which are present in large amounts in the amyloid plaques of Alzheimer disease (AD) patient brains. Non-amyloidogenic processing of APP by alpha-secretases leads to proteolytic cleavage within the Abeta peptide sequence and shedding of the soluble APP ectodomain (sAPPalpha), which has been reported to be endowed with neuroprotective properties. In this work, we have shown that activation of the purinergic receptor P2X7 (P2X7R) stimulates sAPPalpha release from mouse neuroblastoma cells expressing human APP, from human neuroblastoma cells and from mouse primary astrocytes or neural progenitor cells. sAPPalpha shedding is inhibited by P2X7R antagonists or knockdown of P2X7R with specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) and is not observed in neural cells from P2X7R-deficient mice. P2X7R-dependent APP-cleavage is independent of extracellular calcium and strongly inhibited by hydroxamate-based metalloprotease inhibitors, TAPI-2 and GM6001. However, knockdown of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-9 (ADAM9), ADAM10 and ADAM17 by specific siRNA, known to have alpha-secretase activity, does not block the P2X7R-dependent non-amyloidogenic pathway. Using several specific pharmacological inhibitors, we demonstrate that the mitogen-activated protein kinase modules Erk1/2 and JNK are involved in P2X7R-dependent alpha-secretase activity. Our study suggests that P2X7R, which is expressed in hippocampal neurons and glial cells, is a potential therapeutic target in AD.

21081502|t|Neuroprotection by minocycline caused by direct and specific scavenging of peroxynitrite.
21081502|a|Minocycline prevents oxidative protein modifications and damage in disease models associated with inflammatory glial activation and oxidative stress. Although the drug has been assumed to act by preventing the up-regulation of proinflammatory enzymes, we probed here its direct chemical interaction with reactive oxygen species. The antibiotic did not react with superoxide or ( )NO radicals, but peroxynitrite (PON) was scavenged in the range of ~1 mum minocycline and below. The interaction of pharmacologically relevant minocycline concentrations with PON was corroborated in several assay systems and significantly exceeded the efficacy of other antibiotics. Minocycline was degraded during the reaction with PON, and the resultant products lacked antioxidant properties. The antioxidant activity of minocycline extended to cellular systems, because it prevented neuronal mitochondrial DNA damage and glutathione depletion. Maintenance of neuronal viability under PON stress was shown to be solely dependent on direct chemical scavenging by minocycline. We chose alpha-synuclein (ASYN), known from Parkinsonian pathology as a biologically relevant target in chemical and cellular nitration reactions. Submicromolar concentrations of minocycline prevented tyrosine nitration of ASYN by PON. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that minocycline impeded nitrations more effectively than methionine oxidations and dimerizations of ASYN, which are secondary reactions under PON stress. Thus, PON scavenging at low concentrations is a novel feature of minocycline and may help to explain its pharmacological activity.

21084300|t|Processing of the synaptic cell adhesion molecule neurexin-3beta by Alzheimer disease alpha- and gamma-secretases.
21084300|a|Neurexins (NRXNs) are synaptic cell adhesion molecules having essential roles in the assembly and maturation of synapses into fully functional units. Immunocytochemical and electrophysiological studies have shown that specific binding across the synaptic cleft of the ectodomains of presynaptic NRXNs and postsynaptic neuroligins have the potential to bidirectionally coordinate and trigger synapse formation. Moreover, in vivo studies as well as genome-wide association studies pointed out implication of NRXNs in the pathogenesis of cognitive disorders including autism spectrum disorders and different types of addictions including opioid and alcohol dependences, suggesting an important role in synaptic function. Despite extensive investigations, the mechanisms by which NRXNs modulate the properties of synapses remain largely unknown. We report here that alpha- and gamma-secretases can sequentially process NRXN3beta, leading to the formation of two final products, an ~80-kDa N-terminal extracellular domain of Neurexin-3beta (sNRXN3beta) and an ~12-kDa C-terminal intracellular NRXN3beta domain (NRXN3beta-ICD), both of them being potentially implicated in the regulation of NRXNs and neuroligins functions at the synapses or in yet unidentified signal transduction pathways. We further report that this processing is altered by several PS1 mutations in the catalytic subunit of the gamma-secretase that cause early-onset familial Alzheimer disease.

21084313|a|(11)Carbon-Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography studies have suggested early and prominent amyloid deposition in the striatum in presenilin 1 mutation carriers. This cross-sectional study examines the (11)Carbon-Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography imaging profiles of presymptomatic and mildly affected (mini-mental state examination >= 20) carriers of seven presenilin 1 mutations, comparing them with groups of controls and symptomatic sporadic Alzheimer's disease cases. Parametric ratio images representing (11)Carbon-Pittsburgh compound B retention from 60 to 90 min were created using the pons as a reference region and nine regions of interest were studied. We confirmed that increased amyloid load may be detected in presymptomatic presenilin 1 mutation carriers with (11)Carbon-Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography and that the pattern of retention is heterogeneous. Comparison of presenilin 1 and sporadic Alzheimer's disease groups revealed significantly greater thalamic retention in the presenilin 1 group and significantly greater frontotemporal retention in the sporadic Alzheimer's disease group.

21093114|t|Self-organizing molecular field analysis on human beta-secretase nonpeptide inhibitors: 5, 5-disubstituted aminohydantoins.
21093114|a|5, 5-disubstituted aminohydantoins have been recently reported as potent and selective human beta-secretase (BACE-1) inhibitors. Self-Organizing Molecular Field Analysis (SOMFA) is used to study the correlation between the molecular properties and biological activities of the 5, 5-disubstituted aminohydantoins inhibitors. Four different alignments and two charge-assigning methods were investigated. The model derived from the superposition of docked conformation with AM1 charge showed satisfied predictive ability, which has good non-cross-validated r(2) (0.842), cross-validated q(2) (0.792), F-test value (254.75) and satisfied predictive ability r(2)(pred) (0.721). Analysis of SOMFA model may provide some useful information in the design of BACE-1 inhibitors with better spectrum of activity.

21094210|t|Biochemical, neuropathological, and neuroimaging characteristics of early-onset Alzheimer's disease due to a novel PSEN1 mutation.
21094210|a|Familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to PSEN1 mutations provides an opportunity to examine AD biomarkers in persons in whom the diagnosis is certain. We describe a 55 year-old woman with clinically probable AD and a novel PSEN1 mutation who underwent genetic, clinical, biochemical and magnetic resonance and nuclear imaging assessments. We also describe neuropathological findings in her similarly affected brother. Neuropsychological testing confirmed deficits in memory, visuospatial and language function. CSF t-tau and p-tau181 were markedly elevated and Abeta(42) levels reduced. FDG-PET revealed hypometabolism in the left parietotemporal cortex. FDDNP-PET showed increased binding of tracer in medial temporal and parietal lobes and in the head of the caudate and anterior putamen bilaterally. Neuropathological examination of her brother showed the typical findings of AD and the striatum demonstrated amyloid pathology and marked neurofibrillary pathology beyond that typically seen in late-onset AD. A novel S212Y substitution in PSEN1 was present in the index patient and her affected brother but not in an older unaffected sister. An in vitro assay in which the S212Y mutation was introduced in cell culture confirmed that it was associated with increased production of Abeta(42). We describe biochemical, imaging, and neuropathological changes in a pedigree with a novel PSEN1 mutation. This allows us to validate the pathogenicity of this mutation and the indices used to assess AD.

21095213|t|Hydrogen sulfide reduces mRNA and protein levels of beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 in PC12 cells.
21095213|a|Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) is now identified as a new neuromodulator. Increasing evidence suggest that H(2)S may play an important role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of H(2)S on beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1) expression and amyloid beta (Abeta) secretion in PC12 cells. The levels of BACE-1 mRNA were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. BACE-1 protein levels were assessed by Western blot. Cellular culture medium levels of Abeta1-42 were analyzed by ELISA. We found that sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), a H(2)S donor, decreased BACE-1 mRNA and protein levels and Abeta1-42 release. Furthermore, NaHS promoted the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK but not JNK or p38 MAPK. However, the effects of NaHS on BACE-1 expression and Abeta1-42 secretion were abolished by inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K), but not of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MEK). Our data indicate that H(2)S reduces BACE-1 expression in PC12 cells via activation of PI3-K/Akt signaling pathways. H(2)S releasing drugs may have therapeutic potential in AD patients.

21098486|t|Aromatic small molecules remodel toxic soluble oligomers of amyloid beta through three independent pathways.
21098486|a|In protein conformational disorders ranging from Alzheimer to Parkinson disease, proteins of unrelated sequence misfold into a similar array of aggregated conformers ranging from small oligomers to large amyloid fibrils. Substantial evidence suggests that small, prefibrillar oligomers are the most toxic species, yet to what extent they can be selectively targeted and remodeled into non-toxic conformers using small molecules is poorly understood. We have evaluated the conformational specificity and remodeling pathways of a diverse panel of aromatic small molecules against mature soluble oligomers of the Abeta42 peptide associated with Alzheimer disease. We find that small molecule antagonists can be grouped into three classes, which we herein define as Class I, II, and III molecules, based on the distinct pathways they utilize to remodel soluble oligomers into multiple conformers with reduced toxicity. Class I molecules remodel soluble oligomers into large, off-pathway aggregates that are non-toxic. Moreover, Class IA molecules also remodel amyloid fibrils into the same off-pathway structures, whereas Class IB molecules fail to remodel fibrils but accelerate aggregation of freshly disaggregated Abeta. In contrast, a Class II molecule converts soluble Abeta oligomers into fibrils, but is inactive against disaggregated and fibrillar Abeta. Class III molecules disassemble soluble oligomers (as well as fibrils) into low molecular weight species that are non-toxic. Strikingly, Abeta non-toxic oligomers (which are morphologically indistinguishable from toxic soluble oligomers) are significantly more resistant to being remodeled than Abeta soluble oligomers or amyloid fibrils. Our findings reveal that relatively subtle differences in small molecule structure encipher surprisingly large differences in the pathways they employ to remodel Abeta soluble oligomers and related aggregated conformers.

21102534|t|A multimeric immunogen for the induction of immune memory to beta-amyloid.
21102534|a|The development of active immunotherapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) requires the identification of immunogens that can ensure a high titer antibody response toward beta-amyloid, whereas minimizing the risks of a cell-mediated adverse reaction. We describe here two novel anti-beta-amyloid vaccines that consist of 'virus like particles' formed by a domain of the bacterial protein E2 that is able to self-assemble into a 60-mer peptide. Peptides 1-11 and 2-6 of beta-amyloid were displayed as N terminal fusions on the surface of the E2 particles. E2-based vaccines induced a fast-rising, robust and persistent antibody response to beta-amyloid in all vaccinated mice. The immune memory induced by a single administration of vaccine (1-11) E2 can be rapidly mobilized by a single booster injection, leading to a very high serum concentration of anti-beta-amyloid antibodies (above 1 mg ml(-1)). E2 vaccination polarizes the immune response toward the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-4 and does not induce a T cell response to beta-amyloid. Thus, E2-based vaccines are promising candidates for the development of immunotherapy protocols for AD.

21111015|t|The age- and amyloid-beta-related increases in Nogo B contribute to microglial activation.
21111015|a|The family of reticulons include three isoforms of the Nogo protein, Nogo A, Nogo B and Nogo C. Nogo A is expressed on neuronal tissue and its primary effect is widely acknowledged to be inhibition of neurite outgrowth. Although both Nogo B and Nogo C are also expressed in neuronal tissue, their roles in the CNS remain to be identified. In this study, we set out to assess whether expression of Nogo A or Nogo B was altered in tissue prepared from aged rats in which increased microglial activation is accompanied by decreased synaptic plasticity. The data indicate that Nogo B, but not Nogo A, was markedly increased in hippocampal tissue prepared from aged rats and that, at least in vitro, Nogo B increased several markers of microglial activation. In a striking parallel with the age-related changes, we demonstrate that intracerebroventricular delivery of amyloid-beta (Abeta)(1-40)+Abeta(1-42) for 8 days was associated with a depression of long-term potentiation (LTP) and an increase in markers of microglial activation and Nogo B. In both models, evidence of cell stress was identified by increased activity of caspases 8 and 3 and importantly, incubation of cultured neurons in the presence of Nogo B increased activity of both enzymes. The data identify, for the first time, an effect of Nogo B in the brain and specifically show that its expression is increased in conditions where synaptic plasticity is compromised.

21112317|t|Atorvastatin and pitavastatin improve cognitive function and reduce senile plaque and phosphorylated tau in aged APP mice.
21112317|a|In addition to simply reducing the serum level of cholesterol, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) have various pleiotrophic effects such as reducing oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neurotoxicity. However, such a pleiotrophic effect has not been fully studied in a new statin (pitavastatin). We examined and compared the effects of two strong statins (atorvastatin, 30 mg/kg/day, p.o.; pitavastatin, 3mg/kg/day, p.o.) on the serum level of lipids, cognitive dysfunction, senile plaque (SP) and phosphorylated tau-positive dystrophic neuritis (ptauDN) in amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic (Tg) mice from 5 months (M) of age to 20 M. These two statins improved behavioral memory and reduced the numbers of SP and ptauDN at 15 and 20 M without affecting serum lipid levels, but preserved mice brain weight in pitavastatin group at 20 M. These protective effects of statins took 10 M from the beginning of treatment to show an improvement in the present model mice, and sensitivity to the statin treatment was linked to behavioral memory, SP and ptauDN in this order. These findings suggest that early treatment with both atorvastatin and pitavastatin prevented subsequent worsening of cognitive function and the amyloidogenic process, probably due to pleiotrophic effects, suggesting a therapeutic potential for Alzheimer's disease (AD).

21113149|t|Reversing EphB2 depletion rescues cognitive functions in Alzheimer model.
21113149|a|Amyloid-beta oligomers may cause cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease by impairing neuronal NMDA-type glutamate receptors, whose function is regulated by the receptor tyrosine kinase EphB2. Here we show that amyloid-beta oligomers bind to the fibronectin repeats domain of EphB2 and trigger EphB2 degradation in the proteasome. To determine the pathogenic importance of EphB2 depletions in Alzheimer's disease and related models, we used lentiviral constructs to reduce or increase neuronal expression of EphB2 in memory centres of the mouse brain. In nontransgenic mice, knockdown of EphB2 mediated by short hairpin RNA reduced NMDA receptor currents and impaired long-term potentiation in the dentate gyrus, which are important for memory formation. Increasing EphB2 expression in the dentate gyrus of human amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice reversed deficits in NMDA receptor-dependent long-term potentiation and memory impairments. Thus, depletion of EphB2 is critical in amyloid-beta-induced neuronal dysfunction. Increasing EphB2 levels or function could be beneficial in Alzheimer's disease.

21113648|t|Pre-aggregated Abeta1-42 peptide increases tau aggregation and hyperphosphorylation after short-term application.
21113648|a|Neuritic amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, consisting of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, are the hallmarks of Alzheimer disease. It is not clear so far, how both structures are functionally and physiologically connected. We have investigated the role of Abeta1-42 on hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of tau in SY5Y cells by transfection and overexpression with two tau constructs, a shortened wildtype tau (2N4R) and a point mutation tau (P301L), found in fronto-temporal dementia. It was found that the tau protein becomes hyperphosphorylated and forms large aggregates inside cells, visualized by immunofluorescence, after short incubation of 90 min with preaggregated Abeta1-42. In Addition, Abeta1-42 caused a decrease of tau solubility in both tau constructs in this relatively short time period. Taken together, these experiments suggest that pathological preaggregated Abeta1-42 in physiological concentrations quickly induces hyperphosphorylation and pathological structural changes of tau protein and thereby directly linking the 'amyloid hypothesis' to tau pathology, observed in Alzheimer disease.

21114967|t|Long-term social isolation exacerbates the impairment of spatial working memory in APP/PS1 transgenic mice.
21114967|a|The interaction between gene and environment is known to play a major role in the etiology of several neuropsychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present study evaluated whether environmental manipulations such as social isolation may affect the genetic predisposition to accelerate the onset of AD-related symptoms in an adult APP/PS1 double mutant transgenic mouse model. Transgenic and wild-type male mice were housed either singly or in groups from the age of 3 months, and their behavior was compared at 7 months. Isolation had several effects on the APP/PS1 transgenic mice, including exacerbating the impairment of spatial working memory associated with increased Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio in the hippocampus; increased levels of MnSOD in the CA1-CA3 subregions of the hippocampus, basolateral part of the amygdala (BLA), and locus coeruleus (LC); and decreased numbers of cholinergic cells in the diagonal band of Broca (DB), noradrenergic neurons in LC, serotonergic neurons in the Raphe nucleus, and levels of NMDA 2B receptor (NR2B) in the hippocampus region. Our findings demonstrate the susceptibility of APP/PS1 transgenic adult male mice to environmental manipulation and show that social isolation has remarkable effects on the genetically determined AD-like symptoms.

21115069|t|Detection of age-dependent working memory deterioration in APP751SL mice.
21115069|a|Despite huge advances on Alzheimer's disease (AD) etiology, the clinical diagnosis remains the unique commonly used tool to detect the onset of the disease. For instance, epidemiological studies report that the combination of episodic and working memory disorders represents the most consistent sign of progression from mild cognitive impairment to AD. However, such working memory disorders failed to be observed early in transgenic mouse models of AD because the behavioral procedures used do not tackle properly crucial components of working memory. The aim of the present work was to assess early occurrence of working memory impairments in APP(751SL) mice. Therefore, we designed a new behavioral task in the water-maze, based on the principle of a delayed matching to place task, where spatial recognition was assessed for four different platform locations within a single session. First, we showed that dorsal hippocampal but not medial prefrontal cortex lesions in C57Bl6 mice induced a time-dependent impairment of spatial recognition. Then, the hippocampal-like memory alterations were reproduced in 7-8-month-old APP(751SL) mice but not in younger animals (5-6-month-old). We also demonstrated that these working memory deficits are related to progressive Abeta accumulation in the hippocampus, but not in the other selected brain structures.

21115476|t|Activation of D1/D5 dopamine receptors protects neurons from synapse dysfunction induced by amyloid-beta oligomers.
21115476|a|Soluble oligomers of the amyloid-beta peptide (AbetaOs) accumulate in the brains of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients and are implicated in synapse failure and early memory loss in AD. AbetaOs have been shown to impact synapse function by inhibiting long term potentiation, facilitating the induction of long term depression and inducing internalization of both AMPA and NMDA glutamate receptors, critical players in plasticity mechanisms. Because activation of dopamine D1/D5 receptors plays important roles in memory circuits by increasing the insertion of AMPA and NMDA receptors at synapses, we hypothesized that selective activation of D1/D5 receptors could protect synapses from the deleterious action of AbetaOs. We show that SKF81297, a selective D1/D5 receptor agonist, prevented the reduction in surface levels of AMPA and NMDA receptors induced by AbetaOs in hippocampal neurons in culture. Protection by SKF81297 was abrogated by the specific D1/D5 antagonist, SCH23390. Levels of AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 phosphorylated at Ser(845), which regulates AMPA receptor association with the plasma membrane, were reduced in a calcineurin-dependent manner in the presence of AbetaOs, and treatment with SKF81297 prevented this reduction. Establishing the functional relevance of these findings, SKF81297 blocked the impairment of long term potentiation induced by AbetaOs in hippocampal slices. Results suggest that D1/D5 receptors may be relevant targets for development of novel pharmacological approaches to prevent synapse failure in AD.

21116049|t|High-affinity rabbit monoclonal antibodies specific for amyloid peptides amyloid-beta40 and amyloid-beta42.
21116049|a|Antibodies that specifically bind to either amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) isoform Abeta40 or Abeta42 contribute to the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and to the development of cerebrospinal fluid-based tests for the probable diagnosis of AD. Polyclonal rabbit anti-Abeta antibodies possess high affinity and specificity, but their generation requires a long immunization period, and the resulting antibodies exhibit variable specificities and affinities. To secure a continuing supply of antibodies with uniform properties, we generated and partially characterized rabbit monoclonal antibodies specific for either Abeta40 or Abeta42. These antibodies possess nanomolar or sub-nanomolar dissociation constants and are at least 3,000-fold more selective for one isoform over the other. These antibodies are suitable for immunoblotting and, in a sandwich ELISA, RabmAb42 (anti-Abeta42) is sensitive enough to measure plasma levels of Abeta42. In addition, these antibodies have been applied to the immunohistology of Down syndrome and AD brain tissues, where they reveal fibrillar and diffuse amyloid deposits and are almost free of non-specific staining. The data indicate that diffuse amyloid deposits contain only minute amounts of Abeta40. Thus these rabbit monoclonal anti-Abeta antibodies can be widely applied in AD and Down syndrome research and diagnosis.

21116051|t|Endothelin-A receptor antagonists prevent amyloid-beta-induced increase in ETA receptor expression, oxidative stress, and cognitive impairment.
21116051|a|Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with abnormal accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) which can release endothelin (ET). The present study was conducted to investigate the effect of ET antagonists on Abeta-induced changes in ETA and ETB receptor expression, oxidative stress, and cognitive impairment. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with Abeta1-40 in the lateral cerebral ventricles and were administered vehicle or ET antagonists for 14 days. Abeta treatment produced an increase in ETA receptor expression in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and brain stem by 72%, 85%, and 90%, respectively. No change in ETB receptor expression was observed. There was an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) and decrease in reduced glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels in Abeta-treated rats. In the Morris swim task, Abeta treated rats showed a significant impairment in spatial memory. ET receptor antagonists, BQ123, BMS182874, and TAK-044, significantly decreased Abeta-induced increase in ETA expression in the cortex, hippocampus, and brain stem. Rats treated with ET antagonists showed significant attenuation of Abeta-induced changes in the brain MDA, GSH, and SOD levels. Rats treated with specific ETA receptor antagonists, BQ123 and BMS182874, significantly reduced the cognitive impairment induced by Abeta. However, nonspecific ETA/ETB receptor antagonist TAK-044 did not show any improvement in the learning and memory parameter. This study demonstrates that ETA receptor antagonists are effective in preventing cognitive impairment, changes in ETA expression and oxidative stress induced by Abeta. It is concluded that ETA receptor antagonists may be useful in improving cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease.

21116052|t|Functional interactions of fibrillar and oligomeric amyloid-beta with alpha7 nicotinic receptors in Alzheimer's disease.
21116052|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) assemble into various aggregation forms that differ in size, structure, and functional properties. Previous studies have shown that Abeta binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and activates signaling cascades that result in the disruption of synaptic functions. These findings suggest a possible link between impaired cholinergic neurotransmitter function in AD and Abeta pathogenesis. However, it is not yet known how the different Abeta assemblies interact with specific nAChR subtypes. In the present study, we demonstrate that neurotoxicity in neuronal cells in culture induced by fibrillar Abeta(1-40) is prevented through an alpha7 nAChR-dependent mechanism. The alpha7 nAChR agonists varenicline and JN403 increased binding of the amyloid ligand [3H]PIB to fibrillar Abeta in AD frontal cortex autopsy tissue. This suggests that the presence of nAChR agonists may inhibit interaction of Abeta with alpha7 nAChRs and prevent the formation of Abeta/alpha7 nAChR complexes. This interaction was confirmed in binding assays with [125I]Abeta(1-40) and alpha7 nAChRs in autopsy brain tissue homogenates from the frontal cortex. The functional effects of Abeta fibrils and oligomers on nAChRs were examined by measuring intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i) levels. Oligomeric, but not fibrillar Abeta(1-40), increased [Ca(2+)](i) in neuronal cells, and this effect was attenuated by varenicline. Our findings demonstrate that fibrillar Abeta exerts neurotoxic effects mediated partly through a blockade of alpha7 nAChRs, whilst oligomeric Abeta may act as a ligand activating alpha7 nAChRs, thereby stimulating downstream signaling pathways.

21116053|t|Transcranial laser therapy attenuates amyloid-beta peptide neuropathology in amyloid-beta protein precursor transgenic mice.
21116053|a|Transcranial laser therapy (TLT) was tested for efficacy in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using a near-infrared energy laser system. TLT is thought to stimulate ATP production, increase mitochondrial activity, and help maintain neuronal function. Studies were performed to determine the effect of TLT in an amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) transgenic mouse model. TLT was administered 3 times/week at various doses, starting at 3 months of age, and was compared to a control group (no laser treatment). Treatment was continued for a total of six months. Animals were examined for amyloid load, inflammatory markers, brain amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels, plasma Abeta levels, cerebrospinal fluid Abeta levels, soluble AbetaPP (sAbetaPP) levels, and behavioral changes. The numbers of Abeta plaques were significantly reduced in the brain with administration of TLT in a dose-dependent fashion. Administration of TLT was associated with a dose-dependent reduction in amyloid load. All TLT doses mitigated the behavioral effects seen with advanced amyloid deposition and reduce the expression of inflammatory markers in the AbetaPP transgenic mice. All TLT doses produced an increase in sAbetaPPalpha and a decrease in CTFbeta levels consistent with inhibition of the beta-secretase activity. In addition, TLT showed an increase in ATP levels, mitochondrial function, and c-fos suggesting an overall improvement in neurological function. These studies suggest that TLT is a potential candidate for treatment of AD.

21118811|t|Apolipoprotein E4 domain interaction mediates detrimental effects on mitochondria and is a potential therapeutic target for Alzheimer disease.
21118811|a|Apolipoprotein (apo) E4 is the major genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD). ApoE4 assumes a pathological conformation through an intramolecular interaction mediated by Arg-61 in the amino-terminal domain and Glu-255 in the carboxyl-terminal domain, referred to as apoE4 domain interaction. Because AD is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, we examined the effect of apoE4 domain interaction on mitochondrial respiratory function. Steady-state amounts of mitochondrial respiratory complexes were examined in neurons cultured from brain cortices of neuron-specific enolase promoter-driven apoE3 (NSE-apoE3) or apoE4 (NSE-apoE4) transgenic mice. All subunits of mitochondrial respiratory complexes assessed were significantly lower in NSE-apoE4 neurons compared with NSE-apoE3 neurons. However, no significant differences in levels of mitochondrial complexes were detected between astrocytes expressing different apoE isoforms driven by the glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter, leading to our conclusion that the effect of apoE4 is neuron specific. In neuroblastoma Neuro-2A (N2A) cells, apoE4 expression reduced the levels of mitochondrial respiratory complexes I, IV, and V. Complex IV enzymatic activity was also decreased, lowering mitochondrial respiratory capacity. Mutant apoE4 (apoE4-Thr-61) lacking domain interaction did not induce mitochondrial dysfunction in N2A cells, indicating that the effect is specific to apoE4-expressing cells and dependent on domain interaction. Consistent with this finding, treatment of apoE4-expressing N2A cells with a small molecule that disrupts apoE4 domain interaction restored mitochondrial respiratory complex IV levels. These results suggest that pharmacological intervention with small molecules that disrupt apoE4 domain interaction is a potential therapeutic approach for apoE4-carrying AD subjects.

21128591|t|4-[18F]fluoroglutamic acid (BAY 85-8050), a new amino acid radiotracer for PET imaging of tumors: synthesis and in vitro characterization.
21128591|a|There is a high demand for tumor specific PET tracers in oncology imaging. Besides glucose, certain amino acids also serve as energy sources and anabolic precursors for tumors. Therefore, (18)F-labeled amino acids are interesting probes for tumor specific PET imaging. As glutamine and glutamate play a key role in the adapted intermediary metabolism of tumors, the radiosynthesis of 4-[(18)F]fluoro l-glutamic acid (BAY 85-8050) as a new specific PET tracer was established. Cell-uptake studies revealed specific tumor cell accumulation.

21129451|t|Distinct adrenergic system changes and neuroinflammation in response to induced locus ceruleus degeneration in APP/PS1 transgenic mice.
21129451|a|Degeneration of locus ceruleus (LC) neurons and subsequent reduction of norepinephrine (NE) in LC projection areas represent an early pathological indicator of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In order to study the effects of NE depletion on cortical and hippocampal adrenergic system changes, LC degeneration was induced in 3-month-old APP/PS1 mice by the neurotoxin N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-bromo-benzylamine (dsp4). Dsp4 induced a widespread loss of norepinephrine transporter binding in multiple brain structures already at 4.5 months. This was accompanied by changes of alpha-1-, alpha-2-, and beta-1-adreneroceptor binding sites as well as altered adrenoceptor mRNA expression. In parallel, we observed increased micro- and astrogliosis in cortical and hippocampal structures in dsp4-treated groups. In addition, the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines CCL2 and IL-1beta were induced in both, dsp4-treated and APP/PS1-transgenic mice, whereas IL-1alpha was only up-regulated in dsp4-treated APP/PS1 mice. Concerning amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition, we observed an elevation of Abeta1-42 levels in aged dsp4-treated APP/PS1 mice. These data support the hypothesis that LC degeneration leads to dysregulation of adrenergic receptors and exacerbation of Abeta-induced neuroinflammation, both of which are exploitable for early disease marker development.

21134399|t|A method to solubilise protein aggregates for immunoassay quantification which overcomes the neurofilament "hook" effect.
21134399|a|INTRODUCTION: Neurofilament (Nf) aggregates are a common pathological feature of neurodegenerative disorders. Although Nf levels have been investigated as a potential disease biomarker, Nf aggregates may mask Nf epitopes, preventing accurate quantification by immunoassay. Using the SOD1(G93A) mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, we developed a method to disrupt Nf aggregates, allowing optimal immunoassay performance. METHODS: Phosphorylated (NfH(SMI35)) and hyperphosphorylated (NfH(SMI34)) Nf levels in plasma from 120-day SOD1(G93A) mice were quantified using an in-house ELISA modified for use with small volumes. Different pre-analytical methods were tested for their ability to solubilize Nf aggregates and immunoblotting was used for qualitative analysis. RESULTS: A 'hook effect' was observed for serially diluted plasma samples quantified using an ELISA originally developed for CSF samples. Immunoblotting confirmed the existence of high molecular-weight NfH aggregates in plasma and the resolving effect of timed urea on these aggregates. Thermostatic (pre-thawing) and chemical (calcium chelators, urea) pre-analytical processing of samples had variable success in disrupting NfH aggregates. Timed urea-calcium chelator incubation yielded the most consistent plasma NfH levels. A one hour sample pre-incubation with 0.5M urea in Barbitone-EDTA buffer at room temperature resolved the "hook effect" without compromising the ELISA. In SOD1(G93A) mice, median levels of NfH(SMI34) were over 10-fold and NfH(SMI35) levels 5-fold greater than controls. CONCLUSION: NfH aggregates can be solubilised and the "hook effect" abolished by a one-hour sample pre-incubation in a urea-calcium chelator-enriched buffer. This method is applicable for quantification of NfH phosphoforms in experimental and disease settings where Nf aggregate formation occurs.

21134458|t|Calcineurin inhibition with FK506 ameliorates dendritic spine density deficits in plaque-bearing Alzheimer model mice.
21134458|a|Synapse loss is the strongest correlate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease, and synapses are an attractive therapeutic target due to their plastic nature that allows for potential recovery with intervention. We have previously demonstrated in transgenic mice that form senile plaques that dendrites surrounding plaques become dystrophic and lose postsynaptic dendritic spines. Furthermore, we found strong evidence that plaque-associated dendritic changes are mediated by calcineurin, a calcium-dependent phosphatase involved in cell signaling, using in vitro models and genetically encoded inhibitors in mouse models. In this study, we pharmacologically inhibited calcineurin with FK506 treatment to test the hypothesis that calcineurin inhibition will allow recovery of plaque-associated synapse loss. We found that in plaque bearing transgenic mice, short term (1 week) FK506 treatment results in an amelioration of dendritic spine loss. We also observe an effect on spine morphology in wild-type mice with FK506 treatment. These data show that systemic FK506 administration, and hence calcineurin inhibition, may be neuroprotective for amyloid beta induced synaptic alterations.

21135968|t|Clarifying the influence of core amino acid hydrophobicity, secondary structure propensity, and molecular volume on amyloid-beta 16-22 self-assembly.
21135968|a|The self-assembly of amyloid peptides is influenced by hydrophobicity, charge, secondary structure propensity, and sterics. Previous experiments have shown that increasing hydrophobicity at the aromatic positions of the amyloid-beta 16-22 fragment (Abeta(16-22)) without introducing steric restraints greatly increases the rate of self-assembly and thermodynamically stabilizes the resulting fibrils [Senguen et al., Mol. BioSyst., 2011, DOI: 10.1039/c0mb00080a]. Conversely, when increasing side chain hydrophobicity coincides with an increase in side chain volume, the increase in the rate of self-assembly is offset by a thermodynamic destabilization of the resulting amyloid fibrils when direct cross-strand side chain interactions occur. These findings indicate that steric effects also influence the self-assembly of amyloidogenic peptides. Herein, the aromatic Phe residues at positions 19, 20, and 19,20 of Abeta(16-22) have been systematically replaced by Val, Leu, Ile, or hexafluoroleucine (Hfl) and amyloid formation has been characterized. The Val variants, despite the high beta-sheet propensity of Val, were thermodynamically destabilized (DeltaDeltaG = +0.1-0.4 kcal mol(-1)) relative to the wild-type with the double mutant failing to self-assemble at the concentrations studied. Conversely, the Leu and Ile variants formed fibrils at enhanced rates relative to wild-type and exhibited similar, or in some cases enhanced thermodynamic stabilities relative to the wild-type (DeltaDeltaG = 0-0.6 kcal mol(-1)). The more hydrophobic Hfl variants were greatly stabilized (DeltaDeltaG = -0.3-2.1 kcal mol(-1)) relative to the wild-type. These data indicate that hydrophobicity and steric effects both influence peptide self-assembly processes, including nucleation and fibrillization rates and the thermodynamic stability of the resulting fibrils.

21136067|t|In vivo multiphoton imaging reveals gradual growth of newborn amyloid plaques over weeks.
21136067|a|The kinetics of amyloid plaque formation and growth as one of the characteristic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are fundamental issues in AD research. Especially the question how fast amyloid plaques grow to their final size after they are born remains controversial. By long-term two-photon in vivo imaging we monitored individual methoxy-X04-stained amyloid plaques over 6 weeks in 12 and 18 months old Tg2576 mice. We found that in 12 months old mice, newly appearing amyloid plaques were initially small in volume and subsequently grew over time. The growth rate of plaques was inversely proportional to their volume; thus amyloid plaques that were already present at the first imaging time point grew over time but slower compared to new plaques. Additionally, we analyzed 18 months old Tg2576 mice in which we neither found newly appearing plaques nor a significant growth of pre-existing plaques over 6 weeks of imaging. In conclusion, newly appearing amyloid plaques are initially small in size but grow over time until plaque growth can not be detected anymore in aged mice. These results suggest that drugs that target plaque formation should be most effective early in the disease, when plaques are growing.

21138436|t|Wnt signaling pathway overcomes the disruption of neuronal differentiation of neural progenitor cells induced by oligomeric amyloid beta-peptide.
21138436|a|Neural stem cells give rise to new hippocampal neurons throughout adulthood. Defects in neurogenesis are associated with cognitive dysfunctions, such as Alzheimer disease (AD). Our understanding of the signals controlling this process is limited. The present in vitro study explored the manner in which the Wnt signaling pathway regulates the differentiation of hippocampal progenitors (HPs) into neurons under the influence of amyloid beta(42) (Abeta(42) ). The results showed that oligomeric Abeta(42) reduced neuronal differentiation. This process was accompanied by a reduction in active beta-catenin levels and proneural gene expression. The addition of Wnt3a increased the neuronal differentiation of Abeta(42) -treated HPs, at the expense of astrocyte differentiation. The effect of Wnt signaling was attributable to progenitor cell differentiation to the neuronal lineage, and not to increased proliferation or rescue of neurons. The interruption of Wnt signaling by oligomeric Abeta(42) may have clinical implications for the treatment of impaired neurogenesis in AD.

21142943|a|In this study, the protective effects of 17 Korean native plants against amyloid beta peptide (Abeta)-induced oxidative stress were screened using the 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate assay and the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Ipomoea batatas exerted the highest protective effects against oxidative stress and was selected for further investigation. To confirm the protective activity of this extract, the I. batatas extract was fed to ICR mice that had been injected with Abeta to induce neuronal deficits. In these experiments, the extract of I. batatas significantly reversed Abeta-induced neurotoxicity as assessed by the passive avoidance test, a behavioral experiment. Moreover, I. batatas administration reduced the level of lipid peroxidation and increased catalase activities in biochemical studies using the brain tissue of mice. These results indicate that I. batatas might be beneficial against Alzheimer's disease, especially by limiting oxidative stress in the brain.

21143716|t|Alzheimer's disease-associated ubiquilin-1 regulates presenilin-1 accumulation and aggresome formation.
21143716|a|The Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated ubiquilin-1 regulates proteasomal degradation of proteins, including presenilin (PS). PS-dependent gamma-secretase generates beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides, which excessively accumulate in AD brain. Here, we have characterized the effects of naturally occurring ubiquilin-1 transcript variants (TVs) on the levels and subcellular localization of PS1 and other gamma-secretase complex components and subsequent gamma-secretase function in human embryonic kidney 293, human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y and mouse primary cortical cells. Full-length ubiquilin-1 TV1 and TV3 that lacks the proteasome-interaction domain increased full-length PS1 levels as well as induced accumulation of high-molecular-weight PS1 and aggresome formation. Accumulated PS1 colocalized with TV1 or TV3 in the aggresomes. Electron microscopy indicated that aggresomes containing TV1 or TV3 were targeted to autophagosomes. TV1- and TV3-expressing cells did not accumulate other unrelated proteasome substrates, suggesting that the increase in PS1 levels was not because of a general impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Furthermore, PS1 accumulation and aggresome formation coincided with alterations in Abeta levels, particularly in cells overexpressing TV3. These effects were not related to altered gamma-secretase activity or PS1 binding to TV3. Collectively, our results indicate that specific ubiquilin-1 TVs can cause PS1 accumulation and aggresome formation, which may impact AD pathogenesis or susceptibility.

21144622|t|Synthesis and biophysical evaluation of arylhydrazono-1H-2-indolinones as beta-amyloid aggregation inhibitors.
21144622|a|A series of isatin-3-arylhydrazones were synthesized and evaluated in vitro as inhibitors of Abeta(1-40) aggregation using a thioflavin T fluorescence method. An exploration of the effects on Abeta(1-40) aggregation of a number of diverse substituents at phenylhydrazone group and 5,6- positions of the indolinone nucleus led us to single out some new anti-aggregating compounds with IC(50) values in the low micromolar range. The most active compounds carry methoxy- or hydroxy- substituents in the indolinone 5,6-positions and lipophilic groups such as iPr and Cl at 4'- and 3'-position, respectively, of the phenylhydrazone moiety. Two derivatives are noteworthy, namely 18 (IC(50) = 0.4 muM) and 42 (IC(50) = 1.1 muM). The in vitro effects of the highly active, water soluble, compound 42 on the temporal evolution of Abeta(1-40) fibrils formation were further investigated by circular dichroism spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering studies, which clearly showed that this compound delayed and lowered the amyloid fibril formation.

21144907|t|Genistein ameliorates learning and memory deficits in amyloid beta(1-40) rat model of Alzheimer's disease.
21144907|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by increased beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition and neuronal dysfunction leading to impaired learning and recall. Ageing, heredity, and induced oxidative stress are among proposed risk factors. The increased frequency of the disease in women also suggests a role for estrogen in development of AD. In the present study, effects of the phytoestrogen genistein (10mg/kg) on learning and memory impairments was assessed in intrahippocampal Abeta(1-40)-injected rats. The estrogen receptor antagonist fulvestrant was injected intracerebroventricularly in a group of Abeta-lesioned rats. The Abeta-injected animals exhibited the following: lower spontaneous alternation score in Y-maze tasks, impaired retention and recall capability in the passive avoidance test, and fewer correct choices and more errors in the RAM task. Genistein, but not genistein and fulvestrant, significantly improved most of these parameters. Measurements of oxidative stress markers in hippocampal tissue of Abeta-injected rats showed an elevation of malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitrite content, and a reduction of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Genistein significantly attenuated the increased MDA content but did not affect the nitrite content or SOD activity. These results indicate that genistein pretreatment ameliorates Abeta-induced impairment of short-term spatial memory in rats through an estrogenic pathway and by inducing attenuation of oxidative stress.

21145738|t|Diphenylpropynone derivatives as probes for imaging beta-amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's brains.
21145738|a|A new series of diphenylpropynone (DPP) derivatives for use in vivo to image beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) were synthesized and characterized. Binding experiments in vitro revealed high affinity for Abeta (1-42) aggregates at a K(i) value ranging from 6 to 326 nM. Furthermore, specific labeling of plaques was observed in sections of brain tissue from Tg2576 transgenic mice stained using one of the compounds, 1. In biodistribution experiments with normal mice, [(125)I]1 displayed moderate uptake (1.55%ID/g at 2 min) and clearance from the brain with time (0.76 ID/g at 60 min). Taken together, DPP can serve as a new molecular scaffold for developing novel Abeta imaging agents by introducing appropriate substituted groups.

21147772|t|Iron promotes the toxicity of amyloid beta peptide by impeding its ordered aggregation.
21147772|a|We have previously shown that overexpressing subunits of the iron-binding protein ferritin can rescue the toxicity of the amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide in our Drosophila model system. These data point to an important pathogenic role for iron in Alzheimer disease. In this study, we have used an iron-selective chelating compound and RNAi-mediated knockdown of endogenous ferritin to further manipulate iron in the brain. We confirm that chelation of iron protects the fly from the harmful effects of Abeta. To understand the pathogenic mechanisms, we have used biophysical techniques to see how iron affects Abeta aggregation. We find that iron slows the progression of the Abeta peptide from an unstructured conformation to the ordered cross-beta fibrils that are characteristic of amyloid. Finally, using mammalian cell culture systems, we have shown that iron specifically enhances Abeta toxicity but only if the metal is present throughout the aggregation process. These data support the hypothesis that iron delays the formation of well ordered aggregates of Abeta and so promotes its toxicity in Alzheimer disease.

21147781|t|Rho kinase II phosphorylation of the lipoprotein receptor LR11/SORLA alters amyloid-beta production.
21147781|a|LR11, also known as SorLA, is a mosaic low-density lipoprotein receptor that exerts multiple influences on Alzheimer disease susceptibility. LR11 interacts with the amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) and regulates APP traffic and processing to amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta). The functional domains of LR11 suggest that it can act as a cell surface receptor and as an intracellular sorting receptor for trans-Golgi network to endosome traffic. We show that LR11 over-expressed in HEK293 cells is radiolabeled following incubation of cells with [(32)P(i)]orthophosphate. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to discover putative LR11 interacting kinases. Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK) 2 was identified as a binding partner and a candidate kinase acting on LR11. LR11 and ROCK2 co-immunoprecipitate from post-mortem human brain tissue and drug inhibition of ROCK activity reduces LR11 phosphorylation in vivo. Targeted knockdown of ROCK2 with siRNA decreased LR11 ectodomain shedding while simultaneously increasing intracellular LR11 protein level. Site-directed mutagenesis of serine 2206 in the LR11 cytoplasmic tail reduced LR11 shedding, decreased LR11 phosphorylation in vitro, and abrogated LR11 mediated Abeta reduction. These findings provide direct evidence that LR11 is phosphorylated in vivo and indicate that ROCK2 phosphorylation of LR11 may enhance LR11 mediated processing of APP and amyloid production.

21148556|t|Repeat domains of melanosome matrix protein Pmel17 orthologs form amyloid fibrils at the acidic melanosomal pH.
21148556|a|Most amyloids are pathological, but fragments of Pmel17 form a functional amyloid in vertebrate melanosomes essential for melanin synthesis and deposition. We previously reported that only at the mildly acidic pH (4-5.5) typical of melanosomes, the repeat domain (RPT) of human Pmel17 can form amyloid in vitro. Combined with the known presence of RPT in the melanosome filaments and the requirement of this domain for filament formation, we proposed that RPT may be the core of the amyloid formed in vivo. Although most of Pmel17 is highly conserved across a broad range of vertebrates, the RPT domains vary dramatically, with no apparent homology in some cases. Here, we report that the RPT domains of mouse and zebrafish, as well as a small splice variant of human Pmel17, all form amyloid specifically at mildly acid pH (pH ~5.0). Protease digestion, mass per unit length measurements, and solid-state NMR experiments suggest that amyloid of the mouse RPT has an in-register parallel beta-sheet architecture with two RPT molecules per layer, similar to amyloid of the Abeta peptide. Although there is no sequence conservation between human and zebrafish RPT, amyloid formation at acid pH is conserved.

21148560|t|Overexpression of glutaminyl cyclase, the enzyme responsible for pyroglutamate A{beta} formation, induces behavioral deficits, and glutaminyl cyclase knock-out rescues the behavioral phenotype in 5XFAD mice.
21148560|a|Pyroglutamate-modified Abeta (AbetapE3-42) peptides are gaining considerable attention as potential key players in the pathology of Alzheimer disease (AD) due to their abundance in AD brain, high aggregation propensity, stability, and cellular toxicity. Overexpressing AbetapE3-42 induced a severe neuron loss and neurological phenotype in TBA2 mice. In vitro and in vivo experiments have recently proven that the enzyme glutaminyl cyclase (QC) catalyzes the formation of AbetapE3-42. The aim of the present work was to analyze the role of QC in an AD mouse model with abundant AbetapE3-42 formation. 5XFAD mice were crossed with transgenic mice expressing human QC (hQC) under the control of the Thy1 promoter. 5XFAD/hQC bigenic mice showed significant elevation in TBS, SDS, and formic acid-soluble AbetapE3-42 peptides and aggregation in plaques. In 6-month-old 5XFAD/hQC mice, a significant motor and working memory impairment developed compared with 5XFAD. The contribution of endogenous QC was studied by generating 5XFAD/QC-KO mice (mouse QC knock-out). 5XFAD/QC-KO mice showed a significant rescue of the wild-type mice behavioral phenotype, demonstrating the important contribution of endogenous mouse QC and transgenic overexpressed QC. These data clearly demonstrate that QC is crucial for modulating AbetapE3-42 levels in vivo and prove on a genetic base the concept that reduction of QC activity is a promising new therapeutic approach for AD.

21153383|t|Quantitative approaches to amyloid imaging.
21153383|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), an irreversible, progressive neurodegenerative disorder clinically characterized by memory loss and cognitive decline, is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly, leading invariably to death within 7-10 years after diagnosis. In vivo amyloid imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) is allowing new insights into beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition in the brain, facilitating research into the causes, diagnosis, and future treatment of dementias, where Abeta may play a role. Non-invasive quantification of Abeta burden in the brain with PET has proven useful in the early and differential diagnosis of dementias, showing significantly higher retention in grey matter of AD patients when compared with healthy controls (HC) or patients with frontotemporal lobe degeneration (FTLD). With the advent of new therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing Abeta burden in the brain to potentially prevent or delay functional and irreversible cognitive loss, there is increased interest in developing agents that allow assessment of Abeta burden in vivo. A key aspect for Abeta burden quantification is the application of compartmental or graphical analyses to the kinetic data in order to obtain quantitative and reproducible statements that allow comparison with other nosological groups, correlation with cognitive or biological parameters, and selection, monitoring, and follow-up of individuals in disease modifying therapeutic trials. It is also a necessary step in the validation of simplified approaches that could be applied in routine clinical settings. With the availability of novel amyloid imaging agents radiolabeled with either (11)C (half-life 20 min) or (18)F (half-life 110 min), a description of different image acquisition approaches is provided.

21155974|t|A comparison of the biochemical modifications caused by toxic and non-toxic protein oligomers in cells.
21155974|a|Peptides and proteins can convert from their soluble forms into highly ordered fibrillar aggregates, giving rise to pathological conditions ranging from neurodegenerative disorders to systemic amyloidoses. It is increasingly recognized that protein oligomers forming early in the process of fibril aggregation represent the pathogenic species in protein deposition diseases. The N-terminal domain of the HypF protein from Escherichia coli (HypF-N) has previously been shown to form, under distinct conditions, two types of HypF-N oligomers with indistinguishable morphologies but distinct structural features at the molecular level. Only the oligomer type exposing hydrophobic surfaces and possessing sufficient structural plasticity is toxic (type A), whereas the other type is benign to cultured cells (type B). Here we show that only type A oligomers are able to induce a Ca(2+)  influx from the cell medium to the cytosol, to penetrate the plasma membrane, to increase intracellular reactive oxygen species production, lipid peroxidation and release of intracellular calcein, resulting in the activation of the apoptotic pathway. Remarkably, these oligomers can also induce a loss of cholinergic neurons when injected into rat brains. By contrast, markers of cellular stress and viability were unaffected in cultured and rat neuronal cells exposed to type B oligomers. The analysis of the time scales of such effects indicates that the difference of toxicity between the two oligomer types involve the early events of the toxicity cascade, shedding new light on the mechanism of action of protein oligomers and on the molecular targets for the therapeutic intervention against protein deposition diseases.

21157020|t|Increasing the predictive accuracy of amyloid-beta blood-borne biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease.
21157020|a|Diagnostic measures for Alzheimer's disease (AD) commonly rely on evaluating the levels of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of affected individuals. These levels are often combined with levels of an additional non-Abeta marker to increase predictive accuracy. Recent efforts to overcome the invasive nature of CSF collection led to the observation of Abeta species within the blood cellular fraction, however, little is known of what additional biomarkers may be found in this membranous fraction. The current study aimed to undertake a discovery-based proteomic investigation of the blood cellular fraction from AD patients (n = 18) and healthy controls (HC; n = 15) using copper immobilized metal affinity capture and Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption/Ionisation Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry. Three candidate biomarkers were observed which could differentiate AD patients from HC (ROC AUC > 0.8). Bivariate pairwise comparisons revealed significant correlations between these markers and measures of AD severity including; MMSE, composite memory, brain amyloid burden, and hippocampal volume. A partial least squares regression model was generated using the three candidate markers along with blood levels of Abeta. This model was able to distinguish AD from HC with high specificity (90%) and sensitivity (77%) and was able to separate individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who converted to AD from MCI non-converters. While requiring further characterization, these candidate biomarkers reaffirm the potential efficacy of blood-based investigations into neurodegenerative conditions. Furthermore, the findings indicate that the incorporation of non-amyloid markers into predictive models, function to increase the accuracy of the diagnostic potential of Abeta.

21157025|t|Neuronal hemoglobin is reduced in Alzheimer's disease, argyrophilic grain disease, Parkinson's disease, and dementia with Lewy bodies.
21157025|a|Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of hemoglobin alpha-chain and beta-chain in neurons of the rodent and human brain thus indicating that hemoglobin is a normal component of nerve cells and that hemoglobin may play a role in intraneuronal oxygen homeostasis. Progressing with these studies, hemoglobin expression has been examined in selected cell population in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD), argyrophilic grain disease (AGD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Double labeling immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy revealed reduced hemoglobin alpha-chain and beta-chain in practically all neurons with small amounts of granular or punctuate hyperphosphorylated tau deposits and in neurons with tangles in the hippocampus and frontal cortex in AD and in the hippocampus in AGD; in ballooned neurons containing alphaB-crystallin in the amygdala in AD and AGD; and in about 80% of neurons with punctuate alpha-synuclein deposits and in neurons with Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra pars compacta and in vulnerable neurons of the medulla oblongata in PD and DLB; and in neurons with Lewy bodies in the frontal cortex in DLB. Hemoglobin immunoreactivity was also observed in the core of neuritic plaques and in diffuse plaques, but not in dystrophic neurites. Loss of hemoglobin was specific as neuroglobin was present equally in neurons with and without abnormal protein inclusions, and erythropoietin receptor was expressed equally in neurons without and in neurons with abnormal protein aggregates in AD, AGD, PD, and DLB.

21157027|t|Folic acid plus alpha-tocopherol mitigates amyloid-beta-induced neurotoxicity through modulation of mitochondrial complexes activity.
21157027|a|Early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been attributed to amyloid-beta (Abeta) toxicity. The pathophysiology of AD is complex and involves several different biochemical pathways, including defective Abeta protein metabolism, neuroinflammation, oxidative processes, and mitochondrial dysfunction. In the current study, we assessed the molecular mechanisms, mainly the modifications in the activity of mitochondrial complexes, whereby the association of folic acid and alpha-tocopherol protects mice against the Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. Oral treatment with folic acid (50 mg/kg) plus alpha-tocopherol (500 mg/kg), once a day during 14 consecutive days, protected mice against the Abeta1-40-induced cognitive decline, synaptic loss, and neuronal death. However, chronic treatment comprising folic acid plus alpha-tocopherol was ineffective on Abeta-induced glial cell activation, suggesting that the effect of this treatment is independent of anti-inflammatory features. Interestingly, the results obtained in our study suggest that mitochondrial energy metabolism is impaired by the Abeta peptide, and upregulation of mitochondrial genes may be a compensatory response, as demonstrated by the increase in mitochondrial complexes I, II, and IV activity, in the hippocampus of mice, after Abeta1-40 injection. Of note, the chronic treatment comprising folic acid plus alpha-tocopherol prevented the increase in the activity of mitochondrial complexes I and IV induced by Abeta1-40. Together, these results show the antioxidant effect of the combination of folic acid and alpha-tocopherol, as observed by the decrease in NO generation from iNOS and nNOS, preventing an increase in the activity of mitochondrial complexes, mainly I and IV, and the neuronal death induced by the Abeta1-40 peptide.

21158384|t|Structural polymorphism of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) oligomers highlights the importance of interfacial residue interactions.
21158384|a|A 37-residue of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP or amylin) is a main component of amyloid plaques found in the pancreas of ~90% of type II diabetes patients. It is reported that hIAPP oligomers, rather than mature fibrils, are major toxic species responsible for pancreatic islet beta-cell dysfunction and even cell death, but molecular structures of these oligomers remain elusive. In this work, on the basis of recent solid-state NMR and mass-per-length (MPL) data, we model a series of hIAPP oligomers with different beta-layers (one, two, and three layers), symmetries (symmetry and asymmetry), and associated interfaces using molecular dynamics simulations. Three distinct interfaces formed by C-terminal beta-sheet and C-terminal beta-sheet (CC), N-terminal beta-sheet and N-terminal beta-sheet (NN), and C-terminal beta-sheet and N-terminal beta-sheet (CN) are identified to drive multiple cross-beta-layers laterally associated together to form different amyloid organizations via different intermolecular interactions, in which the CC interface is dominated by polar interactions, the NN interface is dominated by hydrophobic interactions, and the CN interface is dominated by mixed polar and hydrophobic interactions. Overall, the structural stability of the proposed hIAPP oligomers is a result of delicate balance between maximization of favorable peptide-peptide interactions at the interfaces and optimization of solvation energy with globular structure. Different hIAPP oligomeric models indicate a general and intrinsic nature of amyloid polymorphism, driven by different interfacial side-chain interactions. The proposed models are compatible with recent experimental data in overall size, cross-section area, and molecular weight. A general hIAPP aggregation mechanism is proposed on the basis of our simulated models and experimental data.

21161594|t|Activation of amyloid precursor protein processing by growth factors is dependent on Ras GTPase activity.
21161594|a|The beta-amyloid peptide is generated by the proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the action of beta- and gamma-secretase. The mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. Using a cell-based reporter gene assay we analysed the possible signals and pathways that could be involved in APP cleavage. We used the stable cell line HeLa AG that expresses the human APP(695) fused with the yeast transcription factor Gal4. This fusion protein is normally translocated into the plasma membrane and after APP-Gal4 cleavage, the AICD-Gal4 fragment released can activate the transcription of a luciferase reporter gene. Through this reporter system, we demonstrated that Ras GTPase, but not Ral and Rap, could promote APP-Gal4 cleavage. In addition HeLa AG cells stimulated with EGF or PDGF or overexpressing EGFR exhibit increased APP proteolysis in a Ras-dependent way. This process is also dependent on gamma-secretase activity, being abolished by the gamma-secretase inhibitor DAPT.

21162120|t|Small-molecule inhibitors of bone morphogenic protein and activin/nodal signals promote highly efficient neural induction from human pluripotent stem cells.
21162120|a|The balance of bone morphogenic protein (BMP), transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta)/activin/nodal, and Wnt signals regulates the early lineage segregation of human embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Here we demonstrate that a combination of small-molecule inhibitors of BMP (Dorsomorphin) and TGFbeta/activin/nodal (SB431542) signals promotes highly efficient neural induction from both human ESCs and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). The combination of small molecules had effects on both cell survival and purity of neural differentiation, under conditions of stromal (PA6) cell coculture and feeder-free floating aggregation culture, for all seven pluripotent stem cell lines that we studied, including three ESC and four iPSC lines. Small molecule compounds are stable and cost effective, so our findings provide a promising strategy for controlled production of neurons in regenerative medicine.

21162535|t|NMR characterization of a "fibril-ready" state of demetalated wild-type superoxide dismutase.
21162535|a|Demetalated superoxide dismutase (SOD1) is a transient species, fibrillogenic in nature and of biomedical interest. It is a conformationally disordered protein difficult to characterize. We have developed a strategy based on the NMR investigation of a crystalline species characterized by X-ray crystallography and on the comparison of the solid-state-solution-state chemical shifts. The solid-state assignment has been also helpful in assigning the solution spectra. The solution NMR spectra presumably detect species that are the result of equilibria among multiple species. From the differences in chemical shifts between the two forms, we learned that a beta-sheet becomes conformationally labile and two loops in the same sheet show propensity to take a beta conformation. This strategy, which exploits solution and solid-state NMR spectra in a synergistic way, thus provides information on the species that are prone to oligomerize.

21163295|t|The role of NOS in the impairment of spatial memory and damaged neurons in rats injected with amyloid beta 25-35 into the temporal cortex.
21163295|a|The Abeta(25-35) fraction mimics the toxic effects of the complete peptide Abeta(1-42) because this decapeptide is able to cause memory impairment and neurodegenerative events. Recent evidence has shown that the injection of Abeta(25-35) into the temporal cortex (TCx) of the rat increases the nitric oxide (NO) pathways with several consequences, such as neuronal loss in rats. Our aim was to investigate the effects of each NOS isoform by the prior injection of NOS inhibitors before the injection of the Abeta(25-35). One month after the treatment, the animals were tested for their spatial memory in the radial maze. The hippocampus (Hp) and TCx were assessed for NO production, nitration of proteins (3-NT), astrocytosis (GFAP), and neuronal loss. Our findings show a significant impairment in the memory caused by Abeta25-35 injection. In contrast NOS inhibitors plus Abeta25-35 cause a protection yielding a high performance in the memory test and reduction of cell damage in the TCx and the Hp. Particularly, iNOS is the major source of NO and related to the inflammatory response leading to the memory deficits. The inhibition of iNOS is an important target for neuronal protection against the toxicity of the Abeta25-35 over the long term.

21166677|t|Oxidative insults to neurons and synapse are prevented by aged garlic extract and S-allyl-L-cysteine treatment in the neuronal culture and APP-Tg mouse model.
21166677|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common forms of dementia in the elderly. In AD patients, beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are common features observed in the CNS. Abeta deposition results in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to the hyperphosphorylation of tau that are associated with neuronal damage. Cholinesterase inhibitors and a partial NMDA receptor antagonist (memantine) have been identified as potential treatment options for AD. However, clinical studies have found that these drugs fail to prevent the disease progression. From ancient times, garlic (Allium sativum) has been used to treat several diseases. By 'aging' of garlic, some adverse reactions of garlic can be eliminated. Recent findings suggest that 'aged garlic extract' (AGE) may be a therapeutic agent for AD because of its antioxidant and Abeta lowering properties. To date, the molecular properties of AGE have been sparsely studied in vitro or in vivo. The present study tested specific biochemical and molecular effects of AGE in neuronal and AD rodent models. Furthermore, we identified S-allyl-L-cysteine (SAC) as one of the most active chemicals responsible for the AGE-mediated effect(s). We observed significant neuroprotective and neurorescue properties of AGE and one of its ingredients, SAC, from ROS (H(2)O(2))-mediated insults to neuronal cells. Treatment of AGE and SAC were found to protect neuronal cells when they were independently co-treated with ROS. Furthermore, a novel neuropreservation effect of AGE was detected in that pre-treatment with AGE alone protected ~ 80% neuronal cells from ROS-mediated damage. AGE was also found to preserve pre-synaptic protein synaptosomal associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP25) from ROS-mediated insult. For example, treatment with 2% AGE containing diet and SAC (20 mg/kg of diet) independently increased (~70%) levels of SNAP25 and synaptophysin in Alzheimer's amyloid precursor protein-transgenic mice, of which the latter was significantly decreased in AD. Taken together, the neuroprotective, including preservation of pre-synaptic proteins by AGE and SAC can be utilized in future drug development in AD.

21167215|t|The type III TGF-beta receptor betaglycan transmembrane-cytoplasmic domain fragment is stable after ectodomain cleavage and is a substrate of the intramembrane protease gamma-secretase.
21167215|a|The Type III TGF-beta receptor, betaglycan, is a widely expressed proteoglycan co-receptor for TGF-beta superfamily ligands. The full-length protein undergoes ectodomain cleavage with release of a soluble ectodomain fragment. The fate of the resulting transmembrane-cytoplasmic fragment, however, has never been explored. We demonstrate here that the transmembrane-cytoplasmic fragment is stable in transfected cells and in cell lines expressing endogenous betaglycan. Production of this fragment is inhibited by the ectodomain shedding inhibitor TAPI-2. Treatment of cells with inhibitors of the intramembrane protease gamma-secretase stabilizes this fragment, suggesting that it is a substrate of gamma-secretase. Expression of the transmembrane-cytoplasmic fragment as well as gamma-secretase inhibitor stabilization are independent of TGF-beta1 or -beta2 and are unaffected by mutation of the cytoplasmic domain serines that undergo phosphorylation. gamma-Secretase inhibition or the expression of a transmembrane-cytoplasmic fragment in HepG2 cells blunted TGF-beta2 signaling. Our findings thus suggest that the transmembrane-cytoplasmic fragment remaining after betaglycan ectodomain cleavage is stable and a substrate of gamma-secretase, which may have significant implications for the TGF-beta signaling response.

21167219|t|Calmodulin regulates the non-amyloidogenic metabolism of amyloid precursor protein in platelets.
21167219|a|A balance between the proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein APP through the amyloidogenic and the non-amyloidogenic pathways controls the production and release of amyloid beta-protein, whose accumulation in the brain is associated to the onset of Alzheimer Disease. APP is also expressed on circulating platelets. The regulation of APP processing in these cells is poorly understood. In this work we show that platelets store considerable amounts of APP fragments, including sAPPalpha, that can be released upon stimulation of platelets. Moreover, platelet stimulation also promotes the proteolysis of intact APP expressed on the cell surface. This process is supported by an ADAM metalloproteinase, and causes the release of sAPPalpha. Processing of intact platelet APP is promoted also by treatment with calmodulin antagonist W7. W7-induced APP proteolysis occurs through the non-amyloidogenic pathway, is mediated by a metalloproteinase, and causes the release of sAPPalpha. Co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down experiments revealed a physical association between calmodulin and APP. These results document a novel role of calmodulin in the regulation of non-amyloidogenic processing of APP.

21167913|t|Lead exposure increases levels of beta-amyloid in the brain and CSF and inhibits LRP1 expression in APP transgenic mice.
21167913|a|Lead (Pb) is an environmental factor suspected of contributing to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD, it has been postulated that increased production and/or decreased metabolism/clearance of beta-amyloid (Abeta) may lead to amyloid plaque deposition as well as a cascade of other neuropathological changes. It has been suggested that Pb exposure may be associated with AD-like pathology and severe memory deficits in humans. Therefore, we investigated whether Pb exposure could induce Abeta accumulation in the brain. In this study, we demonstrated that acute Pb treatments lead to increased levels of Abeta in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain tissues. Interestingly, Pb treatments did not affect Abeta production in brain neurons. Furthermore, Pb treatments significantly decreased LRP1 protein expression in the choroid plexus (CP). Our results suggest disrupted LRP1-mediated transport of Abeta in this region may be responsible for the Abeta accumulation in brain.

21168467|t|Neuroprotective effects of Eriobotrya japonica against beta-amyloid-induced oxidative stress and memory impairment.
21168467|a|The generation of oxygen free radicals and oxidative damage is believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. Eriobotrya japonica has been used to treat several diseases in East Asia. In this study, we investigated the protective effect of an E. japonica extract against Abeta peptide-induced oxidative stress. The 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay demonstrated that the E. japonica extract scavenged approximately 40% of DPPH radicals. Also, treatment of the E. japonica extract inhibited Abeta(1-42)-mediated neuronal cell death. Furthermore, treatment of E. japonica extract efficiently suppressed the increase in intracellular ROS triggered by the Abeta(1-42) peptide. Importantly, mice pre-treated with the E. japonica extract showed restoration of alternation behavior and reversal of Abeta(1-42)-induced memory impairment. Consequently, the E. japonica extract substantially inhibited the increase in lipid peroxidation and restored superoxide dismutase activity. These results suggest that E. japonica protects from oxidative stress and cognitive deficits induced by the Abeta peptide.

21170538|t|The pathological process underlying Alzheimer's disease in individuals under thirty.
21170538|a|Brains of 42 individuals between the ages of 4 and 29 were examined with antibodies (AT8, 4G8) and silver stains for the presence of intraneuronal and extracellular protein aggregates associated with Alzheimer's disease. Thirty-eight of 42 (38/42) cases displayed abnormally phosphorylated tau protein (pretangle material) in nerve cells or in portions of their cellular processes, and 41/42 individuals showed no extracellular amyloid-beta protein deposition or neuritic plaques-an individual with Down syndrome was the only exception. In 16/42 cases abnormal tau was found in the transentorhinal region, and in 3/42 cases this site was Gallyas-positive for isolated NFTs (NFT stage I). Of 26 cases that lacked abnormal tau in the transentorhinal region, 4 did not show pretangle material at subcortical sites. The remaining 22 of these same 26 cases, however, had subcortical lesions confined to non-thalamic nuclei with diffuse projections to the cerebral cortex, and, remarkably, in 19/22 individuals the pretangle material was confined to the noradrenergic coeruleus/subcoeruleus complex. Assuming the pretangle alterations are not transient and do not regress, these findings may indicate that the Alzheimer's disease-related pathological process leading to neurofibrillary tangle formation does not begin in the cerebral cortex but, rather, in select subcortical nuclei, and it may start quite early, i.e., before puberty or in early young adulthood.

21170561|a|The Co(III) complex of 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane has been employed as the catalytic center of target-selective peptide-cleaving catalysts in previous studies. As new chelating ligands for the Co(III) ion in the peptide-cleaving catalysts, 1-oxo-4,7,10-triazacyclodedecane, 1-aryl-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclodecane, and 7-aryl-1-oxo-4,7,10-triazacyclodecane were examined in the present study. A chemical library comprising 612 derivatives of the Co(III) complex of the new chelating ligands was constructed. The catalyst candidates were tested for their activity to cleave the soluble oligomers of amyloidogenic peptides amyloid beta-42 and human islet amyloid polypeptide (h-IAPP), which are believed to be the pathogenic species for Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus, respectively. One derivative of the Co(III) complex of 1-aryl-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclodecane was found to cleave the oligomers of h-IAPP. Cleavage products were identified and cleavage yields were measured at various catalyst concentrations for the action of the new catalyst. The present results reveal that effective catalytic drugs for amyloidoses may be obtained by using Co(III) complexes of various chelating ligands.

21170692|t|Interactions of Npc1 and amyloid accumulation/deposition in the APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's.
21170692|a|Although Niemann-Pick C1 disease has frequently been called "juvenile Alzheimer's", the effects of introducing Npc1 mutations into a mouse model of Alzheimer's have not previously been performed. We have crossed Npc1 (+/-) mice with APP/PS1 "Alzheimer's" mice and studied Abeta42 accumulation and amyloid plaque formation. Mice heterozygous for Npc1 and positive for the APP and PS1 transgenes accumulated Abeta42 more rapidly than the APP/PS1 controls and this correlated, as expected, with the area of amyloid plaques. We conclude that the alterations of intracellular cholesterol present in Npc1 (+/-) mice can influence the progress of Alzheimer's disease in the APP/PS1 mouse model.

21172309|t|MicroRNA-101 downregulates Alzheimer's amyloid-beta precursor protein levels in human cell cultures and is differentially expressed.
21172309|a|The full repertoire of regulatory interactions utilized by human cells to control expression of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) is still undefined. We investigated here the contribution of microRNA (miRNA) to this regulatory network. Several bioinformatic algorithms predicted miR-101 target sites within the APP 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR). Using reporter assays, we confirmed that, in human cell cultures, miR-101 significantly reduced the expression of a reporter under control of APP 3'-UTR. Mutation of predicted site 1, but not site 2, eliminated this reporter response. Delivery of miR-101 directly to human HeLa cells significantly reduced APP levels and this effect was eliminated by co-transfection with a miR-101 antisense inhibitor. Delivery of a specific target protector designed to blockade the interaction between miR-101 and its functional target site within APP 3'-UTR enhanced APP levels in HeLa. Therefore, endogenous miR-101 regulates expression of APP in human cells via a specific site located within its 3'-UTR. Finally, we demonstrate that, across a series of human cell lines, highest expression of miR-101 levels was observed in model NT2 neurons.

21173986|t|Copper(II) complexes of hybrid hydroxyquinoline-thiosemicarbazone ligands: GSK3beta inhibition due to intracellular delivery of copper.
21173986|a|Cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's disease appears to be related to the hyper-phosphorylation of the protein tau as a consequence of increased activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta), and subsequent formation of neurotoxic neurofibrillary tangles. Abberant metal ion homeostasis, particularly involving copper has been implicitly linked to the pathogenesis of the disease. Increasing intracellular copper concentrations has been found to trigger pathways that result in inhibition of GSK3beta. The syntheses and characterisation of tetradentate hybrid hydroxyquinoline-thiosemicarbazone proligands is presented. The ligands form stable complexes with Cu(II) where the copper ion is four coordinate and essentially square planar as characterised by single crystal X-ray crystallography. The reduction of the metal ion to Cu(I) has been studied by electrochemical techniques and occurs at potentials that permit intracellular reduction. The new complexes show class dependent cell membrane permeability in neuronal-like SH-SY5Y cells with subsequent increases in intracellular copper concentrations. The increased intracellular copper results in a dose-dependent inhibition (phosphorylation) of GSK3beta.

21174134|t|Can molecular dynamics simulations assist in design of specific inhibitors and imaging agents of amyloid aggregation? Structure, stability and free energy predictions for amyloid oligomers of VQIVYK, MVGGVV and LYQLEN.
21174134|a|The aggregation modes of hexapeptide fragments of Tau, Insulin and Abeta peptide (VQIVYK, MVGGVV and LYQLEN) were found from their microcrystalline structures that had been recently resolved by X-ray analysis. The atomic structures reveal a dry self-complementary interface between the neighboring beta-sheet layers, termed "steric zipper". In this study we perform several all-atom molecular dynamics simulations with explicit water to analyze stability of the crystalline fragments of 2-10 hexapeptides each and their analogs with single glycine replacement mutations to investigate the structural stability, aggregation behavior and thermodynamic of the amyloid oligomers. Upon comparing single and double layer models, our results reveal that additional strands contribute significantly to the structural stability of the peptide oligomers for double layer model, while in the case of single layer model the stability decreases (or remains the same in the case of LYQLEN). This is in agreement with the previous studies performed on different types of amyloid models. We also replaced the side-chains participating in the steric zipper interfaces with glycine. None of the mutants were structurally stable compared to the respective wild type model, except for mutants V2G and V6G in MVGGVV2 case. The exception can be explained by structural features of this particular polymorph. The double layer decamer and dodecamer aggregates of the wild type hexapeptides appear to be stable at 300K, which is confirmed by the conservation of high anti-parallel beta-sheet content throughout the whole simulation time. Deletions of the side chains resulted in decline of secondary structure content compared to corresponding wild type indicating that the role of the replaced amino acid in stabilizing the structure. Detailed analysis of the binding energy reveals that stability of these peptide aggregates is determined mainly by the van der Waals and hydrophobic forces that can serve as quantitative measure of shape complementarities between the side chains. This observation implies that interactions among side chains forming the dehydrated steric zipper, rather than among those exposed to water, are the major structural determinant. The electrostatic repulsion destabilizes the studied double layer aggregates in two cases, while stabilizes the other two. Negative total binding free energy indicates that both wild type and mutants complex formation is favorable. However, the mutants complexation is less favorable than the wild type's. The present study provides the atomic level understanding of the aggregation behavior and the driving force for the amyloid aggregates, and could be useful for rational design of amyloid inhibitors and amyloid-specific biomarkers for diagnostic purposes.

21175399|t|Modulation of ABCA1 by an LXR agonist reduces beta-amyloid levels and improves outcome after traumatic brain injury.
21175399|a|Traumatic brain injury (TBI) increases brain beta-amyloid (Abeta) in humans and animals. Although the role of Abeta in the injury cascade is unknown, multiple preclinical studies have demonstrated a correlation between reduced Abeta and improved outcome. Therefore, therapeutic strategies that enhance Abeta clearance may be beneficial after TBI. Increased levels of ATP-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1) transporters can enhance Abeta clearance through an apolipoprotein E (apoE)-mediated pathway. By measuring Abeta and ABCA1 after experimental TBI in C57BL/6J mice, we found that Abeta peaked early after injury (1-3 days), whereas ABCA1 had a delayed response (beginning at 3 days). As ABCA1 levels increased, Abeta levels returned to baseline levels-consistent with the known role of ABCA1 in Abeta clearance. To test if enhancing ABCA1 levels could block TBI-induced Abeta, we treated TBI mice with the liver X-receptor (LXR) agonist T0901317. Pre- and post-injury treatment increased ABCA1 levels at 24 h post-injury, and reduced the TBI-induced increase in Abeta. This reduction in Abeta was not due to decreased amyloid precursor protein processing, or a shift in the solubility of Abeta, indicating enhanced clearance. T0901317 also limited motor coordination deficits in injured mice and reduced brain lesion volume. These data indicate that activation of LXR can reduce Abeta accumulation after TBI, and is accompanied by improved functional recovery.

21177248|t|Lipoprotein lipase is a novel amyloid beta (Abeta)-binding protein that promotes glycosaminoglycan-dependent cellular uptake of Abeta in astrocytes.
21177248|a|Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a member of a lipase family known to hydrolyze triglyceride molecules in plasma lipoprotein particles. LPL also plays a role in the binding of lipoprotein particles to cell-surface molecules, including sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). LPL is predominantly expressed in adipose and muscle but is also highly expressed in the brain where its specific roles are unknown. It has been shown that LPL is colocalized with senile plaques in Alzheimer disease (AD) brains, and its mutations are associated with the severity of AD pathophysiological features. In this study, we identified a novel function of LPL; that is, LPL binds to amyloid beta protein (Abeta) and promotes cell-surface association and uptake of Abeta in mouse primary astrocytes. The internalized Abeta was degraded within 12 h, mainly in a lysosomal pathway. We also found that sulfated GAGs were involved in the LPL-mediated cellular uptake of Abeta. Apolipoprotein E was dispensable in the LPL-mediated uptake of Abeta. Our findings indicate that LPL is a novel Abeta-binding protein promoting cellular uptake and subsequent degradation of Abeta.

21182336|t|Fluoroalcohol-induced modulation of the pathway of amyloid protofibril formation by barstar.
21182336|a|To understand how the conformational heterogeneity of protofibrils formed by any protein, as well as the mechanisms of their formation, are modulated by a change in aggregation conditions, we studied the formation of amyloid protofibrils by barstar at low pH by multiple structural probes in the presence of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP). In the presence of 10% HFIP, aggregation proceeds with the transient formation of spherical oligomers and leads to the formation of both protofibrils and fibrils. Curly short protofibrils and fibrils are seen to form early during the aggregation reaction, and both are seen to grow gradually in length during the course of the reaction. Atomic force microscopy images reveal that the HFIP-induced protofibrils are long (~300 nm in length), curly, and beaded and appear to be composed primarily of beta-sheet bilayers, with heights of ~2.4 nm. The protofibrils formed in the presence of HFIP differ in both their structures and their stabilities from the protofibrils formed either in the absence of alcohol or in the presence of a related alcohol, trifluoroethanol (TFE). Aggregation appears to proceed via an isodesmic polymerization mechanism. Internal structure in the growing aggregates changes in two stages during protofibril formation. In the first stage, an alpha-helix-rich oligomeric intermediate is formed. In the second stage, the level of beta-sheet structure increases at the expense of some alpha-helical structure. The second stage itself appears to occur in two distinct steps. The creation of thioflavin T binding sites occurs concomitantly with aggregate elongation and is seen to precede the change in secondary structure. The long straight fibrils with characteristic heights of 8-10 nm, which form in the course of the HFIP-induced aggregation reaction, have not been observed to form either in the absence of alcohol or in the presence of TFE.

Here, we demonstrate with pharmacological tools or siRNA that O-GlcNAcase and O-GlcNAc transferase regulate the level of O-GlcNAcylated APP. We also show that O-GlcNAcylation increases non-amyloidogenic alpha-secretase processing, resulting in increased levels of the neuroprotective sAPPalpha fragment and decreased Abeta secretion. Our results implicate O-GlcNAcylation as a potential therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease.

To address the roles of fatty acid unsaturation numbers in cellular pathways of Alzheimer's disease (AD), we systematically investigated the effects of fatty acids on cell membrane fluidity and alpha-secretase-cleaved soluble amyloid precursor protein (sAPP(alpha)) secretion in relation to unsaturation numbers using stearic acid (SA, 18:0), oleic acid (OA, 18:1), linoleic acid (LA, 18:2), alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3), arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6). Treatments of differentiated human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y cells) with AA, EPA and DHA for 24h increased sAPP(alpha) secretion and membrane fluidity, whereas those treatments with SA, OA, LA and ALA did not. Treatments with AA and DHA did not alter the total expressions of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and alpha-secretases in SH-SY5Y cells. These results suggested that not all unsaturated fatty acids but only those with 4 or more double bonds, such as AA, EPA and DHA, are able to increase membrane fluidity and lead to increase in sAPP(alpha) secretion. This study provides insights into dietary strategies for the prevention of AD.

21185302|t|High-affinity amphipathic modulators of amyloid fibril nucleation and elongation.
21185302|a|The misfolding and aggregation of proteins to form amyloid fibrils are associated with a number of debilitating, age-related diseases. Many of the proteins that form amyloid in vivo are lipid-binding proteins, accounting for the significant impact of lipids on the rate of formation and morphology of amyloid fibrils. To systematically investigate the effect of lipid-like compounds, we screened a range of amphipathic lipids and detergents for their effect on amyloid fibril formation by human apolipoprotein (apo) C-II. The initial screen, conducted using a set of amphiphiles at half critical micelle concentration, identified several activators and inhibitors that were selected for further analysis. Sedimentation analysis and circular dichroism studies of apoC-II at low, non-fibril-forming concentrations (0.05 mg/ml) revealed that all of the inhibitors induced the formation of apoC-II dimers enriched in alpha-helical content while the activators promoted the formation of stable apoC-II tetramers with increased beta-structure. Kinetic analysis identified modulators of apoC-II fibril formation that were effective at concentrations as low as 10 muM, corresponding to a modulator-to-apoC-II ratio of approximately 1:10. Delayed addition of the test compounds after fibril formation had commenced allowed the effects of selected amphiphiles on fibril elongation to be determined separately from their effects on fibril nucleation. The results indicated that specific amphiphiles induce structural changes in apoC-II that cause separate and independent effects on fibril nucleation and elongation. Low-molecular-weight amphipathic lipids and detergents may serve as useful, stage-specific modulators of protein self-assembly and fibril formation in disease-prevention strategies.

21186130|t|Analysis of the stabilities of hexameric amyloid-beta(1-42) models using discrete molecular dynamics simulations.
21186130|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers appear to play a pivotal role in Alzheimer's disease. A 42 residue long alloform, Abeta42, is closely related to etiology of the disease. In vitro results show evidences of hexamers; however structures of these hexamers have not been resolved experimentally. Here, we use discrete molecular dynamics (DMD) to analyze long duration stabilities of Abeta42 hexamer models developed previously in our lab. The hydrophobic core of these models is a six-stranded beta-barrel with 3-fold radial symmetry formed by residues 30-40. This core is shielded from water by residues 1-28. The nine models we analyzed differ by the relative positions of the core beta-strands, and whether the other segments surrounding the core contain alpha helices or beta-strands. A model of an annular protofibril composed of 36 Abeta peptides was also simulated. Results of these model simulations were compared with results of aggregation simulations that started from six well separated random coils of Abeta42 and with simulations of two known beta-barrel structures. These results can be categorized into three groups: stable models with properties similar or superior to those of experimentally determined beta-barrel proteins, aggregation-prone models, and an amorphous aggregate from random coils. Conformations at the end of the simulation for aggregation-prone models have exposed hydrophobic core with dangling beta-strands on the surface. Hydrogen bond patterns within the beta-barrel were a critical factor for stability of the beta-barrel models. Aggregation-prone conformations imply that the association of these hexamers may be possible, which could lead to the formation of larger assemblies.

21186265|t|Reversal of autophagy dysfunction in the TgCRND8 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease ameliorates amyloid pathologies and memory deficits.
21186265|a|Autophagy, a major degradative pathway for proteins and organelles, is essential for survival of mature neurons. Extensive autophagic-lysosomal pathology in Alzheimer's disease brain contributes to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, although the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we identified and characterized marked intraneuronal amyloid-beta peptide/amyloid and lysosomal system pathology in the Alzheimer's disease mouse model TgCRND8 similar to that previously described in Alzheimer's disease brains. We further establish that the basis for these pathologies involves defective proteolytic clearance of neuronal autophagic substrates including amyloid-beta peptide. To establish the pathogenic significance of these abnormalities, we enhanced lysosomal cathepsin activities and rates of autophagic protein turnover in TgCRND8 mice by genetically deleting cystatin B, an endogenous inhibitor of lysosomal cysteine proteases. Cystatin B deletion rescued autophagic-lysosomal pathology, reduced abnormal accumulations of amyloid-beta peptide, ubiquitinated proteins and other autophagic substrates within autolysosomes/lysosomes and reduced intraneuronal amyloid-beta peptide. The amelioration of lysosomal function in TgCRND8 markedly decreased extracellular amyloid deposition and total brain amyloid-beta peptide 40 and 42 levels, and prevented the development of deficits of learning and memory in fear conditioning and olfactory habituation tests. Our findings support the pathogenic significance of autophagic-lysosomal dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease and indicate the potential value of restoring normal autophagy as an innovative therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease.

21186781|t|The amyloid precursor protein C-terminal fragment C100 occurs in monomeric and dimeric stable conformations and binds gamma-secretase modulators.
21186781|a|The amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide is contained within the C-terminal fragment (beta-CTF) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and is intimately linked to Alzheimer's disease. In vivo, Abeta is generated by sequential cleavage of beta-CTF within the gamma-secretase module. To investigate gamma-secretase function, in vitro assays are in widespread use which require a recombinant beta-CTF substrate expressed in bacteria and purified from inclusion bodies, termed C100. So far, little is known about the conformation of C100 under different conditions of purification and refolding. Since C100 dimerization influences the efficiency and specificity of gamma-secretase cleavage, it is also of great interest to determine the secondary structure and the oligomeric state of the synthetic substrate as well as the binding properties of small molecules named gamma-secretase modulators (GSMs) which we could previously show to modulate APP transmembrane sequence interactions [Richter et al. (2010) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 107, 14597-14602]. Here, we use circular dichroism and continuous-wave electron spin resonance measurements to show that C100 purified in a buffer containing SDS at micelle-forming concentrations adopts a highly stable alpha-helical conformation, in which it shows little tendency to aggregate or to form higher oligomers than dimers. By surface plasmon resonance analysis and molecular modeling we show that the GSM sulindac sulfide binds to C100 and has a preference for C100 dimers.

21186801|t|Effects of G33A and G33I mutations on the structures of monomer and dimer of the amyloid-beta fragment 29-42 by replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations.
21186801|a|The early formed oligomers of amyloid-beta proteins with 40 and 42 amino acids are believed to be the culprits of Alzheimer's disease. Abeta1-42 peptides with alanine and isoleucine mutations of glycine 33 are known to be much less toxic than the wild-type Abeta1-42 and promote the aggregation process in vitro. The fragment Abeta29-42 has also been shown to form fibrils, disrupt Abeta1-42 oligomerization, and inhibit Abeta1-42-induced neurotoxicity. As a first step toward understanding the impact of G33A and G33I mutations on the earliest steps along the Abeta1-42 aggregation pathway, we have studied the structures of the monomer and dimer of Abeta29-42 and its two G33 variants using coarse-grained replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations. These simulations, totaling 15 mus, indicate that both substitutions impact the conformational ensemble of Abeta29-42. For the monomer, the population of the beta-hairpin is high for wild-type Abeta29-42, but marginal for Abeta29-42 G33I mutant. The three dimers are also stabilized by different patterns of interaction. The data are discussed in terms of the differences in the aggregation characteristics between wild-type Abeta1-42 and its two G33A and G33I variants.

21190670|t|Stoichiometry and affinity of the human serum albumin-Alzheimer's Abeta peptide interactions.
21190670|a|A promising strategy to control the aggregation of the Alzheimer's Abeta peptide in the brain is the clearance of Abeta from the central nervous system into the peripheral blood plasma. Among plasma proteins, human serum albumin plays a critical role in the Abeta clearance to the peripheral sink by binding to Abeta oligomers and preventing further growth into fibrils. However, the stoichiometry and the affinities of the albumin-Abeta oligomer interactions are still to be fully characterized. For this purpose, here we investigate the Abeta oligomer-albumin complexes through a novel and generally applicable experimental strategy combining saturation transfer and off-resonance relaxation NMR experiments with ultrafiltration, domain deletions, and dynamic light scattering. Our results show that the Abeta oligomers are recognized by albumin through sites that are evenly partitioned across the three albumin domains and that bind the Abeta oligomers with similar dissociation constants in the 1-100 nM range, as assessed based on a Scatchard-like model of the albumin inhibition isotherms. Our data not only explain why albumin is able to inhibit amyloid formation at physiological nM Abeta concentrations, but are also consistent with the presence of a single high affinity albumin-binding site per Abeta protofibril, which avoids the formation of extended insoluble aggregates.

21192698|t|Interactions of Abeta25-35 beta-barrel-like oligomers with anionic lipid bilayer and resulting membrane leakage: an all-atom molecular dynamics study.
21192698|a|Abeta25-35, a proteolytic fragment of the Alzheimer amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide, is produced in the brains of Alzheimer's patients and retains the neurotoxicity of its full-length counterpart. The formation of pores/channels in membranes has been reported as one of the mechanisms responsible for Abeta25-35 toxicity. In addition, it has been proposed that pore/channel might be formed by the aggregation of Abeta25-35 in membranes into a beta-barrel structure. However, the structure of the beta-barrel and its perturbation on the ordering of lipid bilayer at atomic level remain elusive. In this study, we have investigated the interactions of three types of preformed Abeta25-35 beta-barrels (labeled as barrels A, B, and C) with negatively charged palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylglycerol (POPG) lipid bilayers using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Each type of Abeta25-35 beta-barrel consists of eight beta-strands with positively charged side chains of lysine residues oriented toward the interior or exterior of the barrel. Barrels A, B, and C have respectively an out-of-register mixed parallel-antiparallel (taken from our previous study), in-register mixed parallel-antiparallel, and in-register antiparallel beta-strand arrangements. Simulations have been performed by employing the initial configurations where the beta-barrels are fully or partially inserted into the bilayer. On the basis of nine independent 150 ns MD runs for the full-insertion system, we found that barrels A and C slightly affect the local ordering of lipid bilayer, while barrel B perturbs the local structure of membrane and even causes membrane leakage for water by forming nanometer-sized hydrophilic pore when lysine residues on its inner side. Two 100 ns MD simulations on partial-insertion system show that partial insertion of Abeta25-35 beta-barrel in the bilayer results in a tendency to stay inside for barrel B. These results suggest that barrel B with Lys residues on its inner side is the most likely Abeta25-35 pore structure leading to membrane leakage. Our MD simulations provide significant insight into the atomic resolution structure of Abeta25-35 beta-sheet-rich pores and the membrane disruption mechanism induced by Abeta25-35 amyloid pores.

21192984|t|Treadmill exercise prevents decline in spatial learning and memory in APP/PS1 transgenic mice through improvement of hippocampal long-term potentiation.
21192984|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease clinically characterized by learning and memory function deterioration. While it is well established that exercise can improve cognitive performance in AD, there have been few basic cellular and molecular mechanisms research performed to test the interaction between exercise and AD. In this study, we aimed at investigating whether treadmill exercise improves learning and memory function in APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease by enhancing long-term potentiation (LTP) and up-regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA expression. Our results show that, in comparison to wild type mice, transgenic mice were characterized by impaired learning and memory function, LTP deficits and increased BDNF mRNA levels. Treadmill exercise enhanced learning and memory function not only in wild type mice but also in APP/PS1 mice paralleled by LTP. However, BDNF has emerged as a crucial regulator of synaptic plasticity mechanisms underlying learning and memory in wild-type mice, but not in APP/PS1 mice. Hence, this investigation demonstrates that treadmill exercise is an effective therapeutic that alleviate learning and memory decline in APP/PS1 mouse model, and enhanced LTP maybe a cellular mechanism involved in neuropathological course of AD and cognitive improvement induced by exercise.

21195782|t|Inter-rater reliability of manual and automated region-of-interest delineation for PiB PET.
21195782|a|A major challenge in positron emission tomography (PET) amyloid imaging studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the reliable detection of early amyloid deposition in human brain. Manual region-of-interest (ROI) delineation on structural magnetic resonance (MR) images is generally the reference standard for the extraction of count-rate data from PET images, as compared to automated MR-template(s) methods that utilize spatial normalization and a single set of ROIs. The goal of this work was to assess the inter-rater reliability of manual ROI delineation for PiB PET amyloid retention measures and the impact of CSF dilution correction (CSF) on this reliability for data acquired in elderly control (n=5) and AD (n=5) subjects. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to measure reliability. As a secondary goal, ICC scores were also computed for PiB outcome measures obtained by an automated MR-template ROI method and one manual rater; to assess the level of reliability that could be achieved using different processing methods. Fourteen ROIs were evaluated that included anterior cingulate (ACG), precuneus (PRC) and cerebellum (CER). The PiB outcome measures were the volume of distribution (V(T)), summed tissue uptake (SUV), and corresponding ratios that were computed using CER as reference (DVR and SUVR). Substantial reliability (ICC>=0.932) was obtained across 3 manual raters for V(T) and SUV measures when CSF correction was applied across all outcomes and regions and was similar in the absence of CSF correction. The secondary analysis revealed substantial reliability in primary cortical areas between the automated and manual SUV [ICC>=0.979 (ACG/PRC)] and SUVR [ICC>=0.977/0.952 (ACG/PRC)] outcomes. The current study indicates the following rank order among the various reliability results in primary cortical areas and cerebellum (high to low): 1) V(T) or SUV manual delineation, with or without CSF correction; 2) DVR or SUVR manual delineation, with or without CSF correction; 3) SUV automated delineation, with CSF correction; and 4) SUVR automated delineation, with or without CSF correction. The high inter-rater reliability of PiB outcome measures in primary cortical areas (ACG/PRC) is important as reliable methodology is needed for the detection of low levels of amyloid deposition on a cross-sectional basis and small changes in amyloid deposition on a longitudinal basis.

21196064|t|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing genes and cerebrospinal fluid APP cleavage product levels in Alzheimer's disease.
21196064|a|The aim of this exploratory investigation was to determine if genetic variation within amyloid precursor protein (APP) or its processing enzymes correlates with APP cleavage product levels: APPalpha, APPbeta or Abeta42, in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of cognitively normal subjects or Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Cognitively normal control subjects (n = 170) and AD patients (n = 92) were genotyped for 19 putative regulatory tagging SNPs within 9 genes (APP, ADAM10, BACE1, BACE2, PSEN1, PSEN2, PEN2, NCSTN and APH1B) involved in the APP processing pathway. SNP genotypes were tested for their association with CSF APPalpha, APPbeta, and Abeta42, AD risk and age-at-onset while taking into account age, gender, race and APOE epsilon4. After adjusting for multiple comparisons, a significant association was found between ADAM10 SNP rs514049 and APPalpha levels. In controls, the rs514049 CC genotype had higher APPalpha levels than the CA, AA collapsed genotype, whereas the opposite effect was seen in AD patients. These results suggest that genetic variation within ADAM10, an APP processing gene, influences CSF APPalpha levels in an AD specific manner.

21204788|t|AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a tau kinase, activated in response to amyloid beta-peptide exposure.
21204788|a|Hyperphosphorylation of tau is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies. Although the mechanisms underlying hyperphosphorylation are not fully understood, cellular stresses such as impaired energy metabolism are thought to influence the signalling cascade. The AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase)-related kinases MARK (microtubule-associated protein-regulating kinase/microtubule affinity-regulating kinase) and BRSK (brain-specific kinase) have been implicated in tau phosphorylation, but are insensitive to activation by cellular stress. In the present study, we show that AMPK itself phosphorylates tau on a number of sites, including Ser262 and Ser396, altering microtubule binding of tau. In primary mouse cortical neurons, CaMKKbeta (Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase beta) activation of AMPK in response to Abeta (amyloid-beta peptide)-(1-42) leads to increased phosphorylation of tau at Ser262/Ser356 and Ser3396. Activation of AMPK by Abeta-(1-42) is inhibited by memantine, a partial antagonist of the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor and currently licensed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. These findings identify a pathway in which Abeta-(1-42) activates CaMKKbeta and AMPK via the NMDA receptor, suggesting the possibility that AMPK plays a role in the pathophysiological phosphorylation of tau.

21205198|t|Lysophosphatidylcholine modulates fibril formation of amyloid beta peptide.
21205198|a|Phospholipids are known to influence fibril formation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide. Here, we show that lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), a polar phospholipid, enhances Abeta(1-42) fibril formation, by decreasing the lag time and the critical peptide concentration required for fibril formation, and increasing the fibril elongation rate. Conversely, LPC did not have an enhancing effect on Abeta(1-40) fibril formation, and appeared to be inhibitory. Tyrosine fluorescence spectroscopy showed that LPC altered the fluorescence spectra of Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) in opposite ways. Further, 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid fluorescence spectroscopy showed that LPC significantly increased the hydrophobicity of Abeta(1-42), but not of Abeta(1-40). Tris-tricine gradient SDS/PAGE revealed that LPC increased the formation of higher-molecular-weight species of Abeta(1-42), including trimers and tetramers. LPC had no such effect on Abeta(1-40), and thus may specifically influence the oligomerization and nucleation processes of Abeta(1-42) in a manner dependent on its native structure. Dot-blot assays confirmed that LPC induced Abeta(1-42) oligomer formation at an early time point. Thus our results indicate that LPC specifically enhances the formation of Abeta(1-42) fibrils, the main component of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease patients, and may be involved in Alzheimer's disease pathology.

21205217|t|Genistein and folic acid prevent oxidative injury induced by beta-amyloid peptide.
21205217|a|To explore the mechanism(s) of the neuroprotective effects of genistein (GEN) and folic acid (FA) on neurons treated with beta amyloid 31-35 (Abeta31-35), the primary cultured cortical neurons were treated with GEN and/or FA for 2 hr prior to exposure to Abeta31-35. Cell viability and fluidity of cell membrane were measured by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2]-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide and fluorescence polarization, respectively. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca(2+) concentrations were measured by laser scanning confocal microscope. Glutataione (GSH) and Glutathione disulfide (GSSG) in mitochondria were measured by enzymatic method. Flow cytometry technique was used to measure mitochondrial membrane potential. The expression of HCY-2 and p38-MAPK mRNA in neurons was analysed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The results showed that GEN and/or FA increased cell viability and reduced concentration of Ca(2+) and generation of ROS in neurons compared with Abeta31-35-treated cells. Furthermore, the ratio of GSH/GSSG in mitochondria and mitochondrial membrane potential was increased after GEN and/or FA treatment. RT-PCR results showed that GEN and/or FA down-regulated expression of HCY-2 and p38-MAPK mRNA. We conclude that GEN and/or FA had neuroprotective effects in Abeta31-35-treated neurons. The mechanisms might be associated with multiple factors such as maintaining redox balance, stabilizing mitochondrial membrane integrity and modulating the signal pathways related to oxidation and apoptosis.

21205781|t|Alzheimer's dementia begins as a disease of small blood vessels, damaged by oxidative-induced inflammation and dysregulated amyloid metabolism: implications for early detection and therapy.
21205781|a|There is a widely shared view among Alzheimer's disease (AD) investigators that the amyloid hypothesis best describes the pathogenic cascade that leads, ultimately, to neuronal degeneration and irreversible dementia. The most persuasive evidence comes from studies of damaged brains of patients in the late stages of AD and from animal studies that attempt to mimic the hereditary forms of early-onset dementia. Despite this impressive body of knowledge, we still lack the means to either arrest or prevent this horrible contagion. This essay attempts to describe what we know, and do not know, about the earliest stages of the disease, focusing on the possibility that the initial pathological changes involve oxidative-induced inflammatory damage to small blood vessels. The resulting ischemia activates amyloid-processing enzymes and other proinflammatory factors that eventually compromise neuronal functions, leading, over time, to the complex lesions that characterize advanced disease. The idea that blood vessel damage is primary has a long history and many prior advocates. The novel addition offered here is the speculation that low-abundance, gain-of-function somatic mutations of the amyloid precursor protein may be part of the triggering mechanism.

21209058|t|Folding stability of amyloid-beta 40 monomer is an important determinant of the nucleation kinetics in fibrillization.
21209058|a|Amyloid formation is initiated by protein misfolding, followed by self-association to ultimately form amyloid fibrils. The discovery of toxic prefibrillar oligomers in many amyloidosis underscores the importance of understanding the folding mechanism prior to such aggregation. Here, we investigated the folding properties of the natively unfolded amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide and the familial variants (A21G, E22Q, E22G, E22K, and D23N) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In combinations of native electrophoresis, analytical ultracentrifugation, fluorescence emission, and far-UV circular dichroism, we showed that all Abeta40 variants are predominantly monomeric with similar residual secondary structures, but distinct hydrophobic-exposed protein surfaces. Guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) denaturation in the absence and presence of trifluoroethanol (TFE) showed that Abeta variants adopt an apparent 2-state equilibrium model with different stabilities, in which wild type is less stable than A21G but more stable than D23N and E22 mutants. By correlating the folding stability with the nucleation phase in fibrillization, we found the more stable the variant, the slower the nucleation, except for D23N. Besides, the unfolding of Abeta conformation leads to reduced formation of mature fibrils, but an increase in nonfibrillar, amorphous type of aggregates. Overall, we demonstrated that folding stability of Abeta is an important determinant of the nucleation kinetics.

21210284|t|Amyloid-beta protein modulates the perivascular clearance of neuronal apolipoprotein E in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.
21210284|a|The deposition of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) in the brain is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is involved in the clearance of Abeta from brain and the APOE epsilon4 allele is a major risk factor for sporadic AD. We have recently shown that apoE is drained into the perivascular space (PVS), where it co-localizes with Abeta. To further clarify the role of apoE in perivascular clearance of Abeta, we studied apoE-transgenic mice over-expressing human apoE4 either in astrocytes (GE4) or in neurons (TE4). These animals were crossbred with amyloid precursor protein (APP)-transgenic mice and with APP-presenilin-1 (APP-PS1) double transgenic mice. Using an antibody that specifically detects human apoE (h-apoE), we observed that astroglial expression of h-apoE in GE4 mice leads to its perivascular drainage, whereas neuronal expression in TE4 mice does not, indicating that neuron-derived apoE is usually not the subject of perivascular drainage. However, h-apoE was observed not only in the PVS of APP-GE4 and APP-PS1-GE4 mice, but also in that of APP-TE4 and APP-PS1-TE4 mice. In all these mouse lines, we found co-localization of neuron-derived h-apoE and Abeta in the PVS. Abeta and h-apoE were also found in the cytoplasm of perivascular astrocytes indicating that astrocytes take up the neuron-derived apoE bound to Abeta, presumably prior to its clearance into the PVS. The uptake of apoE-Abeta complexes into glial cells was further investigated in glioblastoma cells. It was mediated by alpha(2)macroglobulin receptor/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP-1) and inhibited by adding receptor-associated protein (RAP). It results in endosomal Abeta accumulation within these cells. These results suggest that neuronal apoE-Abeta complexes, but not neuronal apoE alone, are substrates for LRP-1-mediated astroglial uptake, transcytosis, and subsequent perivascular drainage. Thus, the production of Abeta and its interaction with apoE lead to the pathological perivascular drainage of neuronal apoE and provide insight into the pathological interactions of Abeta with neuronal apoE metabolism.

21210287|t|Different CSF beta-amyloid processing in Alzheimer's and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
21210287|a|Decreased levels of beta-amyloid (Abeta) 1-42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are characteristic for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and are also evident in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Abeta plaques are thought to be responsible for this decrease in AD patients, whereas such Abeta plaques are rarely seen in CJD. To investigate the Abeta pattern in brain and CSF of neuropathologically confirmed CJD and AD patients we used an electrophoretic method to investigate Abeta peptide fractions which are not accessible to ELISA and immunohistochemistry. We analyzed Abeta peptides in the CSF of autopsy-confirmed CJD and AD patients and the corresponding brain homogenates using a quantitative urea-based Abeta electrophoresis immunoblot (Abeta-SDS-PAGE/immunoblot).The CSF Abeta1-42 decrease correlated with the brain Abeta load in AD, but not in CJD. There was no difference in the soluble fractions of brain homogenate in AD and CJD. We therefore conclude that different mechanisms in AD and CJD are responsible for the Abeta1-42 decrease in the CSF.

21211982|t|Design, synthesis and evaluation of novel tacrine-multialkoxybenzene hybrids as dual inhibitors for cholinesterases and amyloid beta aggregation.
21211982|a|A new series of tacrine-multialkoxybenzene hybrids (9a-9n) were designed, synthesized and evaluated as dual inhibitors of cholinesterases (ChEs) and self-induced beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregation. All the synthesized compounds had high acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibitory activity with IC50 values at the nanomolar range, which were much better than tacrine alone. A Lineweaver-Burk plot and molecular modeling study showed that these hybrids targeted both the catalytic active site (CAS) and the peripheral anionic site (PAS) of AChE. Besides, compounds 9a-9f with methylenedioxybenzene moiety showed higher self-induced Abeta aggregation inhibitory activity than a reference compound, curcumin. These compounds could be selected as multi-potent agents for further investigation to treat AD.

21212395|t|Microinfarct pathology, dementia, and cognitive systems.
21212395|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Little is known about the role of microinfarcts in dementia and cognition. We examined microinfarcts and dementia, global cognition, and 5 cognitive systems in community-dwelling older persons. METHODS: Four hundred twenty-five subjects enrolled in the Religious Orders Study underwent annual clinical evaluations, including 19 neuropsychological tests and assessment for dementia, and brain autopsy (39% men; mean age at death, 87; Mini-Mental State Examination score, 21). Neuropathologic examination documented the presence, number, and location of chronic microinfarcts on 6-mum hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections from cortical and subcortical regions. Multiple regression analyses adjusted for age at death, sex, education, macroscopic infarcts, Alzheimer disease pathology, and Lewy bodies. RESULTS: Microinfarcts were present in 129 of 425 (30%) persons (54 cortical, 80 subcortical, 49 multiple); 58 of 129 (45%) of persons with microinfarcts did not exhibit macroscopic infarcts. Persons with microinfarcts had increased odds of dementia (OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.07-2.92), especially those persons with multiple cortical microinfarcts. Microinfarcts were also associated with lower average global cognition (estimate, -0.287; SE, 0.113; P=0.012), particularly for persons with multiple cortical microinfarcts. Microinfarcts were specifically associated with lower episodic memory (estimate, -0.279; SE, 0.138; P=0.044), semantic memory (estimate, -0.391; SE, 0.130; P=0.003), and perceptual speed (estimate, -0.400; SE, 0.117; P<0.001). In addition, single, multiple, and cortical microinfarcts were associated with worse semantic memory and perceptual speed (all P<0.028). Neither macroscopic infarcts nor AD pathology modified these associations (all P>0.154). CONCLUSIONS: Microinfarcts are common, and persons with multiple cortical microinfarcts have higher odds of dementia. Microinfarcts are also associated with lower cognition, specifically perceptual speed and semantic and episodic memory.

21214263|t|Defining the pathway of worm-like amyloid fibril formation by the mouse prion protein by delineation of the productive and unproductive oligomerization reactions.
21214263|a|Aggregation reactions of proteins leading to amyloid fibril formation are often characterized by early transient accumulation of a heterogeneous population of soluble oligomers differing in size and structure. Delineating the kinetic roles of the different oligomeric forms in fibril formation has been a major challenge. The aggregation of the mouse prion protein to form worm-like amyloid fibrils at low pH is known to proceed via a beta-rich oligomer ensemble, which is shown here to be comprised of two subpopulations of oligomers that differ in size and internal structure. The relative populations of the two oligomers can be tuned by varying the concentration of NaCl present. By demonstrating that the apparent rate constant for the formation of fibrils is dependent linearly on the concentration of the larger oligomer and is independent of the concentration of the smaller oligomer, we show that the larger oligomer is a productive intermediate that accumulates on the direct pathway of aggregation from monomer to worm-like fibrils. The smaller oligomer is shown to be populated off the pathway of the larger oligomer and, hence, is not directly productive for fibril formation. The relative populations of the two oligomers can also be tuned by single-amino acid residue changes in the sequence of the protein. The different protein variants yield worm-like fibrils of different lengths, and the apparent rate of formation of the fibrils by the mutant variants is also shown to be dependent on the concentration of the larger but not of the smaller oligomer formed.

21214572|t|Plasmalogen synthesis is regulated via alkyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate-synthase by amyloid precursor protein processing and is affected in Alzheimer's disease.
21214572|a|Lipids play an important role as risk or protective factors in Alzheimer's disease, which is characterized by amyloid plaques composed of aggregated amyloid-beta. Plasmalogens are major brain lipids and controversially discussed to be altered in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and whether changes in plasmalogens are cause or consequence of AD pathology. Here, we reveal a new physiological function of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) in plasmalogen metabolism. The APP intracellular domain was found in vivo and in vitro to increase the expression of the alkyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate-synthase (AGPS), a rate limiting enzyme in plasmalogen synthesis. Alterations in APP dependent changes of AGPS expression result in reduced protein and plasmalogen levels. Under the pathological situation of AD, increased amyloid-beta level lead to increased reactive oxidative species production, reduced AGPS protein and plasmalogen level. Accordingly, phosphatidylethanol plasmalogen was decreased in the frontal cortex of AD compared to age matched controls. Our findings elucidate that plasmalogens are decreased as a consequence of AD and regulated by APP processing under physiological conditions.

21215370|t|Amyloid-like aggregates sequester numerous metastable proteins with essential cellular functions.
21215370|a|Protein aggregation is linked with neurodegeneration and numerous other diseases by mechanisms that are not well understood. Here, we have analyzed the gain-of-function toxicity of artificial beta sheet proteins that were designed to form amyloid-like fibrils. Using quantitative proteomics, we found that the toxicity of these proteins in human cells correlates with the capacity of their aggregates to promote aberrant protein interactions and to deregulate the cytosolic stress response. The endogenous proteins that are sequestered by the aggregates share distinct physicochemical properties: They are relatively large in size and significantly enriched in predicted unstructured regions, features that are strongly linked with multifunctionality. Many of the interacting proteins occupy essential hub positions in cellular protein networks, with key roles in chromatin organization, transcription, translation, maintenance of cell architecture and protein quality control. We suggest that amyloidogenic aggregation targets a metastable subproteome, thereby causing multifactorial toxicity and, eventually, the collapse of essential cellular functions.

21215373|t|Presenilin-dependent receptor processing is required for axon guidance.
21215373|a|The Alzheimer's disease-linked gene presenilin is required for intramembrane proteolysis of amyloid-beta precursor protein, contributing to the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration that is characterized by loss of neuronal connections, but the role of Presenilin in establishing neuronal connections is less clear. Through a forward genetic screen in mice for recessive genes affecting motor neurons, we identified the Columbus allele, which disrupts motor axon projections from the spinal cord. We mapped this mutation to the Presenilin-1 gene. Motor neurons and commissural interneurons in Columbus mutants lacking Presenilin-1 acquire an inappropriate attraction to Netrin produced by the floor plate because of an accumulation of DCC receptor fragments within the membrane that are insensitive to Slit/Robo silencing. Our findings reveal that Presenilin-dependent DCC receptor processing coordinates the interplay between Netrin/DCC and Slit/Robo signaling. Thus, Presenilin is a key neural circuit builder that gates the spatiotemporal pattern of guidance signaling, thereby ensuring neural projections occur with high fidelity.

21215375|t|Identification of candidate IgG biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease via combinatorial library screening.
21215375|a|The adaptive immune system is thought to be a rich source of protein biomarkers, but diagnostically useful antibodies remain unknown for a large number of diseases. This is, in part, because the antigens that trigger an immune response in many diseases remain unknown. We present here a general and unbiased approach to the identification of diagnostically useful antibodies that avoids the requirement for antigen identification. This method involves the comparative screening of combinatorial libraries of unnatural, synthetic molecules against serum samples obtained from cases and controls. Molecules that retain far more IgG antibodies from the case samples than the controls are identified and subsequently tested as capture agents for diagnostically useful antibodies. The utility of this method is demonstrated using a mouse model for multiple sclerosis and via the identification of two candidate IgG biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease.

21215734|t|The neuroprotective domains of the amyloid precursor protein, in traumatic brain injury, are located in the two growth factor domains.
21215734|a|The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is known to increase following traumatic brain injury (TBI). This increase in levels of APP may be deleterious to outcome due to the production of neurotoxic Abeta. Conversely, this upregulation may be beneficial as cleavage of APP via the alternative non-amyloidogenic pathway produces the soluble alpha form of APP (sAPPalpha), which is known to have many neuroprotective and neurotrophic functions. Indeed it has previously been shown that treatment with sAPPalpha following a diffuse injury in rats improves outcome. However, the exact location within the sAPPalpha molecule which contains this neuroprotective activity has yet to be determined. The sAPPalpha peptide can consist of up to 6 domains, with the main isoform in the brain missing the 4th and 5th. Of the remaining domains, the D1 and D6a domains seem the most likely as they have been shown to have beneficial actions in vitro. This present study examined the effects of in vivo posttraumatic administration via an intracerebroventricular injection of the D1, D2 and D6a domains of sAPPalpha on outcome following moderate-impact acceleration TBI in rats. While treatment with either the D1 or D6a domains was found to significantly improve motor and cognitive outcome, as assessed on the rotarod and Y maze, treatment with the D2 domain had no effect. Furthermore axonal injury was reduced in D1 and D6a domain treated animals, but not those that received the D2 domain. As the D1 and D6a domains contain a heparin binding region while the D2 domain does not, this suggests that sAPPalpha mediates its neuroprotective response through its ability to bind to heparin sulfate proteoglycans.

21216142|t|Synthesis and biological evaluation of indole-chalcone derivatives as beta-amyloid imaging probe.
21216142|a|A series of chaclone derivatives containing an indole moiety were evaluated in competitive binding assays with Abeta(1-42) aggregates versus [(125)I]IMPY. The affinity of these compounds ranged from 4.46 to >1008 nM, depending on the substitution on the phenyl ring. Fluorescent staining in vitro showed that one compound with a N,N-dimethylamino group intensely stained Abeta plaques within brain sections of AD transgenic mice. The radioiodinated probe [(125)I]-(E)-3-(1H-indol-5-yl)-1-(4-iodophenyl)prop-2-en-1-one, [(125)I]4, was prepared and autoradiography in sections of brain tissue from an animal model of AD showed that it labeled Abeta plaques specifically. However, experiments with normal mice indicated that [(125)I]4 exhibited a low uptake into the brain in vivo (0.41% ID/g at 2 min). Additional chemical modifications of this indole-chalcone structure may lead to more useful imaging agents for detecting beta-amyloid plaques in the brains of AD patients.

21216146|t|99mTc- and Re-labeled 6-dialkylamino-2-naphthylethylidene derivatives as imaging probes for beta-amyloid plaques.
21216146|a|Based on the conjugate strategy, two neutral (99m)Tc labeled 2-(1-(6-(dialkylamino)naphthalen-2-yl)ethylidene)malononitrile (DDNP) and 1-(6-(dialkylamino)naphthalen-2-yl)ethanone (ENE) derivatives, and their corresponding rhenium complexes were synthesized. In vitro fluorescent staining indicated that the corresponding rhenium derivatives selectively stained the beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques in the brain sections of AD model mice with low background. Compared with FDDNP and FENE, the affinities of the corresponding rhenium derivatives to Abeta aggregates decreased about 10-14-fold. In vivo biodistribution experiments in normal mice showed that (99m)Tc-MAMA-ENE displayed medium initial brain uptake (0.65%ID/g at 2min) with a reasonable washout from the brain (0.19%ID/g at 2h) while (99m)Tc-MAMA-DDNP showed a low brain uptake (0.28%ID/g at 2 min). Further optimize these (99m)Tc-labeled tracers in order to improve their binding affinities to Abeta plaques and diffusion through the blood brain barrier may generate useful imaging agents for SPECT.

21216281|t|On the in vivo early toxic properties of A-beta 25-35 peptide in the rat hippocampus: involvement of the Receptor-for-Advanced Glycation-End-Products and changes in gene expression.
21216281|a|Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) deposition is assumed to play a pathogenic role in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients. To date, the precise mechanisms underlying Abeta toxicity are not fully understood. A recent hypothesis suggesting that the Receptor-for-Advanced-Glycation-End-Products (RAGE)-a trans-membrane protein signaling for oxidative stress-is involved in Abeta toxicity is gaining attention. Early Abeta toxicity could indeed help to explain the deleterious events further produced by this molecule in the brain. In this work, we evaluated the pattern of early expression of RAGE in the toxic model induced by Ass25-35 in rat CA1 region. Intrahippocampal injections of Abeta25-35 in rats increased the RAGE expression at 24 h post-injection; this event was accompanied by increased components of RAGE downstream signaling in hippocampal cells, such as enhanced expression of the pro-apoptotic factor NF-kappaB, increased nitric oxide production, LDH leakage, mitochondrial dysfunction, increased TNF-alpha expression, antioxidant genes down-regulation, and augmented neurodegeneration. Our findings support an active role of RAGE during the early stages of Abeta25-35 toxicity in the hippocampus.

21216965|t|Distinct effects of Zn2+, Cu2+, Fe3+, and Al3+ on amyloid-beta stability, oligomerization, and aggregation: amyloid-beta destabilization promotes annular protofibril formation.
21216965|a|Abnormally high concentrations of Zn(2+), Cu(2+), and Fe(3+) are present along with amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the senile plaques in Alzheimer disease, where Al(3+) is also detected. Abeta aggregation is the key pathogenic event in Alzheimer disease, where Abeta oligomers are the major culprits. The fundamental mechanism of these metal ions on Abeta remains elusive. Here, we employ 4,4'-Bis(1-anilinonaphthalene 8-sulfonate) and tyrosine fluorescence, CD, stopped flow fluorescence, guanidine hydrochloride denaturation, and photo-induced cross-linking to elucidate the effect of Zn(2+), Cu(2+), Fe(3+), and Al(3+) on Abeta at the early stage of the aggregation. Furthermore, thioflavin T assay, dot blotting, and transmission electron microscopy are utilized to examine Abeta aggregation. Our results show that Al(3+) and Zn(2+), but not Cu(2+) and Fe(3+), induce larger hydrophobic exposures of Abeta conformation, resulting in its significant destabilization at the early stage. The metal ion binding induces Abeta conformational changes with micromolar binding affinities and millisecond binding kinetics. Cu(2+) and Zn(2+) induce similar assembly of transiently appearing Abeta oligomers at the early state. During the aggregation, we found that Zn(2+) exclusively promotes the annular protofibril formation without undergoing a nucleation process, whereas Cu(2+) and Fe(3+) inhibit fibril formation by prolonging the nucleation phases. Al(3+) also inhibits fibril formation; however, the annular oligomers co-exist in the aggregation pathway. In conclusion, Zn(2+), Cu(2+), Fe(3+), and Al(3+) adopt distinct folding and aggregation mechanisms to affect Abeta, where Abeta destabilization promotes annular protofibril formation. Our study facilitates the understanding of annular Abeta oligomer formation upon metal ion binding.

21219931|t|Amyloid-beta42 alters apolipoprotein E solubility in brains of mice with five familial AD mutations.
21219931|a|Amyloid plaques composed of the 42 amino acid form of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta42) are a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but soluble and intraneuronal Abeta42 are the more proximal causes of synaptic dysfunction and neurotoxicity. Apolipoprotein E (apoE) modulates this disease process, as inheritance of the e4 allele of the apoE gene is the primary genetic risk factor for AD. To address the solubility of Abeta42 and apoE, the 5xFAD-specific extraction profile for Abeta42 was optimized, a protein extraction protocol was optimized in the presence of minimal to extensive Abeta42 pathology. Sequential extractions with TBS, TBS+Triton X-100 (TBSX), and guanidine-HCl (GuHCl) or formic acid (FA) were used with tissue from young and old wild type or mice expressing 5 familial AD mutations (5xFAD), in disease-susceptible or -resistant brain regions. In older 5xFAD mice, the extraction of insoluble Abeta42 and m-apoE protein was increased with FA compared to GuHCl. The 5 FAD mutations significantly increase production of Abeta42, recapitulating AD-like pathology at a greatly accelerated rate. Consistent protein extraction and the specificity of extractions for soluble or membrane-associated proteins were demonstrated. Age-dependent increases in Abeta42 were observed in all extraction fractions, particularly in the cortex and hippocampus. In both young and old 5xFAD mice, Abeta42 is TBS- or GuHCl-soluble. While in WT mice m-apoE is TBSX-soluble, in 5xFAD mice m-apoE is TBS- or GuHCl-soluble. Thus, the 5xFAD-specific extraction profile of Abeta42 paralleled that of m-apoE. As now characterized, this method identifies the extraction profile for disease relevant apoE and Abeta in the brain, both normal or modified due to neuropathological processes.

21219955|t|Neuroprotective effects of Mycoplasma hyorhinis against amyloid-beta-peptide toxicity in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells are mediated by calpastatin upregulation in the mycoplasma-infected cells.
21219955|a|Mycoplasmas are frequent contaminants of cell cultures. Contamination leads to altered synthetic and metabolic pathways. We have found that contamination of neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells by a strain of Mycoplasma hyorhinis derived from SH-SY5Y cell culture (NDMh) leads to increased levels of calpastatin (the endogenous inhibitor of the Ca(2+)-dependent protease, calpain) in NDMh-infected cells. We have now examined effects of amyloid-beta-peptide (Abeta) (central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease) on uncontaminated (clean) and NDMh-infected SH-SY5Y cells. Abeta was toxic to clean cells, resulting in necrotic cell damage. Abeta treatment led to activation of calpain and enhanced proteolysis, cell swelling, cell membrane permeability to propidium iodide (PI) (without nuclear apoptotic changes), and diminished mitochondrial enzyme activity (XTT reduction). Abeta-toxicity was attenuated in the high calpastatin-containing NDMh-infected cells, as shown by inhibition of calpain activation and activity, no membrane permeability, normal cell morphology, and maintenance of mitochondrial enzyme activity (similar to attenuation of Abeta-toxicity in non-infected cells overexpressing calpastatin following calpastatin-plasmid introduction into the cells). By contrast, staurosporine affected both clean and infected cells, causing apoptotic damage (cell shrinkage, nuclear apoptotic alterations, caspase-3 activation and caspase-promoted proteolysis, without PI permeability, and without effect on XTT reduction). The results indicate that mycoplasma protects the cells against certain types of insults involving calpain. The ratio of calpastatin to calpain is an important factor in the control of calpain activity. Exogenous pharmacological means, including calpastatin-based inhibitors, have been considered for therapy of various diseases in which calpain is implicated. Mycoplasmas provide the first naturally occurring biological system that upregulates the endogenous calpain inhibitor, and thus may be of interest in devising treatments for some disorders, such as neurodegenerative diseases.

21220018|t|CCR2/CCL2-mediated inflammation protects photoreceptor cells from amyloid-beta-induced apoptosis.
21220018|a|Age-related macular degeneration is characterized by the formation of drusen containing amyloid-beta (Abeta) and the degeneration of photoreceptors. To explore the largely unknown role of Abeta in the retina, we investigated the effects on photoreceptors of the oligomeric form of Abeta(1-42). Subretinal injection of the Abeta peptide induced misplaced expression of recoverin and synaptophysin in the photoreceptors, oxidative stress in their inner and outer segments, and finally apoptosis. Abeta did not induce cell death in purified photoreceptor cell cultures, but did so in retinal cell cultures, thereby suggesting that the cellular environment plays a role in Abeta-induced photoreceptor apoptosis. Subretinal injection of Abeta was followed by activation and migration of microglial cells and then by photoreceptor apoptosis. Microglial cells phagocytosed rhodopsin-containing debris and Abeta in the subretinal space. Quantitative RT-PCR allowed us to identify a specific gene expression profile associated with the Abeta-induced progression of retinal degeneration and consistent with oxidative stress, inflammation, and an apoptotic program. The gene most highly upregulated in Abeta-injected retinas was that for the chemokine CCL2, and its absence or that of its cognate receptor CCR2 greatly reduced migration of activated microglial cells to the site of retinal injury and profoundly worsened photoreceptor degeneration and disorganization of the retinal pigment epithelium in Abeta-injected retinas. Our study pinpoints the roles of Abeta and of CCL2/CCR2 axis-dependent inflammation in photoreceptor apoptosis.

21220023|t|Mechanism mediating oligomeric Abeta clearance by naive primary microglia.
21220023|a|The accumulation of soluble oligomeric amyloid-beta peptide (oAbeta) proceeds the formation of senile plaques and contributes to synaptic and memory deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The mechanism of mediating microglial oAbeta clearance remains unclear and thought to occur via scavenger receptors (SRs) in microglia. SRs respond to their ligands in a subtype-specific manner. Therefore, we sought to identify the specific subtypes of SRs that mediate oAbeta internalization and proteases that degrade oAbeta species in naive primary microglia. The component of oAbeta species were characterized by western blot analysis, analytical ultracentrifugation analysis, and atomic force microscopy. The oAbeta species remained soluble in the medium and microglial lysates during incubation at 37  C. SR-A, but not CD36, mediated oAbeta internalization in microglia as suggested by the use of subtype-specific neutralizing antibodies and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that oAbeta interacted with SR-A on the plasma membrane. After internalization, over 40% of oAbeta vesicles were trafficked toward lysosomes and degraded by cysteine proteases, including cathepsin B. The inhibitors of proteasome, neprilysin, matrix metalloproteinases, and insulin degrading enzyme failed to protect internalized oAbeta from degradation. Our study suggests that SR-A and lysosomal cathepsin B are critical in microglial oAbeta clearance, providing insight into how microglia are involved in the clearance of oAbeta and their roles in the early stages of AD.

21220305|t|Atomic structure of a nanobody-trapped domain-swapped dimer of an amyloidogenic beta2-microglobulin variant.
21220305|a|Atomic-level structural investigation of the key conformational intermediates of amyloidogenesis remains a challenge. Here we demonstrate the utility of nanobodies to trap and characterize intermediates of beta2-microglobulin (beta2m) amyloidogenesis by X-ray crystallography. For this purpose, we selected five single domain antibodies that block the fibrillogenesis of a proteolytic amyloidogenic fragment of beta2m (DeltaN6beta2m). The crystal structure of DeltaN6beta2m in complex with one of these nanobodies (Nb24) identifies domain swapping as a plausible mechanism of self-association of this amyloidogenic protein. In the swapped dimer, two extended hinge loops--corresponding to the heptapetide NHVTLSQ that forms amyloid in isolation--are unmasked and fold into a new two-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet. The beta-strands of this sheet are prone to self-associate and stack perpendicular to the direction of the strands to build large intermolecular beta-sheets that run parallel to the axis of growing oligomers, providing an elongation mechanism by self-templated growth.

21228172|t|PKC epsilon activation prevents synaptic loss, Abeta elevation, and cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease transgenic mice.
21228172|a|Among the pathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) neurodegeneration, only synaptic loss in the brains of AD patients closely correlates with the degree of dementia in vivo. Here, we describe a molecular basis for this AD loss of synapses: pathological reduction of synaptogenic PKC isozymes and their downstream synaptogenic substrates, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor. This reduction, particularly of PKC alpha and epsilon, occurs in association with elevation of soluble beta amyloid protein (Abeta), but before the appearance of the amyloid plaques or neuronal loss in the Tg2576 AD transgenic mouse strain. Conversely, treatment of the Tg2576 mouse brain with the PKC activator, bryostatin-1, restores normal or supranormal levels of PKC alpha and epsilon, reduces the level of soluble Abeta, prevents and/or reverses the loss of hippocampal synapses, and prevents the memory impairment observed at 5 months postpartum. Similarly, the PKC epsilon-specific activator, DCP-LA, effectively prevents synaptic loss, amyloid plaques, and cognitive deficits (also prevented by bryostatin-1) in the much more rapidly progressing 5XFAD transgenic strain. These results suggest that synaptic loss and the resulting cognitive deficits depend on the balance between the lowering effects of Abeta on PKC alpha and epsilon versus the lowering effects of PKC on Abeta in AD transgenic mice.

21228179|t|Amyloid-beta/Fyn-induced synaptic, network, and cognitive impairments depend on tau levels in multiple mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.
21228179|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disorder, is a growing public health problem and still lacks effective treatments. Recent evidence suggests that microtubule-associated protein tau may mediate amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) toxicity by modulating the tyrosine kinase Fyn. We showed previously that tau reduction prevents, and Fyn overexpression exacerbates, cognitive deficits in human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) transgenic mice overexpressing Abeta. However, the mechanisms by which Abeta, tau, and Fyn cooperate in AD-related pathogenesis remain to be fully elucidated. Here we examined the synaptic and network effects of this pathogenic triad. Tau reduction prevented cognitive decline induced by synergistic effects of Abeta and Fyn. Tau reduction also prevented synaptic transmission and plasticity deficits in hAPP mice. Using electroencephalography to examine network effects, we found that tau reduction prevented spontaneous epileptiform activity in multiple lines of hAPP mice. Tau reduction also reduced the severity of spontaneous and chemically induced seizures in mice overexpressing both Abeta and Fyn. To better understand these protective effects, we recorded whole-cell currents in acute hippocampal slices from hAPP mice with and without tau. hAPP mice with tau had increased spontaneous and evoked excitatory currents, reduced inhibitory currents, and NMDA receptor dysfunction. Tau reduction increased inhibitory currents and normalized excitation/inhibition balance and NMDA receptor-mediated currents in hAPP mice. Our results indicate that Abeta, tau, and Fyn jointly impair synaptic and network function and suggest that disrupting the copathogenic relationship between these factors could be of therapeutic benefit.

21228296|t|Improving CSF biomarker accuracy in predicting prevalent and incident Alzheimer disease.
21228296|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate factors, including cognitive and brain reserve, which may independently predict prevalent and incident dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) and to determine whether inclusion of identified factors increases the predictive accuracy of the CSF biomarkers Abeta(42), tau, ptau(181), tau/Abeta(42), and ptau(181)/Abeta(42). METHODS: Logistic regression identified variables that predicted prevalent DAT when considered together with each CSF biomarker in a cross-sectional sample of 201 participants with normal cognition and 46 with DAT. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) from the resulting model was compared with the AUC generated using the biomarker alone. In a second sample with normal cognition at baseline and longitudinal data available (n = 213), Cox proportional hazards models identified variables that predicted incident DAT together with each biomarker, and the models' concordance probability estimate (CPE), which was compared to the CPE generated using the biomarker alone. RESULTS: APOE genotype including an epsilon4 allele, male gender, and smaller normalized whole brain volumes (nWBV) were cross-sectionally associated with DAT when considered together with every biomarker. In the longitudinal sample (mean follow-up = 3.2 years), 14 participants (6.6%) developed DAT. Older age predicted a faster time to DAT in every model, and greater education predicted a slower time in 4 of 5 models. Inclusion of ancillary variables resulted in better cross-sectional prediction of DAT for all biomarkers (p < 0.0021), and better longitudinal prediction for 4 of 5 biomarkers (p < 0.0022). CONCLUSIONS: The predictive accuracy of CSF biomarkers is improved by including age, education, and nWBV in analyses.

21228297|t|Default mode network connectivity in stable vs progressive mild cognitive impairment.
21228297|a|OBJECTIVE: Dysfunction of the default mode network (DMN) has been identified in prior cross-sectional fMRI studies of Alzheimer disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI); however, no studies have examined its utility in predicting future cognitive decline. METHODS: fMRI scans during a face-name memory task were acquired from a cohort of 68 subjects (25 normal control, 31 MCI, and 12 AD). Subjects with MCI were followed for 2.4 years (+-0.8) to determine progression to AD. Maps of DMN connectivity were compared with a template DMN map constructed from elderly normal controls to obtain goodness-of-fit (GOF) indices of DMN expression. Indices were compared between groups and correlated with cognitive decline. RESULTS: GOF indices were highest in normal controls, intermediate in MCI, and lowest in AD (p < 0.0001). In a predictive model (that included baseline GOF indices, age, education, Mini-Mental State Examination score, and an index of DMN gray matter volume), the effect of GOF index on progression from MCI to dementia was significant. In MCI, baseline GOF indices were correlated with change from baseline in functional status (Clinical Dementia Rating-sum of boxes) (r = -0.40, p < 0.04). However, there was no additional predictive value for DMN connectivity when baseline delayed recall was included in the models. CONCLUSIONS: fMRI connectivity indices distinguish patients with MCI who undergo cognitive decline and conversion to AD from those who remain stable over a 2- to 3-year follow-up period. Our data support the notion of different functional brain connectivity endophenotypes for "early" vs "late" MCI, which are associated with different baseline memory scores and different rates of progression and conversion.

21235004|t|Effects of fibrillar Abeta(1-40) on the viability of primary cultures of cholinergic neurons and the expression of insulin signaling-related proteins.
21235004|a|To investigate the effects of fibrillar Abeta(1-40) on the morphology and viability of cholinergic neurons and the involvement of the insulin-signaling pathway, we established primary cultures of rat basal forebrain cholinergic neurons and observed their responses to treatment with fibrillar Abeta(1-40) at different concentrations for different durations. Cell morphology was examined under microscope after immunofluorescence staining for neurofilament protein, cell vitality accessed by the Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay, and expressions of a panel of insulin signaling-related proteins was detected by Western blot analysis. We show here that, at low concentrations of 0.1-1.0 micromol/L, fibrillar Abeta(1-40) had little effects on the cells; however, at higher concentrations of 2-10 mumicromol/L, it caused pathological changes, decreased the cell viability, and reduced the expression of insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate-I, Protein Kinase B, and B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that fibrillar Abeta(1-40) not only decreases the viability of cholinergic neuron but also down regulates the expression of important proteins in the insulin signal transduction pathway. We speculate that fibrillar Abeta(1-40) may contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's through disrupting the insulin signaling pathway, therefore decreasing neuronal activity and eventually leading to the apoptosis and cell loss.

21235355|t|Astrocytic redox remodeling by amyloid beta peptide.
21235355|a|Astrocytes are critical for neuronal redox homeostasis providing them with cysteine needed for glutathione synthesis. In this study, we demonstrate that the astrocytic redox response signature provoked by amyloid beta (Abeta) is distinct from that of a general oxidant (tertiary-butylhydroperoxide [t-BuOOH]). Acute Abeta treatment increased cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) levels and enhanced transsulfuration flux in contrast to repeated Abeta exposure, which decreased CBS and catalase protein levels. Although t-BuOOH also increased transsulfuration flux, CBS levels were unaffected. The net effect of Abeta treatment was an oxidative shift in the intracellular glutathione/glutathione disulfide redox potential in contrast to a reductive shift in response to peroxide. In the extracellular compartment, Abeta, but not t-BuOOH, enhanced cystine uptake and cysteine accumulation, and resulted in remodeling of the extracellular cysteine/cystine redox potential in the reductive direction. The redox changes elicited by Abeta but not peroxide were associated with enhanced DNA synthesis. CBS activity and protein levels tended to be lower in cerebellum from patients with Alzheimer's disease than in age-matched controls. Our study suggests that the alterations in astrocytic redox status could compromise the neuroprotective potential of astrocytes and may be a potential new target for therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer's disease.

21236688|t|Synthesis, physical-chemical characterisation and biological evaluation of novel 2-amido-3-hydroxypyridin-4(1H)-ones: Iron chelators with the potential for treating Alzheimer's disease.
21236688|a|A novel class of 2-amido-3-hydroxypyridin-4-one iron chelators is described. These compounds have been designed to behave as suitable molecular probes which will improve our knowledge of the role of iron in neurodegenerative conditions. Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson disease (PD), can be considered as diverse pathological conditions sharing critical metabolic processes such as protein aggregation and oxidative stress. Interestingly, both these metabolic alterations seem to be associated with the involvement of metal ions, including iron. Iron chelation is therefore a potential therapeutic approach. The physico-chemical (pK(a), pFe(3+) and logP) and biological properties (inhibition of iron-containing enzymes) of these chelators have been investigated in order to obtain a suitable profile for the treatment of neurodegenerative conditions. Studies with neuronal cell cultures confirm that the new iron chelators are neuroprotective against beta-amyloid-induced toxicity.

21239495|t|Presenilins promote the cellular uptake of copper and zinc and maintain copper chaperone of SOD1-dependent copper/zinc superoxide dismutase activity.
21239495|a|Dyshomeostasis of extracellular zinc and copper has been implicated in beta-amyloid aggregation, the major pathology associated with Alzheimer disease. Presenilin mediates the proteolytic cleavage of the beta-amyloid precursor protein to release beta-amyloid, and mutations in presenilin can cause familial Alzheimer disease. We tested whether presenilin expression affects copper and zinc transport. Studying murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from presenilin knock-out mice or RNA interference of presenilin expression in HEK293T cells, we observed a marked decrease in saturable uptake of radiolabeled copper and zinc. Measurement of basal metal levels in 6-month-old presenilin 1 heterozygous knock-out (PS1(+/-)) mice revealed significant deficiencies of copper and zinc in several tissues, including brain. Copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) activity was significantly decreased in both presenilin knock-out MEFs and brain tissue of presenilin 1 heterozygous knock-out mice. In the MEFs and PS1(+/-) brains, copper chaperone of SOD1 (CCS) levels were decreased. Zinc-dependent alkaline phosphatase activity was not decreased in the PS null MEFs. These data indicate that presenilins are important for cellular copper and zinc turnover, influencing SOD1 activity, and having the potential to indirectly impact beta-amyloid aggregation through metal ion clearance.

21239853|t|Blocking the apolipoprotein E/amyloid-beta interaction reduces fibrillar vascular amyloid deposition and cerebral microhemorrhages in TgSwDI mice.
21239853|a|The accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides as toxic oligomers, amyloid plaques, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is critical in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The binding of Abeta peptides to apolipoprotein E (ApoE) plays an important role in modulation of amyloid deposition and clearance. We have shown that blocking the Abeta/ApoE interaction with Abeta(12-28P), a nontoxic blood-brain-barrier permeable and non-fibrillogenic synthetic peptide, constitutes a novel therapeutic approach for AD by reducing Abeta parenchymal deposition. In the present study, we investigate this therapeutic effect on CAA in the transgenic (Tg) AD mice model (TgSwDI), which expresses Swedish (K670N/M671L), Dutch (E693Q)/Iowa (D694N) AbetaPP mutations. These mice develop abundant CAA beginning at the age of 6 months. Behavioral results show that Abeta(12-28P) treated TgSwDI AD mice performed the same as wild-type mice, whereas vehicle treated TgSwDI were impaired in spatial memory. Furthermore, this treatment resulted in a significant reduction of total amyloid burden, especially the fibrillar vascular amyloid burden, which importantly was accompanied by a reduction in microhemorrhages and neuroinflammation. Measurement of Abeta levels in the brain homogenate revealed a significant decrease in both the total amount of Abeta and Abeta oligomer levels in Abeta(12-28P) treated TgSwDI mice. These findings suggest that blocking the Abeta/ApoE interaction is a highly effective therapeutic approach for vascular amyloid deposition, in contrast to some other therapeutic approaches.

21241669|t|Morphological changes in the enteric nervous system of aging and APP23 transgenic mice.
21241669|a|Gastrointestinal motility disorders often pose a debilitating problem, especially in elderly patients. In addition, they are frequently occurring co-morbidities in dementia. Whereas a failing enteric nervous system has already been shown to be involved in gastrointestinal motility disorders and in Parkinson's disease, a relationship with the neurodegenerative process of Alzheimer's disease was not yet shown. Therefore, we sought to document quantitative changes in the distribution of betaIII-tubulin (general neuronal marker), Substance P, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and S-100 immunoreactivity in addition to a qualitative assessment of the presence of amyloid in the small and large intestines of 6, 12 and 18-month-old wild type and transgenic Thy-1-APP23 mice. Amyloid deposits were seen in the vasculature, the mucosal and muscle layer of both heterozygous and wild type mice. Amyloidbeta1-42 could not be detected, pointing to a different amyloid composition than that found in senile plaques in the mice's brains. The finding of an increased density of betaIII-tubulin-, Substance P- and NOS-IR-nerve fibres in heterozygous mice could not undoubtedly be related to amyloid deposition or to an activation of glial cells. Therefore, the alterations at the level of the enteric nervous system and the deposition of amyloid seem not primarily involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. At most they are secondary related to the neurodegenerative process. Additionally, our data could not show extensive neuronal or glial cell loss associated with aging, in contrast to other reports. Instead an increase in S100-IR was observed in senescent mice.

21241676|t|ERK pathway activation is required for amyloid-beta(1-40)(-)induced neurotoxicity of THP-1 human monocytes towards SK-N-SH neuroblastoma.
21241676|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid-beta peptide deposition, increased activated microglia, and progressive loss of neurons in the brain. Although Abeta1-40 can elicit inflammation in microglia, the intracellular signaling events mediating these effects are poorly defined. Here we show that cell-free supernatant from Abeta1-40-treated THP-1 monocytes induced cytotoxicity towards neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells. Exposure of THP-1 monocytes to Abeta1-40 leads to increased tyrosine phosphorylation and extracellular signaling-regulated kinase (ERK) and increased levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-8, and TNF-alpha) in the supernatant of THP-1 monocytes. Pretreatment of THP-1 monocytes with either a protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitor or an ERK inhibitor protects SK-N-SH cells from the cytotoxic effect of conditional supernatant from Abeta1-40-treated THP-1 monocytes. Abeta1-40-treated THP-1 monocytes also lead to upregulation of cyclooxygenase-2 and iNOS expression and increased of nitric oxide production. These results suggest that Abeta1-40-induced activation of PTK/MEK/ERK pathway in THP-1 monocytes leads to the release of inflammatory factors that are toxic to SK-N-SH cells and might contribute to the onset of AD.

21241801|t|Amyloid beta impairs mitochondrial anterograde transport and degenerates synapses in Alzheimer's disease neurons.
21241801|a|Loss of synapses and synaptic damage are the best correlates of cognitive decline identified in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and mitochondrial oxidative damage and synaptic pathology have been identified as early events in the progression of AD. The progressive accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) in synapses and synaptic mitochondria are hypothesized to cause synaptic degeneration and cognitive decline in patients with AD. However, the precise mechanistic link between Abeta and mitochondria is not well understood. The purpose of this study was to better understand the effects of Abeta on mitochondrial axonal transport and synaptic alterations in AD. Using mouse hippocampal neurons and Abeta(25-35) peptide, we studied axonal transport of mitochondria, including mitochondrial motility, mitochondrial length and size, mitochondrial index per neurite, and synaptic alterations of the hippocampal neurons. In the PBS-treated neurons, 36.4+-4.7% of the observed mitochondria were motile, with 21.0+-1.3% moving anterograde and 15.4+-3.4% moving retrograde and the average speed of movement was 12.1+-1.8mum/min. In contrast, in the Abeta-treated neurons, the number of motile mitochondria were significantly less, at 20.4+-2.6% (P<0.032), as were those moving anterograde (10.1+-2.6%, P<0.016) relative to PBS-treated neurons, suggesting that the Abeta(25-35) peptide impairs axonal transport of mitochondria in AD neurons. In the Abeta-treated neurons, the average speed of motile mitochondria was also less, at 10.9+-1.9mum/min, and mitochondrial length was significantly decreased. Further, synaptic immunoreactivity was also significantly less in the Abeta-treated neurons relative to the PBS-treated neurons, indicating that Abeta affects synaptic viability. These findings suggest that, in neurons affected by AD, Abeta is toxic, impairs mitochondrial movements, reduces mitochondrial length, and causes synaptic degeneration.

21243369|t|Granular expression of prolyl-peptidyl isomerase PIN1 is a constant and specific feature of Alzheimer's disease pathology and is independent of tau, Abeta and TDP-43 pathology.
21243369|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) manifests with progressive memory loss and decline of spatial awareness and motor skills. Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) represent one of the pathological hallmarks of AD. Previous studies suggest that the enzyme prolyl-peptidyl cis-trans isomerase PIN1 [protein interacting with NIMA (never in mitosis A)-1] recognizes hyperphosphorylated tau (in NFTs) and facilitates its dephosphorylation, thereby recovering its function. This study aims to determine the frequency, severity and distribution of PIN1 immunoreactivity and its relationship to NFTs and other neuropathological markers of neurodegeneration such as amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and transcription-responsive DNA-binding protein of M(r) 43 kDa (TDP-43). Immunohistochemical analysis of 194 patients (46 with AD, 43 with Parkinson's disease/dementia with Lewy bodies, 12 with progressive supranuclear palsy/corticobasal degeneration, 36 with frontotemporal lobar degeneration, 21 with motor neuron disease and 34 non-demented (ND) individuals) revealed an increased frequency and severity of PIN1 immunoreactive inclusions in AD as compared to all diagnostic groups (P < 0.001). The hippocampal and cortical distribution of PIN1 granules was distinct from that of NFTs, Abeta and TDP-43 pathologies, though the frequency of neurons with PIN1 immunoreactivity increased with increasing NFT pathology. There was a progressive increase in PIN1 changes in ND individuals as the degree of AD-type pathological changes increased. Present findings indicate that PIN1 changes are a constant feature of AD pathology and could serve as a biomarker of the onset or spread of AD neuropathology independent of tau or Abeta.

21244100|t|Protein array based interactome analysis of amyloid-beta indicates an inhibition of protein translation.
21244100|a|Oligomeric amyloid-beta is currently of interest in amyloid-beta mediated toxicity and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Mapping the amyloid-beta interaction partners could help to discover novel pathways in disease pathogenesis. To discover the amyloid-beta interaction partners, we applied a protein array with more than 8100 unique recombinantly expressed human proteins. We identified 324 proteins as potential interactors of oligomeric amyloid-beta. The Gene Ontology functional analysis of these proteins showed that oligomeric amyloid-beta bound to multiple proteins with diverse functions both from extra and intracellular localizations. This undiscriminating binding phenotype indicates that multiple protein interactions mediate the toxicity of the oligomeric amyloid-beta. The most highly impacted cellular system was the protein translation machinery. Oligomeric amyloid-beta could bind to altogether 24 proteins involved in translation initiation and elongation. The binding of amyloid-beta to purified rat hippocampal ribosomes validated the protein array results. More importantly, in vitro translation assays showed that the oligomeric amyloid-beta had a concentration dependent inhibitory activity on translation. Our results indicate that the inhibited protein synthesis is one of the pathways that can be involved in the amyloid-beta induced neurotoxicity.

21244582|t|The impact of cerebral amyloid angiopathy on the occurrence of cerebrovascular lesions in demented patients with Alzheimer features: a neuropathological study.
21244582|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this neuropathological study was to determine the prevalence of the different cerebrovascular lesions to be attributed to cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and of those associated with the severity of the Alzheimer dementia (AD) itself. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The cerebrovascular lesions were compared separately in 40 brains of patients with mild and 50 with severe AD features. In the two groups, the number of lesions were compared between the brains with severe and those with mild of absent CAA. RESULTS: The age of the patients, the vascular risk factors and antithrombotic treatment were similar in all the compared groups. The brains with mild and severe AD features and with CAA contained more haematomas, cortical micro-infarcts and micro-bleeds, and more severe white matter changes, and cortico-subcortical and white matter mini-bleeds. In the CAA brains with severe AD features, also more cortical territorial infarcts were observed, compared to those with mild AD features. CONCLUSIONS: The increase in cortical infarcts cannot be attributed to the CAA alone, but also to the severity of the degenerative features, implying additional vascular factors in the pathogenesis of AD.

21244841|t|What drives amyloid molecules to assemble into oligomers and fibrils?
21244841|a|We develop a theory for three states of equilibrium of amyloid peptides: the monomer, oligomer, and fibril. We assume that the oligomeric state is a disordered micellelike collection of a few peptide chains held together loosely by hydrophobic interactions into a spherical hydrophobic core. We assume that fibrillar amyloid chains are aligned and further stabilized by steric zipper interactions-hydrogen bonding, steric packing, and specific hydrophobic side-chain contacts. The model makes a broad set of predictions that are consistent with experimental results: 1), Similar to surfactant micellization, amyloid oligomerization should increase with peptide concentration in solution. 2), The onset of fibrillization limits the concentration of oligomers in the solution. 3), The extent of Abeta fibrillization increases with peptide concentration. 4), The predicted average fibril length versus monomer concentration agrees with data on alpha-synuclein. 5), Full fibril length distributions agree with data on alpha-synuclein. 6), Denaturants should melt out fibrils. And finally, 7), added salt should stabilize fibrils by reducing repulsions between amyloid peptide chains. It is of interest that small changes in solvent conditions can tip the equilibrium balance between oligomer and fibril and cause large changes in rates through effects on the transition-state barrier. This model may provide useful insights into the physical processes underlying amyloid diseases.

21245145|t|BACE1 retrograde trafficking is uniquely regulated by the cytoplasmic domain of sortilin.
21245145|a|BACE1 (beta-site beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP)-cleaving enzyme 1) mediates the first proteolytic cleavage of APP, leading to amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) production. It has been reported that BACE1 intracellular trafficking, in particular endosome-to-TGN sorting, is mediated by adaptor complexes, such as retromer and Golgi-localized gamma-ear-containing ARF-binding proteins (GGAs). Here we investigated whether sortilin, a Vps10p domain-sorting receptor believed to participate in retromer-mediated transport of select membrane cargoes, contributes to the subcellular trafficking and activity of BACE1. Our initial studies revealed increased levels of sortilin in post-mortem brain tissue of AD patients and that overexpression of sortilin leads to increased BACE1-mediated cleavage of APP in cultured cells. In contrast, RNAi suppression of sortilin results in decreased BACE1-mediated cleavage of APP. We also found that sortilin interacts with BACE1 and that a sortilin construct lacking its cytoplasmic domain, which contains putative retromer sorting motifs, remains bound to BACE1. However, expression of this truncated sortilin redistributes BACE1 from the trans-Golgi network to the endosomes and substantially reduces the retrograde trafficking of BACE1. Site-directed mutagenesis and chimera experiments reveal that the cytoplasmic tail of sortilin, but not those from other VPS10p domain receptors (e.g. SorCs1b and SorLA), plays a unique role in BACE1 trafficking. Our studies suggest a new function for sortilin as a modulator of BACE1 retrograde trafficking and subsequent generation of Abeta.

21245181|t|Association of plasma beta-amyloid level and cognitive reserve with subsequent cognitive decline.
21245181|a|CONTEXT: Lower plasma beta-amyloid 42 and 42/40 levels have been associated with incident dementia, but results are conflicting and few have investigated cognitive decline among elders without dementia. OBJECTIVE: To determine if plasma beta-amyloid is associated with cognitive decline and if this association is modified by measures of cognitive reserve. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We studied 997 black and white community-dwelling older adults from Memphis, Tennessee, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, who were enrolled in the Health ABC Study, a prospective observational study begun in 1997-1998 with 10-year follow-up in 2006-2007. Participant mean age was 74.0 (SD, 3.0) years; 55.2% (n = 550) were female; and 54.0% (n = 538) were black. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Association of near-baseline plasma beta-amyloid levels (42 and 42/40 measured in 2010) and repeatedly measured Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS) results. RESULTS: Low beta-amyloid 42/40 level was associated with greater 9-year 3MS cognitive decline (lowest beta-amyloid tertile: mean change in 3MS score, -6.59 [95% confidence interval [CI], -5.21 to -7.67] points; middle tertile: -6.16 [95% CI, -4.92 to -7.32] points; and highest tertile: -3.60 [95% CI, -2.27 to -4.73] points; P < .001). Results were similar after multivariate adjustment for age, race, education, diabetes, smoking, and apolipoprotein E [APOE ] e4 status and after excluding the 72 participants with incident dementia. Measures of cognitive reserve modified this association whereby among those with high reserve (at least a high school diploma, higher than sixth-grade literacy, or no APOE e4 allele), beta-amyloid 42/40 was less associated with multivariate adjusted 9-year decline. For example, among participants with less than a high school diploma, the 3MS score decline was -8.94 (95% CI, -6.94 to -10.94) for the lowest tertile compared with -4.45 (95% CI, -2.31 to -6.59) for the highest tertile, but for those with at least a high school diploma, 3MS score decline was -4.60 (95% CI,-3.07 to -6.13) for the lowest tertile and -2.88 (95% CI,-1.41 to -4.35) for the highest tertile (P = .004 for interaction). Interactions were also observed for literacy (P = .005) and for APOE e4 allele (P = .02). CONCLUSION: Lower plasma beta-amyloid 42/40 is associated with greater cognitive decline among elderly persons without dementia over 9 years, and this association is stronger among those with low measures of cognitive reserve.

21246381|t|beta-Site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) cleaves cerebellar Na+ channel beta4-subunit and promotes Purkinje cell firing by slowing the decay of resurgent Na+ current.
21246381|a|In cerebellar Purkinje cells, the beta4-subunit of voltage-dependent Na(+) channels has been proposed to serve as an open-channel blocker giving rise to a "resurgent" Na(+) current (I (NaR)) upon membrane repolarization. Notably, the beta4-subunit was recently identified as a novel substrate of the beta-secretase, BACE1, a key enzyme of the amyloidogenic pathway in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we asked whether BACE1-mediated cleavage of beta4-subunit has an impact on I (NaR) and, consequently, on the firing properties of Purkinje cells. In cerebellar tissue of BACE1-/- mice, mRNA levels of Na(+) channel alpha-subunits 1.1, 1.2, and 1.6 and of beta-subunits 1-4 remained unchanged, but processing of beta4 peptide was profoundly altered. Patch-clamp recordings from acutely isolated Purkinje cells of BACE1-/- and WT mice did not reveal any differences in steady-state properties and in current densities of transient, persistent, and resurgent Na(+) currents. However, I (NaR) was found to decay significantly faster in BACE1-deficient Purkinje cells than in WT cells. In modeling studies, the altered time course of I (NaR) decay could be replicated when we decreased the efficiency of open-channel block. In current-clamp recordings, BACE1-/- Purkinje cells displayed lower spontaneous firing rate than normal cells. Computer simulations supported the hypothesis that the accelerated decay kinetics of I (NaR) are responsible for the slower firing rate. Our study elucidates a novel function of BACE1 in the regulation of neuronal excitability that serves to tune the firing pattern of Purkinje cells and presumably other neurons endowed with I (NaR).

21248114|t|A novel role for {gamma}-secretase: selective regulation of spontaneous neurotransmitter release from hippocampal neurons.
21248114|a|With a multitude of substrates, gamma-secretase is poised to control neuronal function through a variety of signaling pathways. Presenilin 1 (PS1) is an integral component of gamma-secretase and is also a protein closely linked to the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To better understand the roles of gamma-secretase and PS1 in normal and pathological synaptic transmission, we examined evoked and spontaneous neurotransmitter release in cultured hippocampal neurons derived from PS1 knock-out (KO) mice. We found no changes in the size of evoked synaptic currents, short-term plasticity, or apparent calcium dependence of evoked release. The rate of spontaneous release from PS1 KO neurons was, however, approximately double that observed in wild-type (WT) neurons. This increase in spontaneous neurotransmission depended on calcium influx but did not require activation of voltage-gated calcium channels or presynaptic NMDA receptors or release of calcium from internal stores. The rate of spontaneous release from PS1 KO neurons was significantly reduced by lentivirus-mediated expression of WT PS1 or familial AD-linked M146V PS1, but not the D257A PS1 mutant that does not support gamma-secretase activity. Treatment of WT neuronal cultures with gamma-secretase inhibitor mimicked the loss of PS1, leading to a selective increase in spontaneous release without any change in the size of evoked synaptic currents. Together, these results identify a novel role for gamma-secretase in the control of spontaneous neurotransmission through modulation of low-level tonic calcium influx into presynaptic axon terminals.

21248127|t|Noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging detection of cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related microvascular alterations using superparamagnetic iron oxide particles in APP transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease: application to passive Abeta immunotherapy.
21248127|a|Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a common feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). More advanced stages are accompanied by microhemorrhages and vasculitis. Peripheral blood-borne macrophages are intimately linked to cerebrovascular pathology coincident with AD. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to noninvasively study microvascular lesions in amyloid precursor protein transgenic mouse AD models. Foci of signal attenuation were detected in cortical and thalamic brain regions of aged APP23 mice. Their strength and number was considerably enhanced by intravenous administration of iron oxide nanoparticles, which are taken up by macrophages through absorptive endocytosis, 24 h before image acquisition. The number of cortical sites displaying signal attenuation increased with age. Histology at these sites demonstrated the presence of iron-containing macrophages in the vicinity of CAA-affected blood vessels. A fraction of the sites additionally showed thickened vessel walls and vasculitis. Consistent with the visualization of CAA-associated lesions, MRI detected a much smaller number of attenuated signal sites in APP23xPS45 mice, for which a strong presenilin mutation caused a shift toward amyloid beta(42), thus reducing vascular amyloid. Similar results were obtained with APP24 and APP51 mice, which develop significantly less CAA and microvascular pathology than APP23. In a longitudinal study, we noninvasively demonstrated the reinforced formation of microvascular pathology during passive amyloid beta immunotherapy of APP23 mice. Histology confirmed that foci of signal attenuation reflected an increase in CAA-related lesions. Our data demonstrate that MRI has the sensitivity to noninvasively monitor the development of vascular pathology and its possible enhancement by amyloid beta immunotherapy in transgenic mice modeling AD.

21250822|t|Synthesis and biological evaluation of novel N,N'-bis-methylenedioxybenzyl-alkylenediamines as bivalent anti-Alzheimer disease ligands.
21250822|a|A novel series of N,N'-bis-methylenedioxybenzyl-alkylenediamines 5a-5g have been designed, synthesized and evaluated as bivalent anti-Alzheimer's disease ligands. The enzyme inhibition assay results indicated that compounds 5e-5g inhibit both acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) in the micromolar range (IC(50), 2.76-4.24 microM for AChE and 3.02-5.14 microM for BuChE), which was in the same potential as the reference compound rivastigmine (IC(50), 5.50 microM for AChE and 1.60 microM for BuChE). It was found that compounds could bind simultaneously to the peripheral and catalytic sites of AChE. beta-Amyloid (Abeta) aggregation inhibition assay results showed that compound 5e exhibited highest self-mediated Abeta fibril aggregation inhibition activity (40.3%) with a similar potential as curcumin (41.6%). It was also found that 5e-5g did not affect neuroblastoma cell viability at the concentration of 50 muM.

21251960|t|Selegiline-functionalized, PEGylated poly(alkyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles: Investigation of interaction with amyloid-beta peptide and surface reorganization.
21251960|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder for which the research of new treatments is highly challenging. Since the fibrillogenesis of amyloid-beta peptide 1-42 (Abeta(1-42)) peptide is considered as a major cause of neuronal degeneration, specific interest has been focused on aromatic molecules for targeting this peptide. In this paper, the synthesis of selegiline-functionalized and fluorescent poly(alkyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles (NPs) and their evaluation for the targeting of the Abeta(1-42) peptide are reported. The synthetic strategy relied on the design of amphiphilic copolymers by tandem Knoevenagel-Michael addition of cyanoacetate derivatives, followed by their self-assembly in aqueous solutions to give the corresponding NPs. Different cyanoacetates were used: (i) hexadecyl cyanoacetate (HDCA) to form the hydrophobic core of the NPs; (ii) rhodamine B cyanoacetate (RCA) for fluorescent purposes; (iii) methoxypoly(ethylene glycol) cyanoacetate (MePEGCA) for stealth properties and (iv) selegiline-poly(ethylene glycol) cyanoacetate (SelPEGCA) to obtain the desired functionality. Two different amphiphilic copolymers were synthesized, a selegiline-containing copolymer, P(MePEGCA-co-SelPEGCA-co-HDCA), and a rhodamine-labelled counterpart, P(MePEGCA-co-RCA-co-HDCA), further blended at variable ratios to tune the amount of selegiline moieties displayed at the surface of the NPs. Optimal formulations involving the different amphiphilic copolymers were determined by the study of the NP colloidal characteristics. Interestingly, it was shown that the zeta potential value of the selegiline-functionalized nanoparticles dramatically decreased, thus emphasizing a significant modification in the surface charge of the nanoparticles. Capillary electrophoresis has then been used to test the ability of the selegiline-functionalized NPs to interact with the Abeta(1-42) peptide. In comparison with non functionalized NPs, no increase of the interaction between these functionalized NPs and the monomeric form of the Abeta(1-42) peptide was observed, thus highlighting the lack of availability of the ligand at the surface of the nanoparticles. A mechanism explaining this result has been proposed and was mainly based on the burial of the hydrophobic selegiline ligand within the nanoparticles core.

21255744|t|National estimates of the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in the United States.
21255744|a|Several methods of estimating prevalence of dementia are presented in this article. For both Brookmeyer and the Chicago Health and Aging project (CHAP), the estimates of prevalence are derived statistically, forward calculating from incidence and survival figures. The choice of incidence rates on which to build the estimates may be critical. Brookmeyer used incidence rates from several published studies, whereas the CHAP investigators applied the incidence rates observed in their own cohort. The Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study (ADAMS) and the East Boston Senior Health Project (EBSHP) were sample surveys designed to ascertain the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and dementia. ADAMS obtained direct estimates by relying on probability sampling nationwide. EBSHP relied on projection of localized prevalence estimates to the national population. The sampling techniques of ADAMS and EBSHP were rather similar, whereas their disease definitions were not. By contrast, EBSPH and CHAP have similar disease definitions internally, but use different calculation techniques, and yet arrive at similar prevalence estimates, which are considerably greater than those obtained by either Brookmeyer or ADAMS. Choice of disease definition may play the larger role in explaining differences in observed prevalence between these studies.

21256848|t|Up-regulation of calsyntenin-3 by beta-amyloid increases vulnerability of cortical neurons.
21256848|a|beta-Amyloid (Abeta) may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. However, a causal relationship between Abeta oligomers and layer-specific neurodegeneration has not been clarified. Here we show up-regulation of calsyntenin (Cst)-3 in cultured neurons treated with Abeta oligomers and in Tg2576 mice. Cst-3 is distributed in large neurons in layers 2-3 and 5 of the cerebral cortex, and accumulated in dystrophic neurites surrounding Abeta-plaques. Overexpression of Cst-3 accelerates neuronal death. These results indicate that up-regulation of Cst-3 in cortical neurons in layers 2-3 and 5 by Abeta oligomers may lead to increase in vulnerability of neurons.

21257234|t|Combination therapy prevents amyloid-dependent and -independent structural changes.
21257234|a|Neuropathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are recapitulated in transgenic mice expressing familial AD-causing mutations, but ectopic transgene overexpression makes it difficult to relate these abnormalities to disease pathogenesis. Alternatively, the APP/PS-1 double knock-in (DKI) mouse produces mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin-1 (PS-1) with normal levels and regulatory controls. Here, we investigated effects of amyloid on brain structure and neuroplasticity by vaccinating DKI mice with amyloid-beta starting at 8 months of age. At 14 months, vaccination blocked cerebral amyloid deposition and its attendant microglial activation. Neuropil abnormalities were pronounced only within plaques, and included circumscribed loss and dysmorphology of axons, dendrites, terminals and spines. Blockade of amyloid deposition restored neuropil integrity. Amyloid removal did not rescue reductions in the hippocampal neural progenitor and neuroblast populations, but adding 1 month of voluntary exercise to amyloid-beta vaccination markedly stimulated hippocampal neurogenesis. These results identify amyloid-dependent and -independent structural changes in the DKI mouse model of AD. Combining exercise with amyloid-directed immunotherapy produces greater restoration of brain structure and neuroplasticity than is achieved with either maneuver alone.

21257714|t|Local cholesterol increase triggers amyloid precursor protein-Bace1 clustering in lipid rafts and rapid endocytosis.
21257714|a|Amyloid peptide (Abeta) is generated by sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-secretase (Bace1) and gamma-secretase. Abeta production increases after plasma membrane cholesterol loading through unknown mechanisms. To determine how APP-Bace1 proximity affects this phenomenon, we developed a fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy-Forster resonance energy transfer (FLIM-FRET) technique for visualization of these molecules either by epifluorescence or at the plasma membrane only using total internal reflection fluorescence. Further, we used fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to determine the lipid rafts partition of APP-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and Bace1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) molecules at the plasma membrane of neurons. We show that less than 10 min after cholesterol exposure, Bace1-GFP/APP-mCherry proximity increases selectively at the membrane and APP relocalizes to raft domains, preceded by rapid endocytosis. After longer cholesterol exposures, APP and Bace1 are found in proximity intracellularly. We demonstrate that cholesterol loading does not increase Abeta production by having a direct impact on Bace1 catalytic activity but rather by altering the accessibility of Bace1 to its substrate, APP. This change in accessibility is mediated by clustering in lipid rafts, followed by rapid endocytosis.

21258392|t|Ion mobility-mass spectrometry reveals a conformational conversion from random assembly to beta-sheet in amyloid fibril formation.
21258392|a|Amyloid cascades that lead to peptide beta-sheet fibrils and plaques are central to many important diseases. Recently, intermediate assemblies of these cascades were identified as the toxic agents that interact with cellular machinery. The location and cause of the transformation from a natively unstructured assembly to the beta-sheet oligomers found in all fibrils is important in understanding disease onset and the development of therapeutic agents. Largely, research on this early oligomeric region was unsuccessful because all the traditional techniques measure only the average oligomer properties of the ensemble. We utilized ion-mobility methods to deduce the peptide self-assembly mechanism and examined a series of amyloid-forming peptides clipped from larger peptides or proteins associated with disease. We provide unambiguous evidence for structural transitions in each of these fibril-forming peptide systems and establish the potential of this method for the development of therapeutic agents and drug evaluation.

21259015|t|Perivascular drainage of solutes is impaired in the ageing mouse brain and in the presence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
21259015|a|The deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides in the walls of leptomeningeal and cortical blood vessels as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is present in normal ageing and the majority of Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. The failure of clearance mechanisms to eliminate Abeta from the brain contributes to the development of sporadic CAA and AD. Here, we investigated the effects of CAA and ageing on the pattern of perivascular drainage of solutes in the brains of naive mice and in the Tg2576 mouse model of AD. We report that drainage of small molecular weight dextran along cerebrovascular basement membranes is impaired in the hippocampal capillaries and arteries of 22-month-old wild-type mice compared to 3- and 7-month-old animals, which was associated with age-dependent changes in capillary density. Age-related alterations in the levels of laminin, fibronectin and perlecan in vascular basement membranes were also noted in wild-type mice. Furthermore, dextran was observed in the walls of veins of Tg2576 mice in the presence of CAA, suggesting that deposition of Abeta in vessel walls disrupts the normal route of elimination of solutes from the brain parenchyma. These data support the hypothesis that perivascular solute drainage from the brain is altered both in the ageing brain and as a consequence of CAA. These findings have implications for the success of therapeutic strategies for the treatment of AD that rely upon the health of the ageing cerebral vasculature.

21262324|t|Inhibition of beta-amyloid1-42 internalization attenuates neuronal death by stabilizing the endosomal-lysosomal system in rat cortical cultured neurons.
21262324|a|A number of recent studies have indicated that accumulation of beta amyloid (Abeta) peptides within neurons is an early event which may trigger degeneration of neurons and subsequent development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. However, very little is known about the internalization and/or subcellular sites involved in trafficking of Abeta peptides into the neurons that are vulnerable in AD pathology. To address this issue we evaluated internalization of fluoroscein conjugated Abeta1-42 (FAbeta1-42) and subsequent alteration of endosomal-lysosomal (EL) markers such as cathepsin D, Rab5 and Rab7 in rat cortical cultured neurons. It is evident from our results that internalization of FAbeta1-42, which occurred in a dose- and time-dependent manner, triggered degeneration of neurons along with increased levels and/or altered distribution of cathepsin D, Rab5 and Rab7. Our results further revealed that FAbeta1-42 internalization was attenuated by phenylarsine oxide (a general inhibitor of endocytosis) and sucrose (an inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis) but not by antagonists of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors. Additionally, inhibition of FAbeta1-42 endocytosis not only protected neurons against toxicity but also reversed the altered levels/distributions of EL markers. These results, taken together, suggest that internalization of exogenous Abeta1-42, which is partly mediated via a clathrin-dependent process, can lead to degeneration of neurons, possibly by activating the EL system. Inhibition of FAbeta endocytosis attenuated toxicity, thus suggesting a potential strategy for preventing loss of neurons in AD pathology.

21263193|t|Antidepressants modulate intracellular amyloid peptide species in N2a neuroblastoma cells.
21263193|a|It is estimated that 30%-50% of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients are diagnosed with major or minor depression. Research that addresses the relationship between these two diseases will benefit patients who suffer from depression comorbid with AD and allow further understanding of the neuroanatomy of depression. A clinical study showed that the use of the antidepressant fluoxetin concomitantly with the FDA-approved AD drug rivastigmine provided an improvement in the daily activities and the overall functioning in the patients with cognitive impairment. In an attempt to understand the underlying mechanism for the antidepressant's beneficial effect in AD patients, we evaluated the effects of different classes of antidepressants on the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) species in N2a neuroblastoma cells overexpressing amyloid-beta protein precursor. The effect of increasing antidepressant concentrations on the intracellular and secreted Abeta species is investigated by Western blotting. The tested antidepressants include fluoxetine, paroxetine, maprotiline, and imipramine. Fluoxetine and paroxetine at 10 muM significantly decreased the intracellular level of Abeta oligomers and increased the level of Abeta monomers. However, imipramine and maprotiline increased the intracellular amount of Abeta monomers without affecting Abeta oligomers. Based on these results, it is possible that fluoxetine and paroxetine could be beneficial to AD patients via reducing the level of the cytotoxic oligomers and keeping the Abeta peptide in the monomeric form. These data could explain some of the beneficial effects of antidepressants in AD patients observed in clinical studies.

21266456|t|APP-dependent up-regulation of Ptch1 underlies proliferation impairment of neural precursors in Down syndrome.
21266456|a|Mental retardation in Down syndrome (DS) appears to be related to severe neurogenesis impairment during critical phases of brain development. Recent lines of evidence in the cerebellum of a mouse model for DS (the Ts65Dn mouse) have shown a defective responsiveness to Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), a potent mitogen that controls cell division during brain development, suggesting involvement of the Shh pathway in the neurogenesis defects of DS. Based on these premises, we sought to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying derangement of the Shh pathway in neural precursor cells (NPCs) from Ts65Dn mice. By using an in vitro model of NPCs obtained from the subventricular zone and hippocampus, we found that trisomic NPCs had an increased expression of the Shh receptor Patched1 (Ptch1), a membrane protein that suppresses the action of a second receptor, Smoothened (Smo), thereby maintaining the pathway in a repressed state. Partial silencing of Ptch1 expression in trisomic NPCs restored cell proliferation, indicating that proliferation impairment was due to Ptch1 overexpression. The overexpression of Ptch1 in trisomic NPCs resulted from increased levels of AICD [a transcription-promoting fragment of amyloid precursor protein (APP)] and increased AICD binding to the Ptch1 promoter. Our data provide novel evidence that Ptch1 overexpression underlies derangement of the Shh pathway in trisomic NPCs with consequent proliferation impairment. The demonstration that Ptch1 overexpression in trisomic NPCs is due to an APP fragment provides a link between this trisomic gene and the defective neuronal production that characterizes the DS brain.

21266538|t|High ability of apolipoprotein E4 to stabilize amyloid-beta peptide oligomers, the pathological entities responsible for Alzheimer's disease.
21266538|a|Nowadays, the emerging role of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) oligomers in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is widely accepted, putting aside the old idea that fibrils are the primary entities responsible for the onset of the disease. Besides, carrying the E4 isoform of apolipoprotein E (apoE) represents the highest risk of developing AD. Nevertheless, the involvement of apoE4 in AD remains confusing. The goal of this study was to bring new insights into the role of apoE4 in Abeta aggregation. We used infrared spectroscopy, thioflavin T fluorescence, and Western blots to evaluate the influence of apoE isoforms on Abeta aggregation in vitro. Comparing Abeta controls with Abeta incubated either with the apoE3 or apoE4 isoform, we report a 30% reduction of the Abeta fibrillar content, whereas the oligomeric content is 2 times higher on incubation with the pathological isoform apoE4. ApoE4 would bind and block Abeta in its oligomeric conformation, inhibiting further formation of less toxic fibrillar forms of Abeta. While previous studies mostly correlated E4 with fibrils, our report underlines a link between apoE4 and Abeta oligomers and therefore reconciles apoE4 with the new amyloid cascade hypothesis. Our observations suggest that apoE4 strongly stabilizes Abeta oligomers, the pathological species responsible for Alzheimer's disease.

21267651|t|A novel approach for characterization of cathepsin D protease and its effect on tau and beta-amyloid proteins.
21267651|a|Cathepsin D is the lysosomal protease abundantly expressed in the brain. It plays an important role in the regulation of cellular apoptosis. In addition, cathepsin D has been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease and autism. In this study, we developed a novel approach for the preparation of highly purified cathepsin D from the calf brain. This high grade purification is achieved by using DEAE-Sephacel Chromatography before the final step of applying to the Pepstatin-Sepharose 4B column. The properties of cathepsin D have also been studied. We show that cathepsin D cleaves both tau and beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP). Both tau and APP are involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Our findings strongly suggest a link between the lysosomal dysfunction of cathepsin D and the etiology of Alzheimer's disease. Our findings also indicate that cathepsin D could be a new approach to treating Alzheimer's disease.

21268584|t|A kinetic aggregation assay allowing selective and sensitive amyloid-beta quantification in cells and tissues.
21268584|a|The process of amyloid-beta (Abeta) fibril formation is genetically and pathologically linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, a selective and sensitive method for quantifying Abeta fibrils in complex biological samples allows a variety of hypotheses to be tested. Herein, we report the basis for a quantitative in vitro kinetic aggregation assay that detects seeding-competent Abeta aggregates in mammalian cell culture media, in Caenorhabditis elegans lysate, and in mouse brain homogenate. Sonicated, proteinase K-treated Abeta fibril-containing tissue homogenates or cell culture media were added to an initially monomeric Abeta(1-40) reporter peptide to seed an in vitro nucleated aggregation reaction. The reduction in the half-time (t(50)) of the amyloid growth phase is proportional to the quantity of seeding-competent Abeta aggregates present in the biological sample. An ion-exchange resin amyloid isolation strategy from complex biological samples is demonstrated as an alternative for improving the sensitivity and linearity of the kinetic aggregation assay.

21272962|t|Herpes simplex virus type I induces the accumulation of intracellular beta-amyloid in autophagic compartments and the inhibition of the non-amyloidogenic pathway in human neuroblastoma cells.
21272962|a|Mounting evidence suggests that herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Epidemiological analyses have shown that HSV-1 is a risk factor for AD in people with at least 1 type 4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene. Recent studies have also suggested that HSV-1 contributes to the appearance of the biochemical anomalies characteristic of AD brains. In addition, autophagic activity appears to be reduced with aging, and the final stages of autophagy in neurodegenerative process appear to be impaired. The present work reports that HSV-1 provokes the strong intracellular accumulation of both the main species of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in the autophagic compartments and that it is associated with a marked inhibition of Abeta secretion. Autophagosomes containing Abeta failed to fuse with lysosomes in HSV-1-infected cells, indicating the impaired degradation of Abeta localized in the autophagic vesicles. In addition, HSV-1 infection was associated with the inhibition of the nonamyloidogenic pathway of amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing without significantly affecting the activity of the secretases involved in the amyloidogenic pathway. Taken together, these data suggest that HSV-1 infection modulates autophagy and amyloid precursor protein processing, contributing to the accumulation of Abeta characteristic of AD.

21273420|t|CD45 deficiency drives amyloid-beta peptide oligomers and neuronal loss in Alzheimer's disease mice.
21273420|a|Converging lines of evidence indicate dysregulation of the key immunoregulatory molecule CD45 (also known as leukocyte common antigen) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We report that transgenic mice overproducing amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) but deficient in CD45 (PSAPP/CD45(-/-) mice) faithfully recapitulate AD neuropathology. Specifically, we find increased abundance of cerebral intracellular and extracellular soluble oligomeric and insoluble Abeta, decreased plasma soluble Abeta, increased abundance of microglial neurotoxic cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta, and neuronal loss in PSAPP/CD45(-/-) mice compared with CD45-sufficient PSAPP littermates (bearing mutant human amyloid precursor protein and mutant human presenilin-1 transgenes). After CD45 ablation, in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate an anti-Abeta phagocytic but proinflammatory microglial phenotype. This form of microglial activation occurs with elevated Abeta oligomers and neural injury and loss as determined by decreased ratio of anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL to proapoptotic Bax, increased activated caspase-3, mitochondrial dysfunction, and loss of cortical neurons in PSAPP/CD45(-/-) mice. These data show that deficiency in CD45 activity leads to brain accumulation of neurotoxic Abeta oligomers and validate CD45-mediated microglial clearance of oligomeric Abeta as a novel AD therapeutic target.

21274957|t|Copper(I) and copper(II) inhibit Abeta peptides proteolysis by insulin-degrading enzyme differently: implications for metallostasis alteration in Alzheimer's disease.
21274957|a|Accumulation of neurotoxic amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) and alteration of metal homeostasis (metallostasis) in the brain are two main factors that have been very often associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta is constantly produced from the amyloidprecursor-protein APP precursor and immediately catabolized under normal conditions, whereas dysmetabolism of Abeta and/or metal ions seems to lead to a pathological deposition. Although insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) is the main metalloprotease involved in Abeta degradation in the brain being up-regulated in some areas of AD brains, the role of IDE for the onset and development of AD is far from being understood. Moreover, the biomolecular mechanisms involved in the recognition and interaction between IDE and its substrates are still obscure. In spite of the important role of metals (such as copper, aluminum, and zinc), which has brought us to propose a "metal hypothesis of AD", a targeted study of the effect of metallostasis on IDE activity has never been carried out. In this work, we have investigated the role that various metal ions (i.e., Cu(2+), Cu(+), Zn(2+), Ag(+), and Al(3+)) play in modulating the interaction between IDE and two Abeta peptide fragments, namely Abeta(1-16) and Abeta(16-28). It was therefore possible to identify the direct effect that such metal ions have on IDE structure and enzymatic activity without interferences caused by metal-induced substrate modifications. Mass spectrometry and kinetic studies revealed that, among all the metal ions tested, only Cu(2+), Cu(+), and Ag(+) have an inhibitory effect on IDE activity. Moreover, the inhibition of copper(II) is reversed by adding zinc(II), whereas the monovalent cations affect the enzyme activity irreversibly. The molecular basis of their action on the enzyme is also discussed on the basis of computational investigations.

21277971|t|Activity-induced dendrite and dendritic spine development in human amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice.
21277971|a|The amyloid precursor protein is essential for proper neuronal function but an imbalance in processing or metabolism or its overexpression lead to severe malfunction of the brain. The present study focused on dendritic morphology of hippocampal neurons in mice overexpressing the wild-type human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP). In addition, we examined whether enhanced physical activity may affect hAPP-related morphological changes. Overexpression of hAPP resulted in significant enlargement of dendrites, especially within the basal dendritic field but had no effect on spine density. Enhanced physical activity only moderately potentiated hAPP induced changes in dendritic size. Physical activity dependent increases in spine density were, however, augmented by hAPP overexpression. The results suggest that enhanced levels of wild-type hAPP do not result in degenerative changes of neuronal morphology, but rather promote dendritic growth.

21280075|t|SORCS1 alters amyloid precursor protein processing and variants may increase Alzheimer's disease risk.
21280075|a|OBJECTIVE: Sorting mechanisms that cause the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the beta-secretases and gamma-secretases to colocalize in the same compartment play an important role in the regulation of Abeta production in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We and others have reported that genetic variants in the Sortilin-related receptor (SORL1) increased the risk of AD, that SORL1 is involved in trafficking of APP, and that underexpression of SORL1 leads to overproduction of Abeta. Here we explored the role of one of its homologs, the sortilin-related VPS10 domain containing receptor 1 (SORCS1), in AD. METHODS: We analyzed the genetic associations between AD and 16 SORCS1-single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 6 independent data sets (2,809 cases and 3,482 controls). In addition, we compared SorCS1 expression levels of affected and unaffected brain regions in AD and control brains in microarray gene expression and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) sets, explored the effects of significant SORCS1-SNPs on SorCS1 brain expression levels, and explored the effect of suppression and overexpression of the common SorCS1 isoforms on APP processing and Abeta generation. RESULTS: Inherited variants in SORCS1 were associated with AD in all datasets (0.001 < p < 0.049). In addition, SorCS1 influenced APP processing. While overexpression of SorCS1 reduced gamma-secretase activity and Abeta levels, the suppression of SorCS1 increased gamma-secretase processing of APP and the levels of Abeta. INTERPRETATIONS: These data suggest that inherited or acquired changes in SORCS1 expression or function may play a role in the pathogenesis of AD.

21280087|t|gamma-Secretase component presenilin is important for microglia beta-amyloid clearance.
21280087|a|OBJECTIVE: The cleavage of amyloid precursor protein by gamma-secretase is an important aspect of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. gamma-Secretase also cleaves other membrane proteins (eg, Notch), which control cell development and homeostasis. Presenilin 1 and 2 are considered important determinants of the gamma-secretase catalytic site. Our aim was to investigate whether gamma-secretase can be important for microglial phagocytosis of Alzheimer's disease beta-amyloid. METHODS: We investigated the role of gamma-secretase in microglia activity toward beta-amyloid phagocytosis in cell culture using gamma-secretase inhibitors and small hairpin RNA and presenilin-deficient mice. RESULTS: We found that gamma-secretase inhibitors impair microglial activity as measured in gene expression, protein levels, and migration ability, which resulted in a reduction of soluble beta-amyloid phagocytosis. Moreover, microglia deficient in presenilin 1 and 2 showed impairment in phagocytosis of soluble beta-amyloid. Dysfunction in the gamma-secretase catalytic site led to an impairment in clearing insoluble beta-amyloid from brain sections taken from an Alzheimer's disease mouse model when compared to microglia from wild-type mice. INTERPRETATION: We suggest for the first time, a dual role for gamma-secretase in Alzheimer's disease. One role is the cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein for pathologic beta-amyloid production and the other is to regulate microglia activity that is important for clearing neurotoxic beta-amyloid deposits. Further studies of gamma-secretase-mediated cellular pathways in microglia may provide useful insights into the development of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, providing future avenues for therapeutic intervention.

21281586|t|Evidence from solid-state NMR for nonhelical conformations in the transmembrane domain of the amyloid precursor protein.
21281586|a|The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is subject to proteolytic processing by gamma-secretase within neuronal membranes, leading to Alzheimer's disease-associated beta-amyloid peptide production by cleavage near the midpoint of the single transmembrane (TM) segment of APP. Conformational properties of the TM segment may affect its susceptibility to gamma-secretase cleavage, but these properties have not been established definitively, especially in bilayer membranes with physiologically relevant lipid compositions. In this article, we report an investigation of the APP-TM conformation, using (13)C chemical shifts obtained with two-dimensional solid-state NMR spectroscopy as site-specific conformational probes. We find that the APP-TM conformation is not a simple alpha-helix, particularly at 37 C in multilamellar vesicles with compositions that mimic the composition of neuronal cell membranes. Instead, we observe a mixture of helical and nonhelical conformations at the N- and C-termini and in the vicinity of the gamma-cleavage site. Conformational plasticity of the TM segment of APP may be an important factor in the gamma-secretase cleavage mechanism.

21281631|t|Effects of sex hormones on Alzheimer's disease-associated beta-amyloid oligomer formation in vitro.
21281631|a|The folding of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) into oligomeric, protofibrillar, and fibrillar assemblies is hypothesized to be the key pathogenic event in Alzheimer's disease (AD), with oligomeric assemblies thought to be the most neurotoxic. Inhibitors of oligomer formation, therefore, could be valuable therapeutics for patients with AD. Epidemiological studies have indicated that estrogen therapy reduces the risk of developing AD in women. Here, we examined the effects of estrogen (estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), and estriol (E3)) and related sexual steroids (androstenedione (AND) and testosterone (TES)) on the in vitro oligomer formation of Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) using a method of photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins (PICUP) and electron microscopic studies. Estrogens (E1, E2, and E3) inhibited low-order Abeta oligomer formation, and among them, E3 had the strongest in vitro activity. Estrogen could be a potential therapeutic agent to prevent or delay AD progression, and further understanding of the fact that these very similar molecules have different anti-oligomeric effects would contribute to the development of new agents.

21282074|t|Transforming cerebrospinal fluid Abeta42 measures into calculated Pittsburgh Compound B units of brain Abeta amyloid.
21282074|a|BACKGROUND: Positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging of amyloid with Pittsburgh Compound B (PIB) and Abeta42 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF Abeta42) demonstrate a highly significant inverse correlation. Both these techniques are presumed to measure brain Abeta amyloid load. The objectives of this study were to develop a method to transform CSF Abeta42 measures into calculated PIB measures (PIBcalc) of Abeta amyloid load, and to partially validate the method in an independent sample of subjects. METHODS: In all, 41 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) underwent PIB PET imaging and lumbar puncture (LP) at the same time. This sample, referred to as the "training" sample (nine cognitively normal subjects, 22 subjects with mild cognitive impairment, and 10 subjects with Alzheimer's disease), was used to develop a regression model by which CSF Abeta42 (with apolipoprotein E e4 carrier status as a covariate) was transformed into units of PIB PET (PIBcalc). An independent "supporting" sample of 362 ADNI subjects (105 cognitively normal subjects, 164 subjects with mild cognitive impairment, and 93 subjects with Alzheimer's disease) who underwent LP but not PIB PET imaging had their CSF Abeta42 values converted to PIBcalc. These values were compared with the overall PIB PET distribution found in the ADNI subjects (n=102). RESULTS: A linear regression model demonstrates good prediction of actual PIB PET from CSF Abeta42 measures obtained in the training sample (R(2)=0.77, P<.001). PIBcalc data (derived from CSF Abeta42) in the supporting sample of 362 ADNI subjects who underwent LP but not PIB PET imaging demonstrate group-wise distributions that are highly consistent with the larger ADNI PIB PET distribution and with published PIB PET imaging studies. CONCLUSION: Although the precise parameters of this model are specific for the ADNI sample, we conclude that CSF Abeta42 can be transformed into PIBcalc measures of Abeta amyloid load. Brain Abeta amyloid load can be ascertained at baseline in therapeutic or observational studies by either CSF or amyloid PET imaging and the data can be pooled using well-established multiple imputation techniques that account for the uncertainty in a CSF-based PIBcalc value.

21285369|t|Presenilin 2 modulates endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria interactions and Ca2+ cross-talk.
21285369|a|Presenilin mutations are the main cause of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). Presenilins also play a key role in Ca(2+) homeostasis, and their FAD-linked mutants affect cellular Ca(2+) handling in several ways. We previously have demonstrated that FAD-linked presenilin 2 (PS2) mutants decrease the Ca(2+) content of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by inhibiting sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) activity and increasing ER Ca(2+) leak. Here we focus on the effect of presenilins on mitochondrial Ca(2+) dynamics. By using genetically encoded Ca(2+) indicators specifically targeted to mitochondria (aequorin- and GFP-based probes) in SH-SY5Y cells and primary neuronal cultures, we show that overexpression or down-regulation of PS2, but not of presenilin 1 (PS1), modulates the Ca(2+) shuttling between ER and mitochondria, with its FAD mutants strongly favoring Ca(2+) transfer between the two organelles. This effect is not caused by a direct PS2 action on mitochondrial Ca(2+)-uptake machinery but rather by an increased physical interaction between ER and mitochondria that augments the frequency of Ca(2+) hot spots generated at the cytoplasmic surface of the outer mitochondrial membrane upon stimulation. This PS2 function adds further complexity to the multifaceted nature of presenilins and to their physiological role within the cell. We also discuss the importance of this additional effect of FAD-linked PS2 mutants for the understanding of FAD pathogenesis.

21287268|t|Abeta peptide toxicity is reduced after treatments decreasing phosphatidylethanolamine content in differentiated neuroblastoma cells.
21287268|a|We investigated whether the toxicity of oligomeric amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta1-42) upon differentiated human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, can be affected by changes of membrane lipid composition. An immunostaining technique, using lipids extracted from the cells and separated by thin layer chromatography, suggested that Abeta preferentially binds to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), one of the major lipids in the cell extract. For this reason, we utilized treatments with putative inhibitors of phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis (choline, phosphocholine, R59949) to decrease its proportion in the cell membrane; choline treatment (2.5 mM, 24 h) showed the best performance, reducing phosphatidylethanolamine content from 5.7 to 3.3 mug phosphorous/mg protein. Either the extent of Abeta binding or its toxicity decreased onto choline-treated cells. These data may open the possibility to develop future strategies aiming to reduce Abeta toxicity in Alzheimer disease.

21287270|t|Lipoxygenases and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in amyloid beta cytotoxicity.
21287270|a|The 12/15-lipoxygenase(s) (LOX), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP-1) activity and mitochondrial apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) protein in the amyloid beta (Abeta) toxicity were investigated in PC12 cells that express either wild-type (APPwt) or double Swedish mutation (APPsw) forms of human Abeta precursor protein. Different levels of Abeta secretion and free radicals formation characterize these cells. The results demonstrated a relationship between the Abeta levels and LOX protein expression and activity. High Abeta concentration in APPsw cells correlated with a significant increase in free radicals and LOX activation, which leads to translocation of p65/NF-kappaB into the nucleus. An increase in AIF expression in mitochondria was observed concurrently with inhibition of PARP-1 activity in the nuclear fraction of APPsw cells. We suggested that AIF accumulation in mitochondria may be involved in adaptive/protective processes. However, inhibition of PARP-1 may be responsible for the disturbances in transcription and DNA repair as well as the degeneration of APP cells. Under conditions of increased nitrosative stress, evoked by the nitric oxide donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP, 0.5 mM), 70-80% of all cells types died after 24 h, significantly more in APPsw cells. There was no further significant change in mitochondrial AIF level and PARP-1 activity compared to corresponding non-treated cells. Only one exception was observed in PC12 control, where SNP significantly inhibits PARP-1 activity. Moreover, SNP significantly activated gene expression for 12/15-LOX in all types of investigated cells. Inhibitors of all LOX isoforms and specific inhibitor of 12-LOX enhanced the survival of cells that were subjected to SNP. We conclude that the LOX pathways may play a role in Abeta toxicity and in nitrosative-stress-induced cell death and that inhibition of these pathways offers novel protective strategies.

21288003|t|Hydrophobic, aromatic, and electrostatic interactions play a central role in amyloid fibril formation and stability.
21288003|a|Amyloid-like fibrous crystals formed by the peptide KFFEAAAKKFFE have been previously characterized and provide an ideal model system to examine the importance of specific interactions by introducing specific substitutions. We find that the removal of any phenylalanine residue completely abrogates assembly ability, while charged residues modulate interactions within the structure resulting in alternative fibrillar morphologies. X-ray fiber diffraction analysis reveals that the essential backbone packing of the peptide molecules is maintained, while small changes accommodate differences in side chain size in the variants. We conclude that even very short peptides are adaptable and add to the growing knowledge regarding amyloid polymorphisms. Additionally, this work impacts on our understanding of the importance of residue composition for amyloidogenic peptides, in particular the roles of electrostatic, aromatic, and hydrophobic interactions in amyloid assembly.

21289173|t|Heparan sulphate proteoglycan and the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 constitute major pathways for neuronal amyloid-beta uptake.
21289173|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative disorder in which the aggregation and deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides in the brain are central to its pathogenesis. In healthy brains, Abeta is effectively metabolized with little accumulation. Cellular uptake and subsequent degradation of Abeta is one of the major pathways for its clearance in the brain. Increasing evidence has demonstrated significant roles for the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) in the metabolism of Abeta in neurons, glia cells, and along the brain vasculatures. Heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) has also been implicated in several pathogenic features of AD, including its colocalization with amyloid plaques. Here, we demonstrate that HSPG and LRP1 cooperatively mediate cellular Abeta uptake. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter and confocal microscopy revealed that knockdown of LRP1 suppresses Abeta uptake, whereas overexpression of LRP1 enhances this process in neuronal cells. Heparin, which antagonizes HSPG, significantly inhibited cellular Abeta uptake. Importantly, treatment with heparin or heparinase blocked LRP1-mediated cellular uptake of Abeta. We further showed that HSPG is more important for the binding of Abeta to the cell surface than LRP1. The critical roles of HSPG in cellular Abeta binding and uptake were confirmed in Chinese hamster ovary cells genetically deficient in HSPG. We also showed that heparin and a neutralizing antibody to LRP1 suppressed Abeta uptake in primary neurons. Our findings demonstrate that LRP1 and HSPG function in a cooperative manner to mediate cellular Abeta uptake and define a major pathway through which Abeta gains entry to neuronal cells.

21289177|t|Tau protein is required for amyloid {beta}-induced impairment of hippocampal long-term potentiation.
21289177|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) and tau protein are both implicated in memory impairment, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and early Alzheimer's disease (AD), but whether and how they interact is unknown. Consequently, we asked whether tau protein is required for the robust phenomenon of Abeta-induced impairment of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), a widely accepted cellular model of memory. We used wild-type mice and mice with a genetic knock-out of tau protein and recorded field potentials in an acute slice preparation. We demonstrate that the absence of tau protein prevents Abeta-induced impairment of LTP. Moreover, we show that Abeta increases tau phosphorylation and that a specific inhibitor of the tau kinase glycogen synthase kinase 3 blocks the increased tau phosphorylation induced by Abeta and prevents Abeta-induced impairment of LTP in wild-type mice. Together, these findings show that tau protein is required for Abeta to impair synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and suggest that the Abeta-induced impairment of LTP is mediated by tau phosphorylation. We conclude that preventing the interaction between Abeta and tau could be a promising strategy for treating cognitive impairment in MCI and early AD.

21289194|t|Sphingolipid storage affects autophagic metabolism of the amyloid precursor protein and promotes Abeta generation.
21289194|a|Deposition of amyloid beta peptides (Abetas) in extracellular amyloid plaques within the human brain is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta derives from proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretases. The initial cleavage by beta-secretase results in shedding of the APP ectodomain and generation of APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs), which can then be further processed within the transmembrane domain by gamma-secretase, resulting in release of Abeta. Here, we demonstrate that accumulation of sphingolipids (SLs), as occurs in lysosomal lipid storage disorders (LSDs), decreases the lysosome-dependent degradation of APP-CTFs and stimulates gamma-secretase activity. Together, this results in increased generation of both intracellular and secreted Abeta. Notably, primary fibroblasts from patients with different SL storage diseases show strong accumulation of potentially amyloidogenic APP-CTFs. By using biochemical, cell biological, and genetic approaches, we demonstrate that SL accumulation affects autophagic flux and impairs the clearance of APP-CTFs. Thus, accumulation of SLs might not only underlie the pathogenesis of LSDs, but also trigger increased generation of Abeta and contribute to neurodegeneration in sporadic AD.

21290543|t|Bacterial inclusion bodies of Alzheimer's disease beta-amyloid peptides can be employed to study native-like aggregation intermediate states.
21290543|a|The structures of oligomeric intermediate states in the aggregation process of Alzheimer's disease beta-amyloid peptides have been the subject of debate for many years. Bacterial inclusion bodies contain large amounts of small heat shock proteins (sHSPs), which are highly homologous to those found in the plaques of the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. sHSPs break down amyloid fibril structure in vitro and induce oligomeric assemblies. Prokaryotic protein overexpression thus mimics the conditions encountered in the cell under stress and allows the structures of Abeta aggregation intermediate states to be investigated under native-like conditions, which is not otherwise technically possible. We show that IB40/IB42 fulfil all the requirements to be classified as amyloids: they seed fibril growth, are Congo red positive and show characteristic beta-sheet-rich CD spectra. However, IB40 and IB42 are much less stable than fibrils formed in vitro and contain significant amounts of non-beta-sheet regions, as seen from FTIR studies. Quantitative analyses of solution-state NMR H/D exchange rates show that the hydrophobic cores involving residues V18-F19-F20 adopt beta-sheet conformations, whereas the C termini adopt alpha-helical coiled-coil structures. In the past, an alpha-helical intermediate-state structure has been postulated, but could not be verified experimentally. In agreement with the current literature, in which Abeta oligomers are described as the most toxic state of the peptides, we find that IB42 contains SDS-resistant oligomers that are more neurotoxic than Abeta42 fibrils. E. coli inclusion bodies formed by the Alzheimer's disease beta-amyloid peptides Abeta40 and Abeta42 thus behave structurally like amyloid aggregation intermediate states and open the possibility of studying amyloids in a native-like, cellular environment.

21292768|t|Two distinct amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) assembly pathways leading to oligomers and fibrils identified by combined fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, morphology, and toxicity analyses.
21292768|a|Nonfibrillar assemblies of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) are considered to play primary roles in Alzheimer disease (AD). Elucidating the assembly pathways of these specific aggregates is essential for understanding disease pathogenesis and developing knowledge-based therapies. However, these assemblies cannot be monitored in vivo, and there has been no reliable in vitro monitoring method at low protein concentration. We have developed a highly sensitive in vitro monitoring method using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) combined with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and toxicity assays. Using Abeta labeled at the N terminus or Lys(16), we uncovered two distinct assembly pathways. One leads to highly toxic 10-15-nm spherical Abeta assemblies, termed amylospheroids (ASPDs). The other leads to fibrils. The first step in ASPD formation is trimerization. ASPDs of ~330 kDa in mass form from these trimers after 5 h of slow rotation. Up to at least 24 h, ASPDs remain the dominant structures in assembly reactions. Neurotoxicity studies reveal that the most toxic ASPDs are ~128 kDa (~32-mers). In contrast, fibrillogenesis begins with dimer formation and then proceeds to formation of 15-40-nm spherical intermediates, from which fibrils originate after 15 h. Unlike ASPD formation, the Lys(16)-labeled peptide disturbed fibril formation because the Abeta(16-20) region is critical for this final step. These differences in the assembly pathways clearly indicated that ASPDs are not fibril precursors. The method we have developed should facilitate identifying Abeta assembly steps at which inhibition may be beneficial.

21293490|t|Mediator is a transducer of amyloid-precursor-protein-dependent nuclear signalling.
21293490|a|Regulated intramembrane proteolysis of the amyloid precursor-protein (APP) produces both a characterstic amyloid-beta peptide that contributes to neuritic plaque formation and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer disease and a small APP intracellular domain (AICD) that transcriptionally activates genes implicated in Alzheimer disease pathology. Although the biochemical events leading to amyloidogenic APP processing at the cell membrane have been described in detail, comparably little is known about the mechanistic basis of AICD-dependent gene regulation in the nucleus. In this study, we show that the AICD activates transcription by targeting MED12, an RNA polymerase II transcriptional Mediator subunit that is implicated in human cognitive development. The AICD binds to MED12/Mediator in vitro and in vivo. Disruption of the AICD/MED12 interaction inhibits AICD transactivation potential and expression of AICD target genes. Mediator, in a MED12-dependent manner, occupies only AICD-bound promoter DNA, indicating that the AICD recruits Mediator to activate transcription. These results identify the MED12 interface in Mediator as a crucial transducer of AICD transactivation and a potential therapeutic target in Alzheimer disease.

21293924|t|Dietary supplementation with tBHQ, an Nrf2 stabilizer molecule, confers neuroprotection against apoptosis in amyloid beta-injected rat.
21293924|a|Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) coordinates the up-regulation of cytoprotective genes via the antioxidant response element (ARE). There is significant evidence that oxidative stress is a critical event in the pathogenesis of AD. Considering the protective role of Nrf2 against oxidative injury, we studied to determine whether in vivo toxicity of amyloid beta (Abeta) can be attenuated by tBHQ, an Nrf2 stabilizer, Using an Abeta injection model. We demonstrated that pre-activation of endogenous Nrf2 by tBHQ attenuated Abeta-induced caspase-3 expression. tBHQ enhanced GSH, decreased MDA level, and inhibited NF-kappaB. This investigation provides the first documentation of tBHQ's neuroprotective effect through decrease of Abeta accumulation in rat brain. Our results show the involvement of Hsp-70 in this protective effect. In summary tBHQ treatment for 1 week prior to Abeta injection protected against the oxidative damage, apoptosis and Abeta accumulation in rats.

21294162|t|An Alzheimer's disease-relevant presenilin-1 mutation augments amyloid-beta-induced oligodendrocyte dysfunction.
21294162|a|White matter pathology has been documented in the brains of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD)-afflicted individuals during presymptomatic and preclinical stages of AD. How these defects in myelination integrity arise and what roles they may play in AD pathophysiology have yet to be fully elucidated. We previously demonstrated that triple-transgenic AD (3xTg-AD) mice, which harbor the human amyloid precursor Swedish mutation, presenilin-1 M146V (PS1(M146V) ) knock-in mutation, and tau(P301L) mutation, exhibit myelin abnormalities analogous to FAD patients and that Abeta(1-42) contributes to these white matter deficits. Herein, we demonstrate that the PS1(M146V) mutation predisposes mouse oligodendrocyte precursor (mOP) cells to Abeta(1-42) -induced alterations in cell differentiation in vitro. Furthermore, PS1(M146V) expression compromised mOP cell function and MBP protein distribution, a process that is further aggravated with exposure to Abeta(1-42) . We found that the myelination defect and MBP subcellular mislocalization triggered by PS1(M146V) and Abeta(1-42) can be effectively prevented by treatment with the GSK-3beta inhibitor, TWS119, thereby implicating GSK-3beta kinase activity in this pathogenic cascade. Overall, this work provides further mechanistic insights into PS1(M146V) and Abeta(1-42) -driven oligodendrocyte dysfunction andmyelin damage during early presymptomatic stages of AD, and provides a new target in oligodendrocytes for developing therapies designed to avert AD-related white matter pathology.

In 40% of AD cases, Abeta mainly accumulates in cortical capillaries, a phenomenon referred to as capillary CAA (capCAA). The aim of this study was to investigate blood-brain barrier (BBB) alterations in CAA-affected capillaries with the emphasis on tight junction (TJ) changes. First, capCAA brain tissue was analyzed for the distribution of TJs. Here, we show for the first time a dramatic loss of occludin, claudin-5, and ZO-1 in Abeta-laden capillaries surrounded by NADPH oxidase-2 (NOX-2)-positive activated microglia. Importantly, we observed abundant vascular expression of the Abeta transporter receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE). To unravel the underlying mechanism, a human brain endothelial cell line was stimulated with Abeta1-42 to analyze the effects of Abeta. We observed a dose-dependent cytotoxicity and increased ROS generation, which interestingly was reversed by administration of exogenous antioxidants, NOX-2 inhibitors, and by blocking RAGE. Taken together, our data evidently show that Abeta is toxic to brain endothelial cells via binding to RAGE and induction of ROS production, which ultimately leads to disruption of TJs and loss of BBB integrity.

21295028|t|In vitro modelling of Alzheimer's disease: degeneration and cell death induced by viral delivery of amyloid and tau.
21295028|a|With increasing life expectancy, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias pose an increasing and as yet unresolved health problem. A variety of cellular models of AD has helped to decipher some key aspects of amyloid and tau related degeneration. The initial approach of extracellular applications of synthetic peptides has now been replaced by the introduction of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and tau genes. In the present study adenoviral transductions were exploited for gene delivery into primary rat hippocampal and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cultures to enable comparative and mechanistic studies at the cellular level and subsequent drug testing. Time lapse experiments revealed a different pattern of cell death: apoptotic-like for APP whereas tau positive cells joined and formed clusters. Mutated human APP or tau expression caused accelerated neuronal damage and cell death (cf. EGFP: -50% for APP at 5 days; -40% for tau at 3 days). This reduction in viability was preceded by decreased excitability, monitored via responses to depolarising KCl-challenges in Ca(2+) imaging experiments. Additionally, both transgenes reduced neurite outgrowth in DRG neurones. Treatment studies confirmed that APP induced-damage can be ameliorated by beta- and gamma-secretase inhibitors (providing protection to 60-100% of control levels), clioquinol (80%) and lithium (100%); while anti-aggregation treatments were beneficial for tau-induced damage (60-90% recovery towards controls). Interestingly, caffeine was the most promising drug candidate for therapeutic intervention with high efficacy in both APP (77%) and tau-induced models (72% recovery). Overall, these cellular models offer advantages for mechanistic studies and target identification in AD and related disorders.

21295112|t|Region-specific distribution of beta-amyloid peptide and cytokine expression in TgCRND8 mice.
21295112|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial disease that results in progressive neurodegeneration. Brain regions are differentially affected in AD. There is also an age-dependent effect on amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) accumulation and neuroinflammation as disease progresses. In the TgCRND8 APP transgenic mouse model, levels of Abeta species and cytokines were examined as a function of brain region and age. A temporal sequence was observed whereby Abeta accumulation is followed by expression of IL-1beta and eventually, of CXCL1, in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb but not the cortex. We have shown for the first time, in an APP mouse model, age and regional differences in Abeta accumulation and cytokine expression.

21296022|t|Pre-dementia clinical stages in presenilin 1 E280A familial early-onset Alzheimer's disease: a retrospective cohort study.
21296022|a|BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and pre-MCI have been proposed as stages preceding Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. We assessed descendants of individuals with a mutation in presenilin 1 (PSEN1) that causes familial AD, with the aim of identifying distinct stages of clinical progression to AD dementia. METHODS: We retrospectively studied a cohort of descendants of carriers of the PSEN1 E280A mutation. Pre-dementia cognitive impairment was defined by a score 2 SD away from normal values in objective cognitive tests, and was subdivided as follows: asymptomatic pre-MCI was defined by an absence of memory complaints and no effect on activities of daily living; symptomatic pre-MCI was defined by a score on the subjective memory complaints checklist higher than the mean and no effect on activities of daily living; and MCI was defined by a score on the subjective memory complaints checklist higher than the mean, with no effect on basic activities of daily living and little or no effect on complex daily activities. Dementia was defined according to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fourth edition. Reference mean scores were those of participants who did not carry the PSEN1 E280A mutation. We used the Turnbull survival analysis method to identify ages at onset of each stage of the disease. We measured the time from birth until onset of the three pre-dementia stages, dementia, and death, and assessed decline in cognitive domains for each stage. FINDINGS: Follow-up was from Jan 1, 1995, to Jan 27, 2010. 1784 patients were initially identified, 449 of whom were PSEN1 E280A carriers who had complete clinical follow-up. Median age at onset was 35 years (95% CI 30-36) for asymptomatic pre-MCI, 38 years (37-40) for symptomatic pre-MCI, 44 years (43-45) for MCI, and 49 years (49-50) for dementia. The median age at death was 59 years (95% CI 58-61). The median time of progression from asymptomatic to symptomatic pre-MCI was 4 years (95% CI 2-8), from symptomatic pre-MCI to MCI was 6 years (4-7), from MCI to dementia was 5 years (4-6), and from dementia to death was 10 years (9-12). The cognitive profile was predominantly amnestic and was associated with multiple domains. Affected domains showed variability in initial stages, with some transient recovery in symptomatic pre-MCI followed by continuous decline. INTERPRETATION: Clinical deterioration can be detected as measurable cognitive impairment around two decades before dementia onset in PSEN1 E280A carriers. Onset and progression of pre-dementia stages should be considered in the investigation and use of therapeutic interventions for familial AD.

21296884|t|Functional and topological analysis of Pen-2, the fourth subunit of the gamma-secretase complex.
21296884|a|The gamma-secretase complex is a member of the family of intramembrane cleaving proteases, involved in the generation of the Abeta peptides in Alzheimer disease. One of the four subunits of the complex, presenilin, harbors the catalytic site, although the role of the other three subunits is less well understood. Here, we studied the role of the smallest subunit, Pen-2, in vivo and in vitro. We found a profound Notch-deficiency phenotype in Pen-2-/- embryos confirming the essential role of Pen-2 in the gamma-secretase complex. We used Pen-2-/- fibroblasts to investigate the structure-function relation of Pen-2 by the scanning cysteine accessibility method. We showed that glycine 22 and proline 27 in hydrophobic domain 1 of Pen-2 are essential for complex formation and stability of gamma-secretase. We also demonstrated that hydrophobic domain 1 and the loop domain of Pen-2 are located in a water-containing cavity and are in short proximity to the presenilin C-terminal fragment. We finally demonstrated the essential role of Pen-2 for the proteolytic activity of the complex. Our study supports the hypothesis that Pen-2 is more than a structural component of the gamma-secretase complex and may contribute to the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme.

21297255|t|Amyloid-beta-induced amyloid-beta secretion: a possible feed-forward mechanism in Alzheimer's Disease.
21297255|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides, 36-43 amino acids in length, are produced from beta- and gamma-secretase cleavage of the amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP), and are one of the causative agents of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we show that an ELISA can detect total rodent Abeta without interference from physiological concentrations of human Abeta. In cultured dissociated rat cortical neurons and rat and mouse hippocampal organotypic slices, we apply the assay to measure the production of Abeta in response to treatment with hydrogen peroxide, a known stimulator of Abeta secretion, or human Abeta dimer/trimer (Abetad/t), fractionated from the culture medium of 7PA2 cells. Peroxide increases Abeta secretion by about 2 fold, similar to results from previous reports that used a different assay. Of greater significance is that physiologically relevant concentrations (~250 pM) of human Abetad/t increase rodent Abeta secretion from cultured rat cortical neurons by >3 fold over 4 days. Surprisingly, neither treatment with peroxide nor human Abetad/t leads to accumulation of intracellular Abeta. Human Abetad/t increased >2 fold the Abeta secreted by organotypic hippocampal slices from tau knock-out mice whether or not they expressed a human tau transgene, suggesting tau plays no role in enhanced Abeta secretion. Together, these results support an Abeta-mediated feed-forward mechanism in AD progression.

21297260|t|Anti-amnesic and neuroprotective actions of the sigma-1 receptor agonist (-)-MR22 in rats with selective cholinergic lesion and amyloid infusion.
21297260|a|Sigma-1 receptor agonists have recently attracted much attention as potential therapeutic drugs for cognitive and affective disorders, however, it is still unclear whether they act via modulation of transmitter release or activation of sigma-1 receptors in memory-related brain regions. In the present study,we have investigated the anti-amnesic and neuroprotective actions of the compound (-)-methyl (1S,2R)-2-{[1-adamantyl(methyl)amino]methyl}-1-phenylcyclopropane-carboxylate) [(-)-MR22],a selective sigma-1 receptor agonist able to protect cultured cortical neurons from amyloid toxicity. To this aim, cognitive deficits, cholinergic loss, and amyloid peptide accumulation were obtained in the rat by simultaneous injections of a selective immunotoxin and pre-aggregated amyloid peptide into the basal forebrain and the hippocampus, respectively. At about five-six weeks post-lesion, the double-lesioned animals exhibited dramatic deficits in spatial learning and memory, whereas animals with single injections of either compound were not or only marginally affected, in spite of equally severe cholinergic loss oramyloid deposition. Administration of (-)-MR22 appeared to reverse cognitive impairments in double lesioned animals, whereas pre-treatment with the selective sigma-1 antagonist BD1047 abolished this effect. Moreover, (-)-MR22 normalized the levels of cell-associated amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) in the neocortex and hippocampus, thus sustaining a non-amyloidogenic AbetaPP processing. By contrast, treatment with (-)-MR22 produced no effects whatsoever in intact animals. Thus, sigma-1 receptor agonists such as (-)-MR22 may ameliorate perturbed cognitive abilities and exert a protective action onto target neurons, holding promises as viable tools for memory enhancement and neuroprotection.

21297270|t|The flavonoid apigenin protects brain neurovascular coupling against amyloid-beta25-35-induced toxicity in mice.
21297270|a|Apigenin, one of the most common flavonoids, has demonstrated anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic, and free radical-scavenging activities. Recent studies revealed its protective effects against amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced neurotoxicity, but the mechanism was unclear. In the present study, we aimed to explore the anti-amnesic and protective effects of apigenin against Abeta25-35-induced toxicity and the underlying mechanisms in the cerebral cortex in mice. The learning and memory impairments, changes in morphology of major components of neurovascular unit, ultrastructural changes and oxidative stress of cerebral cortex, cerebrovascular dysfunction, and neuronal changes were detected after oral administration of apigenin continuously for 8 days. Our results demonstrate that oral administration of apigenin for Abeta25-35-induced amnesic mice conferred robust neurovascular coupling protection, involving improvement of the learning and memory capabilities, maintenance of neurovascular unit integrity, modulation of microvascular function, reduction of neurovascular oxidative damage, increase of regional cerebral blood flow, improvement of cholinergic system involving the inhibition of AChE activity and elevation of ACh level, and modification of BNDF, TrkB, and phospho-CREB levels.

21300120|t|ACS84, a novel hydrogen sulfide-releasing compound, protects against amyloid beta-induced cell cytotoxicity.
21300120|a|Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) is a novel neurotransmitter. We studied here the effect of ACS 84, a new H(2)S releasing compound, on the cytotoxicity induced by amyloid beta (Abeta) in microglia. Treatment with Abeta(1-40) (25mumol/L) for 24h significantly inhibited MTT reduction and increased lactate dehydrogenase release in BV-2 microglia cells. Pretreatment with ACS 84 (10muM) for 30min attenuated the above cytotoxicity caused by Abeta(1-40), suggesting that ACS 84 may protect microglia against Abeta(1-40)-induced cell injury. ACS 84 also significantly attenuated nitric oxide release and TNF-alpha production in BV-2 cells treated with Abeta peptides (Abeta(1-40) or Abeta(1-42)), but had no significant effect on the up-regulated protein expression of cyclooxygenase 2. These data suggest that ACS 84 may produce anti-inflammatory effect via inhibition of the release of inflammatory cytokines but not via suppression of the prostanoids production. Furthermore, pretreatment with ACS 84 also attenuated mitochondrial membrane potential loss (Deltapsi(m)) caused by Abeta(1-40) in both microglia and neurons. To examine the underlying signaling mechanism, we detected the phosphorylation of p38-, JNK- and ERK-MAPKs. It was found that Abeta(1-40) stimulated phosphorylation of all above three types of MAKPs. However, ACS 84 only attenuated the activation of p38 and JNK, but had no significant effect on that of ERK. Taken together, our data suggest that ACS 84 may protect Abeta-induced cell injury via anti-inflammation and preservation of mitochondrial function in a p38 and JNK dependent mechanism. Our work suggests that ACS 84 may have potential for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

21300137|t|P2 receptor stimulation induces amyloid precursor protein production and secretion in rat cortical astrocytes.
21300137|a|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is ubiquitously expressed in a variety of tissues but is predominantly expressed in the brain. The expression of APP has been well studied in neurons but little is known about its presence in astrocytes. The study presented here shows that purinergic signaling is involved in the production and secretion of APP in primary cultures of rat cortical astrocytes. Extracellular ATP caused an increase in APP production and release in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and was inhibited by antagonists of P2 receptors. Further agonist and antagonist studies revealed involvement of P2Y2 and P2Y4 receptors in nucleotide-stimulated production and release of APP. In addition, signaling studies with various protein kinase inhibitors demonstrated that blockade of mitogen-activated protein kinases, but not Akt, inhibited nucleotide-stimulated APP expression and release. These results indicate that APP production and secretion can be regulated by activation of P2Y2/4 receptors coupled to protein kinase signaling pathways and suggest that astrocytes can be a potential source of APP.

21300794|t|Tissue transglutaminase-mediated glutamine deamidation of beta-amyloid peptide increases peptide solubility, whereas enzymatic cross-linking and peptide fragmentation may serve as molecular triggers for rapid peptide aggregation.
21300794|a|Tissue transglutaminase (TGase) has been implicated in a number of cellular processes and disease states, where the enzymatic actions of TGase may serve in both, cell survival and apoptosis. To date, the precise functional properties of TGase in cell survival or cell death mechanisms still remain elusive. TGase-mediated cross-linking has been reported to account for the formation of insoluble lesions in conformational diseases. We report here that TGase induces intramolecular cross-linking of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta), resulting in structural changes of monomeric Abeta. Using high resolution mass spectrometry (MS) of cross-linked Abeta peptides, we observed a shift in mass, which is, presumably associated with the loss of NH3 due to enzymatic transamidation activity and hence intramolecular peptide cross-linking. We have observed that a large population of Abeta monomers contained an 0.984 Da increase in mass at a glutamine residue, indicating that glutamine 15 serves as an indispensable substrate in TGase-mediated deamidation to glutamate 15. We provide strong analytical evidence on TGase-mediated Abeta peptide dimerization, through covalent intermolecular cross-linking and hence the formation of Abeta1-40 dimers. Our in depth analyses indicate that TGase-induced post-translational modifications of Abeta peptide may serve as an important seed for aggregation.

21300906|t|Structural dependence of HET-s amyloid fibril infectivity assessed by cryoelectron microscopy.
21300906|a|HET-s is a prion protein of the fungus Podospora anserina which, in the prion state, is active in a self/nonself recognition process called heterokaryon incompatibility. Its prionogenic properties reside in the C-terminal "prion domain." The HET-s prion domain polymerizes in vitro into amyloid fibrils whose properties depend on the pH of assembly; above pH 3, infectious singlet fibrils are produced, and below pH 3, noninfectious triplet fibrils. To investigate the correlation between structure and infectivity, we performed cryo-EM analyses. Singlet fibrils have a helical pitch of approximately 410 A and a left-handed twist. Triplet fibrils have three protofibrils whose lateral dimensions (36 x 25 A) and axial packing (one subunit per 9.4 A) match those of singlets but differ in their supercoiling. At 8.5-A resolution, the cross-section of the singlet fibril reconstruction is largely consistent with that of a beta-solenoid model previously determined by solid-state NMR. Reconstructions of the triplet fibrils show three protofibrils coiling around a common axis and packed less tightly at pH 3 than at pH 2, eventually peeling off. Taken together with the earlier observation that fragmentation of triplet fibrils by sonication does not increase infectivity, these observations suggest a novel mechanism for self-propagation, whereby daughter fibrils nucleate on the lateral surface of singlet fibrils. In triplets, this surface is occluded, blocking nucleation and thereby explaining their lack of infectivity.

21303680|t|Monocyte-mediated regulation of genes by the amyloid and prion peptides in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells.
21303680|a|Alzheimer's disease as well as prion-related encephalopathies are neurodegenerative disorders of the central nervous system, which cause mental deterioration and progressive dementia. Both pathologies appear to be primarily associated with the pathological accumulation and deposit of beta-amyloid or prion peptides in the brain, and it has been even suggested that neurotoxicity induced by these peptides would be associated to essentially similar pathogenic mechanisms, in particular to those that follow the activation of microglial cells. To probe whether the neurotoxic effects induced by the beta-amyloid and prion peptides are actually mediated by similar glial-associated mechanisms, we have examined the differential expression of genes in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells incubated with conditioned media from beta-amyloid or prion-stimulated THP-1 monocytic cells. According to microarray analysis, not many coincidences are observed and only four genes (Hint3, Psph, Daam1 and c-Jun) appear to be commonly upregulated by both peptides. Furthermore, c-Jun appears to be involved in the cell death mediated by both peptides.

21303686|t|Yokukansan, a traditional Japanese medicine, ameliorates memory disturbance and abnormal social interaction with anti-aggregation effect of cerebral amyloid beta proteins in amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice.
21303686|a|The deposition of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) is a consistent pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. Therefore, inhibition of Abeta aggregation in the brain is an attractive therapeutic and preventive strategy in the development of disease-modifying drugs for AD. An in vitro study demonstrated that yokukansan (YKS), a traditional Japanese medicine, inhibited Abeta aggregation in a concentration-dependent manner. An in vivo study demonstrated that YKS and Uncaria hook (UH), a constituent of YKS, prevented the accumulation of cerebral Abeta. YKS also improved the memory disturbance and abnormal social interaction such as increased aggressive behavior and decreased social behavior in amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice. These results suggest that YKS is likely to be a potent and novel therapeutic agent to prevent and/or treat AD, and that this may be attributed to UH.

21304182|t|Soluble Abeta(1-40) peptide increases excitatory neurotransmission and induces epileptiform activity in hippocampal neurons.
21304182|a|It is believed that amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), in its aggregated-oligomeric state, constitutes one of the neurotoxic factors involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. With the objective of studying a potential role of the peptide on synaptic transmission, we studied the effect of soluble Abeta(1-40) on synaptic transmission in rat hippocampal neurons. Neurons incubated with 500 nM of Abeta(1-40) peptide for 3 days presented higher levels of intracellular calcium transients, as evaluated by fluorimetric techniques. These effects of Abeta were time and concentration dependent and were accompanied by increases in glutamatergic (0.8+-0.2 Hz to 2.9+-0.6 Hz), but not GABAergic, transmission. The analysis of pharmacologically isolated currents in treated neurons showed increases in both AMPA- and NMDA-mediated currents as compared to control. The effects of the peptide on the frequency of synaptic currents correlated well with increases in the number of SV2 puncta and of FM1-43 destaining, suggesting a presynaptic locus for the peptide. The data also shows that application of either Abeta or bicuculline alone for 24 h was without effects on neurotransmission. However, their co-application induced an increase in synaptic transmission which was accompanied by synchronous discharges reminiscent to those produced by pro-convulsive drugs, such as bicuculline. In conclusion, these results suggest that the soluble form of Abeta(1-40) participates in the regulation of synaptic transmission increasing excitability and producing a pre-epileptogenic state in hippocampal neurons.

21307265|t|p75NTR regulates Abeta deposition by increasing Abeta production but inhibiting Abeta aggregation with its extracellular domain.
21307265|a|Accumulation of toxic amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus is a major pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The neurotrophin receptor p75NTR has been proposed to mediate Abeta-induced neurotoxicity; however, its role in the development of AD remains to be clarified. The p75NTR/ExonIII-/- mice and APPSwe/PS1dE9 mice were crossed to generate transgenic AD mice with deletion of p75NTR gene. In APPSwe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice, p75NTR expression was localized in the basal forebrain neurons and degenerative neurites in neocortex, increased with aging, and further activated by Abeta accumulation. Deletion of the p75NTR gene in APPSwe/PS1dE9 mice reduced soluble Abeta levels in the brain and serum, but increased the accumulation of insoluble Abeta and Abeta plaque formation. There was no change in the levels of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its proteolytic derivatives, or alpha-, beta-, and gamma-secretase activities, or in levels of BACE1, neprilysin (NEP), and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) proteins. Abeta production by cortical neurons of APPSwe/PS1dE9 mice was reduced by deletion of p75NTR gene in vitro. Recombinant extracellular domain of p75NTR attenuated the oligomerization and fibrillation of synthetic Abeta(42) peptide in vitro, and reduced local Abeta plaques after hippocampus injection in vivo. In addition, deletion of p75NTR attenuated microgliosis but increased the microhemorrhage profiles in the brain. The deletion of p75NTR did not significantly change the cognitive function of the mice up to the age of 9 months. Our data suggest that p75NTR plays a critical role in regulating Abeta levels by both increasing Abeta production and attenuating its aggregation, and they caution that a therapeutic intervention simply reducing p75NTR may exacerbate AD pathology.

21307566|t|Production of anti-amyloid beta antibodies in mice fed rice expressing amyloid beta.
21307566|a|The main signs of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are cognitive impairment and senile plaques composed of amyloid beta (Abeta) observed in patients' brains. Therefore, therapy for AD focuses on the removal of Abeta. We developed an "edible vaccine" that employs intestinal immunity with little to no side effects. Rice was utilized as an edible vaccine. It expressed GFP-Abeta42. Abeta rice was administered orally to wild-type (WT) mice causing production of anti-Abeta antibodies. Since Abeta rice was mixed with the cholera toxin B subunit (CTB), antibody against the rice seed protein was also produced. Then, mice were caused to develop immune tolerance against the rice seed protein by oral administration of Abeta rice mixed with CTB. The results indicated that only anti-Abeta antibodies were produced.

21308788|t|Antipsychotic medication is associated with selective alterations in ventricular cerebrospinal fluid Abeta 40 and tau in patients with intractable unipolar depression.
21308788|a|OBJECTIVE: Alterations in plasma and in lumbar cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-B peptide (Abeta) levels have been reported in Alzheimer's disease. Studies have also suggested similar changes in depressed patients. No information is available on the impact of psychotropic drugs on this in patients with depression. We therefore quantified Abeta in ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in a population of patients with treatment-resistant depression, with and without antipsychotic medication. METHOD: A cross-sectional study of 32 patients undergoing subcaudate tractotomy for major (unipolar) depressive disorder. Ventricular CSF concentrations of Abeta peptide 1-40 and 1-42, also p-tau and total tau were determined by Western blotting or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Patients taking antipsychotic medication in the 2 weeks prior to surgery demonstrated significantly higher levels of Abeta 1-40 (mean +- SD: 727.3 +- 382.3 vs. 440.9 +- 337.2 pg/ml; p = 0.032, Student's t-test) but unaltered Abeta 1-42 (mean 72.1 +- 67.5 vs. 60.0 +- 56.7 pg/ml; p = 0.587) compared to a matched sample not treated with antipsychotic drugs. The same group demonstrated elevated total tau (mean 945.0 +- 422.2 vs. 534.3 +- 388.3 pg/ml; p = 0.010) but not p-tau (mean 98.6 +- 71.5 vs. 88.1 +- 70.5 pg/ml; p = 0.694). No similar effect was found with lithium, antidepressants, carbamazepine or benzodiazepines. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study suggests antipsychotic drugs, widely used in patients with severe depression across all age ranges, may be associated with alteration of Abeta 1-40 and total tau, indices strongly linked with progressive organic brain disease. Further confirmatory work is needed.

21309531|t|Nanopore analysis of beta-amyloid peptide aggregation transition induced by small molecules.
21309531|a|beta-Amyloid 42 (Abeta42) is the predominant form of the amyloid peptide, which is found in the plaques of the brains of Alzheimer's (AD) patients and is one of the most abundant components in amyloid aggregates. Information of the Abeta42 aggregation states is essential for developing an understanding of the pathologic process of amyloidoses. Here, we used alpha-hemolysin (alpha-HL) pores to probe the different aggregation transition of Abeta42 in the presence of beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD), a promoter of Abeta42 aggregations, and in the presence of Congo red (CR), an inhibitor of aggregations. Analyzing the characteristic transit duration times and blockade currents showed that beta-CD and CR have opposite effects on the aggregation of Abeta42. Translocation events of the monomeric Abeta42 peptide were significantly lower in amplitude currents than protofilaments, and protofilaments were captured in the alpha-HL nanopore with a longer duration time. CR binds to Abeta42 and its peptide fibrils by reducing the aggregated fibrils formation. In this process it is assumed CR interferes with intermolecular hydrogen bonding present in the aggregates. In contrast to CR, beta-CD promotes the aggregation of Abeta42. These differences can readily be analyzed by monitoring the corresponding characteristic blockade events using a biological alpha-HL nanopore.

21310725|t|Independent contribution of temporal beta-amyloid deposition to memory decline in the pre-dementia phase of Alzheimer's disease.
21310725|a|The relationship between beta-amyloid deposition and memory deficits in early Alzheimer's disease is unresolved, as past studies show conflicting findings. The present study aims to determine the relative contribution of regional beta-amyloid deposition, hippocampal atrophy and white matter integrity to episodic memory deficits in non-demented older individuals harbouring one of the characteristic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, i.e. with beta-amyloid pathology. Understanding these relationships is critical for effective therapeutic development. Brain magnetic resonance imaging and [(11)C]Pittsburgh Compound B-positron emission tomography scans were obtained in 136 non-demented individuals aged over 60 years, including 93 healthy elderly and 43 patients with mild cognitive impairment. Voxel-based correlations were computed between a memory composite score and grey matter volume, white matter volume and beta-amyloid deposition imaging datasets. Hierarchical linear regression analyses were then performed using values extracted in regions of most significant correlations to determine the relative contribution of each modality to memory deficits. All analyses were conducted pooling all groups together as well as within separate subgroups of cognitively normal elderly, patients with mild cognitive impairment and individuals with high versus low neocortical beta-amyloid. Brain areas of highest correlation with episodic memory deficits were the hippocampi for grey matter volume, the perforant path for white matter volume and the temporal neocortex for beta-amyloid deposition. When considering these three variables together, only hippocampal volume and temporal beta-amyloid deposition provided independent contributions to memory deficits. In contrast to global beta-amyloid deposition, temporal beta-amyloid deposition was still related to memory independently from hippocampal atrophy within subgroups of cognitively normal elderly, patients with mild cognitive impairment or cases with high neocortical beta-amyloid. In the pre-dementia stage of Alzheimer's disease, subtle episodic memory impairment is related to beta-amyloid deposition, especially in the temporal neocortex, and independently from hippocampal atrophy, suggesting that both factors should be independently targeted in therapeutic trials aimed at reducing cognitive decline.

21311900|t|Qualification of the analytical and clinical performance of CSF biomarker analyses in ADNI.
21311900|a|The close correlation between abnormally low pre-mortem cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta(1-42)) and plaque burden measured by amyloid imaging as well as between pathologically increased levels of CSF tau and the extent of neurodegeneration measured by MRI has led to growing interest in using these biomarkers to predict the presence of AD plaque and tangle pathology. A challenge for the widespread use of these CSF biomarkers is the high variability in the assays used to measure these analytes which has been ascribed to multiple pre-analytical and analytical test performance factors. To address this challenge, we conducted a seven-center inter-laboratory standardization study for CSF total tau (t-tau), phospho-tau (p-tau(181)) and Abeta(1-42) as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Aliquots prepared from five CSF pools assembled from multiple elderly controls (n = 3) and AD patients (n = 2) were the primary test samples analyzed in each of three analytical runs by the participating laboratories using a common batch of research use only immunoassay reagents (INNO-BIA AlzBio3, xMAP technology, from Innogenetics) on the Luminex analytical platform. To account for the combined effects on overall precision of CSF samples (fixed effect), different laboratories and analytical runs (random effects), these data were analyzed by mixed-effects modeling with the following results: within center %CV 95% CI values (mean) of 4.0-6.0% (5.3%) for CSF Abeta(1-42); 6.4-6.8% (6.7%) for t-tau and 5.5-18.0% (10.8%) for p-tau(181) and inter-center %CV 95% CI range of 15.9-19.8% (17.9%) for Abeta(1-42), 9.6-15.2% (13.1%) for t-tau and 11.3-18.2% (14.6%) for p-tau(181). Long-term experience by the ADNI biomarker core laboratory replicated this degree of within-center precision. Diagnostic threshold CSF concentrations for Abeta(1-42) and for the ratio t-tau/Abeta(1-42) were determined in an ADNI independent, autopsy-confirmed AD cohort from whom ante-mortem CSF was obtained, and a clinically defined group of cognitively normal controls (NCs) provides statistically significant separation of those who progressed from MCI to AD in the ADNI study. These data suggest that interrogation of ante-mortem CSF in cognitively impaired individuals to determine levels of t-tau, p-tau(181) and Abeta(1-42), together with MRI and amyloid imaging biomarkers, could replace autopsy confirmation of AD plaque and tangle pathology as the "gold standard" for the diagnosis of definite AD in the near future.

21316678|t|Attenuated atherogenesis in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice lacking amyloid precursor protein.
21316678|a|OBJECTIVE: Recent evidence suggests that amyloid precursor protein (APP) is overexpressed in atherosclerosis-prone regions of mouse aorta. We therefore investigated in the present study whether APP has a role in the progression and composition of atherosclerotic plaques. METHODS AND RESULTS: Apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE(-/-)) mice were crossbred with animals lacking APP (APP(-/-)). After 16 weeks on a Western-type diet, apoE(-/-) and APP(-/-)/apoE(-/-) mice showed similar cholesterol levels. However, atherosclerotic plaque size was significantly reduced in the distal thoracic aorta (90% reduction) and abdominal aorta (75% reduction) of APP(-/-)/apoE(-/-) mice as compared to apoE(-/-). Plaques at the level of the aortic valves were not different in size, but showed a more stable phenotype in APP(-/-)/apoE(-/-) mice, as indicated by a reduced macrophage content, an increased amount of collagen and a thicker fibrous cap. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide evidence that lack of APP attenuates atherogenesis and leads to plaque stability.

21320126|t|Targets for AD treatment: conflicting messages from gamma-secretase inhibitors.
21320126|a|Current evidence suggests that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multi-factorial disease that starts with accumulation of multiple proteins. We have previously proposed that inhibition of gamma-secretase may impair membrane recycling causing neurodegeneration starting at synapses (Sambamurti K., Suram A., Venugopal C., Prakasam A., Zhou Y., Lahiri D. K. and Greig N. H. A partial failure of membrane protein turnover may cause Alzheimer's disease: a new hypothesis. Curr. Alzheimer Res., 3, 2006, 81). We also proposed familal AD mutations increase Abeta42 by inhibiting gamma-secretase. Herein, we discuss the failure of Eli Lilly's gamma-secretase inhibitor, semagacestat, in clinical trials in the light of our hypothesis, which extends the problem beyond toxicity of Abeta aggregates. We elaborate that gamma-secretase inhibitors lead to accumulation of amyloid precursor protein C-terminal fragments that can later be processed by gamma-secretase to yields bursts of Abeta to facilitate aggregation. Although we do not exclude a role for toxic Abeta aggregates, inhibition of gamma-secretase can affect numerous substrates other than amyloid precursor protein to affect multiple pathways and the combined accumulation of multiple peptides in the membrane may impair its function and turnover. Taken together, protein processing and turnover pathways play an important role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and unless we clearly see consistent disease-related increase in their levels or activity, we need to focus on preserving their function rather than inhibiting them for treatment of AD and similar diseases.

21320453|t|Alzheimer's disease drug candidates stabilize A-beta protein native structure by interacting with the hydrophobic core.
21320453|a|Deposition of amyloid fibrils, consisting primarily of Abeta(40) and Abeta(42) peptides, in the extracellular space in the brain is a major characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We recently developed new (to our knowledge) drug candidates for AD that inhibit the fibril formation of Abeta peptides and eliminate their neurotoxicity. We performed all-atom molecular-dynamics simulations on the Abeta(42) monomer at its alpha-helical conformation and a pentamer fibril fragment of Abeta(42) peptide with or without LRL and fluorene series compounds to investigate the mechanism of inhibition. The results show that the active drug candidates, LRL22 (EC(50) = 0.734 muM) and K162 (EC(50) = 0.080 muM), stabilize hydrophobic core I of Abeta(42) peptide (residues 17-21) to its alpha-helical conformation by interacting specifically in this region. The nonactive drug candidates, LRL27 (EC(50) > 10 muM) and K182 (EC(50) > 5 muM), have little to no similar effect. This explains the different behavior of the drug candidates in experiments. Of more importance, this phenomenon indicates that hydrophobic core I of the Abeta(42) peptide plays a major mechanistic role in the formation of amyloid fibrils, and paves the way for the development of new drugs against AD.

21320603|t|Bacterial expression, purification, and model membrane reconstitution of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the human APP binding protein LR11/SorLA for NMR studies.
21320603|a|LR11 (SorLA) is a recently identified neuronal protein that interacts with amyloid precursor protein (APP), a central player in the pathology of the Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is a neurodegenerative disease and the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. Current estimates suggest that as many as 5.3 million Americans are living with AD. Recent investigations have uncovered the pathophysiological relevance of APP intracellular trafficking in AD. LR11 is of particular importance due to its role in regulating APP transport and processing. LR11 is a type I transmembrane protein and belongs to a novel family of Vps10p receptors. Using a new expression vector, pMTTH (MBP-MCS1 (multiple cloning site)-Thrombin protease cleavage site-MCS2-TEV protease cleavage site-MCS3-His(6)), we successfully expressed, purified and reconstituted the LR11 transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic (CT) domains into bicelles and detergent micelles for NMR structural studies. This new construct allowed us to overcome several obstacles during sample preparation. MBP fused LR11TM and LR11TMCT proteins are preferably expressed at high levels in Escherichia coli membrane, making a refolding of the protein unnecessary. The C-terminal His-tag allows for easy separation of the target protein from the truncated products from the C-terminus, and provides a convenient route for screening detergents to produce high quality 2D (1)H-(15)N TROSY spectra. Thrombin protease cleavage is compatible with most of the commonly used detergents, including a direct cleavage at the E. coli membrane surface. This new MBP construct may provide an effective route for the preparation of small proteins with TM domains.

21321391|t|Matrix metalloproteinase-9 participates in NGF-induced alpha-secretase cleavage of amyloid-beta protein precursor in PC12 cells.
21321391|a|Amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) is a ubiquitously expressed glycoprotein, which under physiological conditions can be cleaved following two alternative routes; the non-amyloidogenic and the amyloidogenic pathway. Shift of AbetaPP processing in favor of the amyloidogenic pathway is a key event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Among the factors that regulate AbetaPP processing, nerve growth factor (NGF) appears to play an important role; abnormal NGF signaling has been implicated in the onset of AD. In the present study, we used PC12 cells to study the effects of NGF on AbetaPP processing and provide evidence that NGF, through binding to its high affinity receptor, TrkA moderately down-regulates the expression of the beta-secretase beta-site AbetaPP cleaving enzyme-1 and, most importantly, upregulates the expression of two enzymes with alpha-secretase activity, a disintegrin and metalloprotease-17 and to a greater extent matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) in a phosphoinositide kinase-3 dependent manner. Finally, we demonstrate that MMP9 actively participates in NGF-induced alpha-secretase cleavage of AbetaPP, thus it contributes to the shift of AbetaPP processing towards the non-amyloidogenic pathway precluding the formation of neurotoxic Abeta peptides.

21321395|t|Analysis of postmortem ventricular cerebrospinal fluid from patients with and without dementia indicates association of vitamin E with neuritic plaques and specific measures of cognitive performance.
21321395|a|Ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (vCSF) obtained at autopsy from 230 participants in the Religious Orders Study was analyzed for alpha tocopherol (alphaT, vitamin E) and gamma tocopherol (gammaT) in relation to brain tissue neuropathological diagnoses (NIA-Reagan criteria); neuritic plaque density and neurofibrillary tangle state (Braak stage); and cognitive function proximate to death. Neither vCSF alphaT nor gammaT was related to the pathological diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, but vCSF alphaT concentration was inversely related to neuritic plaque density (beta = -0.21, SE = 0.105, p = 0.04) in regression models adjusted for age, gender, education, and APOE-4. Ventricular CSF alphaT concentration was positively associated with perceptual speed (beta = 0.27, SE = 0.116, p = 0.02) whereas the gammaT/alphaT ratio was negatively associated with episodic memory (beta = -0.037, SE = 0.017, p = 0.04). Only vCSF alphaT, but not gammaT, was correlated with postmortem interval (PMI). Adjustment for PMI had no effect on significance of associations between alphaT and perceptual speed or gammaT/alphaT and episodic memory, but after this adjustment the alphaT concentration was no longer significantly associated with neuritic plaques. These data suggest that vCSF alphaT, but not gammaT, is weakly associated with less Alzheimer's disease neuropathology, specifically neuritic plaques, and correlates with better performance on tests of perceptual speed.

21321397|t|The gamma-secretase modulator CHF5074 restores memory and hippocampal synaptic plasticity in plaque-free Tg2576 mice.
21321397|a|Abnormal amyloid-beta (Abeta) production and deposition is believed to represent one of the main causes of Alzheimer's disease (AD). gamma-Secretase is the enzymatic complex responsible for Abeta generation from its precursor protein. Inhibition or modulation of gamma-secretase represents an attractive therapeutic approach. CHF5074 is a new gamma-secretase modulator that has been shown to inhibit brain plaque deposition and to attenuate memory deficit in adult AD transgenic mice after chronic treatment. To date, it is not known whether the positive behavioral effects of this compound also occur in young transgenic mice without plaque deposition. Here, we evaluated the effects of acute and subchronic treatment with CHF5074 on contextual and recognition memory and on hippocampal synaptic plasticity in plaque-free Tg2576 mice. We found that at 5 months of age, contextual memory impairment was significantly attenuated after acute subcutaneous administration of 30 mg/kg CHF5074. At 6 months of age, recognition memory impairment was fully reversed after a 4-week oral treatment in the diet ( 60 mg/kg/day). These cognitive effects were associated with a reversal of long-term potentiation (LTP) impairment in the hippocampus. A significant reduction in brain intraneuronal AbetaPP/Abeta levels and hyperphosphorylated tau, but no change in soluble or oligomeric Abeta levels was detected in Tg2576 mice showing functional recovery following CHF5074 treatment. We conclude that the beneficial effects of CHF5074 treatment in young transgenic mice occurred at a stage that precedes plaque formation and were associated with a reduction in intraneuronal AbetaPP/Abeta and hyperphosphorylated tau.

21321398|t|Independent component analysis-based classification of Alzheimer's disease MRI data.
21321398|a|There is an unmet medical need to identify neuroimaging biomarkers that allow us to accurately diagnose and monitor Alzheimer's disease (AD) at its very early stages and to assess the response to AD-modifying therapies. To a certain extent, volumetric and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies can detect changes in structure, cerebral blood flow, and blood oxygenation that distinguish AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects from healthy control (HC) subjects. However, it has been challenging to use fully automated MRI analytic methods to identify potential AD neuroimaging biomarkers. We have thus proposed a method based on independent component analysis (ICA) for studying potential AD-related MR image features that can be coupled with the use of support vector machine (SVM) for classifying scans into categories of AD, MCI, and HC subjects. The MRI data were selected from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative databases. The experimental results showed that the ICA method coupled with SVM classifier can differentiate AD and MCI patients from HC subjects, although further methodological improvement in the analytic method and inclusion of additional variables may be required for optimal classification.

21321937|t|Amyloid-beta-induced reactive oxygen species production and priming are differentially regulated by ion channels in microglia.
21321937|a|Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by microglial cells and subsequent oxidative stress are strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Although it is recognized that amyloid-beta (Abeta) plays a major role in inducing and regulating microglial ROS production in Alzheimer's disease, to date little is known about cellular mechanisms underlying Abeta-stimulated ROS production. Here, we identified ion channels involved in Abeta-induced microglial ROS production and in Abeta-induced microglial priming. Acute stimulation of microglial cells with either fibrillar Abeta(1-42) (fAbeta(1-42) ) or soluble Abeta(1-42) (sAbeta(1-42) ) caused significant increases in microglial ROS production, which were abolished by inhibition of TRPV1 cation channels with 5-iodo-resiniferatoxin (I-RTX), but were unaffected by inhibition of K(+) channels with charybdotoxin (CTX). Furthermore, pretreatment with either fAbeta(1-42) or sAbeta(1-42) induced microglial priming, that is, increased ROS production upon secondary stimulation with the phorbol ester PMA. Microglial priming induced by fAbeta(1-42) or sAbeta(1-42) remained unaffected by TRPV1 channel inhibition with I-RTX. However, sAbeta(1-42) -induced priming was inhibited by CTX and margatoxin, but not by TRAM-34 or paxilline, indicating a role of Kv1.3 voltage-gated K(+) channels, but not of Ca(2+) -activated K(+) channels, in the priming process. In summary, our data suggest that in microglia Abeta-induced ROS production and priming are differentially regulated by ion channels, and that TRPV1 cation channels and Kv1.3 K(+) channels may provide potential therapeutic targets to reduce microglia-induced oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease.

21321998|t|Effect of beta-amyloid (25-35) on mitochondrial function and expression of mitochondrial permeability transition pore proteins in rat hippocampal neurons.
21321998|a|The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the beta-amyloid fragment Abeta(25-35) on mitochondrial structure and function and on the expression of proteins associated with the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) in rat hippocampal neurons. Ninety clean-grade Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to six groups (n = 15 per group). Abeta(25-35) (1, 5, or 10 microg/rat) was injected into hippocampal area CA1. Normal saline was injected as a control. The effect of Abeta(25-35) injection on hippocampal structure was assessed by transmission electron microscopy. Ca(2+) -ATPase activity, [Ca(2+) ](i) , and mitochondrial membrane potential were measured. The expression of genes associated with the MPTP, including the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), and cyclophilin D (Cyp-D), were evaluated. Results showed that Abeta(25-35) injection damaged the mitochondrial structure of hippocampal neurons, decreased Ca(2+) -ATPase activity and mitochondrial membrane potential, and increased [Ca(2+) ](i) . The expression levels for VDAC, ANT, and Cyp-D in all groups were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than those in the normal control group after Abeta(25-35) injection. These results indicate that Abeta(25-35) damages mitochondria in rat hippocampal neurons and effects mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as increasing the expression of genes associated with the MPTP. Mitochondrial dysfunction may result in increased MPTP gene expression, leading to neurodegenerative effects.

21322570|t|Dissociation of apolipoprotein E oligomers to monomer is required for high-affinity binding to phospholipid vesicles.
21322570|a|The apolipoprotein apoE plays a key role in cholesterol and lipid metabolism. There are three isoforms of this protein, one of which, apoE4, is the major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. At micromolar concentrations all lipid-free apoE isoforms exist primarily as monomers, dimers, and tetramers. However, the molecular weight form of apoE that binds to lipid has not been clearly defined. We have examined the role of self-association of apoE with respect to interactions with phospholipids. Measurements of the time dependence of turbidity clearance of small unilamellar vesicles of dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) upon addition of apoE show that higher molecular weight oligomers bind poorly if at all. The kinetic data can be described by a reaction model in which tetramers and dimers of apoE must first dissociate to monomers which then bind to the liposome surface in a fast and reversible manner. A slow but not readily reversible conformational conversion of the monomer then occurs. Prior knowledge of the rate constants for the association-dissociation process allows us to determine the rate constant of the conformational conversion. This rate constant is isoform dependent and appears to correlate with the stability of the apoE isoforms with the rate of dissociation of the apoE oligomers to monomers being the rate-limiting process for lipidation. Differences in the lipidation kinetics between the apoE isoforms arise from their differences in the self-association behavior leading to the conclusion that self-association behavior may influence biological functions of apoE in an isoform-dependent manner.

21322641|t|Biflavonoids are superior to monoflavonoids in inhibiting amyloid-beta toxicity and fibrillogenesis via accumulation of nontoxic oligomer-like structures.
21322641|a|Polymerization of monomeric amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) into soluble oligomers and insoluble fibrils is one of the major pathways triggering the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using small molecules to prevent the polymerization of Abeta peptides can, therefore, be an effective therapeutic strategy for AD. In this study, we investigate the effects of mono- and biflavonoids in Abeta42-induced toxicity and fibrillogenesis and find that the biflavonoid taiwaniaflavone (TF) effectively and specifically inhibits Abeta toxicity and fibrillogenesis. Compared to TF, the monoflavonoid apigenin (AP) is less effective and less specific. Our data show that differential effects of the mono- and biflavonoids in Abeta fibrillogenesis correlate with their varying cytoprotective efficacies. We also find that other biflavonoids, namely, 2',8''-biapigenin, amentoflavone, and sumaflavone, can also effectively inhibit Abeta toxicity and fibrillogenesis, implying that the participation of two monoflavonoids in a single biflavonoid molecule enhances their activity. Biflavonoids, while strongly inhibiting Abeta fibrillogenesis, accumulate nontoxic Abeta oligomeric structures, suggesting that these are off-pathway oligomers. Moreover, TF abrogates the toxicity of preformed Abeta oligomers and fibrils, indicating that TF and other biflavonoids may also reduce the toxicity of toxic Abeta species. Altogether, our data clearly show that biflavonoids, possibly because of the possession of two Abeta binders separated by an appropriate size linker, are likely to be promising therapeutics for suppressing Abeta toxicity.

21323766|t|The increased density of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-immunoreactive microglia in the sensorimotor cortex of aged TgCRND8 mice is associated predominantly with smaller dense-core amyloid plaques.
21323766|a|The role for phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase [p-p38(MAPK)] in beta-amyloid plaque deposition [a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology] remains ambiguous. We combined immunohistochemistry and stereological sampling to quantify the distribution of plaques and p-p38(MAPK)-immunoreactive (IR) cells in the sensorimotor cortex of 3-, 6- and 10-month-old TgCRND8 mice. The aggressive nature of the AD-related human amyloid-beta protein precursor expressed in these mice was confirmed by the appearance of both dense-core (thioflavin-S-positive) and diffuse plaques, even in the youngest mice. p-p38(MAPK)-IR cells of the sensorimotor cortex were predominantly co-immunoreactive for the Macrophage-1 (CD11b/CD18) microglial marker. These p-p38(MAPK)-IR microglia were associated with both dense-core and diffuse plaques, but the expected age-dependent increase in the density of plaque-associated p-p38(MAPK)-IR microglia was restricted to dense-core plaques. Furthermore, the density of dense-core plaque-associated p-p38(MAPK)-IR microglia was inversely correlated with the size of the core within the given plaque, which supports a role for these microglia in restricting core growth. p-p38(MAPK)-IR microglia were also observed throughout wildtype and TgCRND8 mouse cortical parenchyma, but the density of these non-plaque-associated microglia remained constant, regardless of age or genotype. We conclude that the constitutive presence of p-p38(MAPK)-IR microglia in aging mouse brain is indicative of a longitudinal role for this kinase in normal brain physiology. We suggest that this fact, as well as the fact that a pool of p-p38(MAPK)-IR microglia appears to restrict beta-amyloid plaque core development, needs to be duly considered when ascribing functions for p38(MAPK) signalling in the AD brain.

21324907|t|Docosahexaenoic acid reduces amyloid beta production via multiple pleiotropic mechanisms.
21324907|a|Alzheimer disease is characterized by accumulation of the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) generated by beta- and gamma-secretase processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). The intake of the polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has been associated with decreased amyloid deposition and a reduced risk in Alzheimer disease in several epidemiological trials; however, the exact underlying molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here, we systematically investigate the effect of DHA on amyloidogenic and nonamyloidogenic APP processing and the potential cross-links to cholesterol metabolism in vivo and in vitro. DHA reduces amyloidogenic processing by decreasing beta- and gamma-secretase activity, whereas the expression and protein levels of BACE1 and presenilin1 remain unchanged. In addition, DHA increases protein stability of alpha-secretase resulting in increased nonamyloidogenic processing. Besides the known effect of DHA to decrease cholesterol de novo synthesis, we found cholesterol distribution in plasma membrane to be altered. In the presence of DHA, cholesterol shifts from raft to non-raft domains, and this is accompanied by a shift in gamma-secretase activity and presenilin1 protein levels. Taken together, DHA directs amyloidogenic processing of APP toward nonamyloidogenic processing, effectively reducing Abeta release. DHA has a typical pleiotropic effect; DHA-mediated Abeta reduction is not the consequence of a single major mechanism but is the result of combined multiple effects.

21325636|t|A disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 activity sheds the ectodomain of the amyloid precursor-like protein 2 and regulates protein expression in proximal tubule cells.
21325636|a|A disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10) is a zinc protease that mediates ectodomain shedding of numerous receptors including Notch and members of the amyloid precursor protein family (APP, APLP1, and APLP2). Ectodomain shedding frequently activates a process called regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) that links cellular events with gene regulation. To characterize ADAM10 in kidney and in opossum kidney proximal tubule (OKP) cells, we performed indirect immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblotting of renal membrane fractions using specific antibodies. These studies show that ADAM10 and APLP2 are coexpressed in the proximal tubule and in OKP cells. To study the role of ADAM10 activity in the proximal tubule, we stably overexpressed wild-type ADAM10 or an inactive mutant ADAM10 in OKP cells. We found a direct correlation between the amount of active ADAM10 expressed and 1) the amount of APLP2 ectodomain shed into the culture supernatant and 2) the amount of Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 3 (NHE3) and megalin mRNA and protein expressed compared with control proteins. To establish a link between ADAM10-mediated shedding of APLP2 and the effect on NHE3 and megalin mRNA expression we performed RNA interference experiments using APLP2-specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in OKP cells. Cells expressing the APLP2 shRNA showed >80% knock down of APLP2 protein and mRNA as well as 60-70% reduction in NHE3 protein and mRNA. Levels of megalin and Na-K-ATPase protein and mRNA were not changed. These studies show 1) ADAM10 and APLP2 are expressed in proximal tubule cells and, 2) ADAM10 activity has a pronounced effect on expression of specific brush-border proteins. We postulate that ADAM10 and APLP2 may represent elements of a here-to-fore unknown signaling pathway in proximal tubule that link events at the brush border with control of gene expression.

21329333|t|Probing amyloid-beta fibril stability by increasing ionic strengths.
21329333|a|Previous experimental studies have demonstrated changing the ionic strength of the solvent to have a great impact on the mechanism of aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein leading to distinct fibril morphology at high and low ionic strength. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the ionic strength-dependent effects on the structure and dynamics of the model Abeta fibril. The change in ionic strength was brought forth by varying the NaCl concentration in the environment surrounding the Abeta fibril. Comparison of the calculated vibrational spectra of Abeta derived from 40 ns all-atom molecular dynamics simulations at different ionic strength reveals the fibril structure to be stiffer with increasing ionic strength. This finding is further corroborated by the calculation of the stretching force constants. Decomposition of binding and dynamical properties into contributions from different structural segments indicates the elongation of the fibril at low ionic strength is most likely promoted by hydrogen bonding between N-terminal parts of the fibril, whereas aggregation at higher ionic strength is suggested to be driven by the hydrophobic interaction.

21330139|t|'Click peptide' using production of monomer Abeta from the O-acyl isopeptide: application to assay system of aggregation inhibitors and cellular cytotoxicity.
21330139|a|The O-acyl isopeptide of Abeta1-42 (1), possessing an ester bond at the Gly(25)-Ser(26) sequence, is a water-soluble and non-aggregative precursor molecule and is capable of production of monomer Abeta1-42. The SDS-PAGE result showed that the Abeta1-42, produced from 1, adopted monomeric state at first and then self-assembled to oligomer. The oligomeric state was stabilized by nordihydroguaiaretic acid. The Thioflavin-T (ThT) fluorescence intensity derived from Abeta1-42 (generated from 1) was suppressed by various aggregation inhibitors. Finally, 1 could generate Abeta1-42 via the O-to-N acyl migration under cellular medium conditions and the produced Abeta1-42 exhibited cytotoxicity against PC12 cells. These results suggest that the click peptide system, which enables us to predominantly produce monomer Abeta1-42 under physiological conditions, would be adoptable to various biochemical and biophysical experiments including cellular system to investigate the functions of Abeta1-42.

21330304|t|Sink hypothesis and therapeutic strategies for attenuating Abeta levels.
21330304|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) plaque, comprised mainly by Abeta peptides, is an important pathology of Alzheimer's brains. Major efforts have been devoted to targeting this neurotoxic Abeta peptide for discovering disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease. Inasmuch as Abeta is found in both the brain and the periphery, it is hypothesized that there is some form of equilibrium for the Abeta in the brain and the periphery such that Abeta can be transported across the blood-brain barrier. By modulating the periphery Abeta levels, it is predicted that the brain Abeta levels will undergo concomitant changes, forming the basis of the "sink hypothesis" for Abeta lowering strategies. In this review, the significance and implication of this sink hypothesis as well as how the sink hypothesis may contribute to the recent Abeta-based drug discovery in AD are discussed. Ultimately, the validity of the sink hypothesis will be resolved when the appropriate Abeta agents are being tested in the clinic.

21334099|t|Age and amyloid-related alterations in default network habituation to stimulus repetition.
21334099|a|The neural networks supporting encoding of new information are thought to decline with age, although mnemonic techniques such as repetition may enhance performance in older individuals. Accumulation of amyloid-beta, one hallmark pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), may contribute to functional alterations in memory networks measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) prior to onset of cognitive impairment. We investigated the effects of age and amyloid burden on fMRI activity in the default network and hippocampus during repetitive encoding. Older individuals, particularly those with high amyloid burden, demonstrated decreased task-induced deactivation in the posteromedial cortices during initial stimulus presentation and failed to modulate fMRI activity in response to repeated trials, whereas young subjects demonstrated a stepwise decrease in deactivation with repetition. The hippocampus demonstrated similar patterns across the groups, showing task-induced activity that decreased in response to repetition. These findings demonstrate that age and amyloid have dissociable functional effects on specific nodes within a distributed memory network, and suggest that functional brain changes may begin far in advance of symptomatic Alzheimer's disease.

21335619|t|Marked accumulation of 27-hydroxycholesterol in the brains of Alzheimer's patients with the Swedish APP 670/671 mutation.
21335619|a|There is a significant flux of the neurotoxic oxysterol 27-hydroxycholesterol (27OHC) from the circulation across the blood-brain barrier. Because there is a correlation between 27OHC and cholesterol in the circulation and lipoprotein-bound cholesterol does not pass the blood-brain barrier, we have suggested that 27OHC may mediate the effects of hypercholesterolemia on the brain. We previously demonstrated a modest accumulation of 27OHC in brains of patients with sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), consistent with a role of 27OHC as a primary pathogenetic factor. We show here that there is a 4-fold accumulation of 27OHC in different regions of the cortexes of patients carrying the Swedish amyloid precursor protein (APPswe) 670/671 mutation. The brain levels of sitosterol and campesterol were not significantly different in the AD patients compared with the controls, suggesting that the blood-brain barrier was intact in the AD patients. We conclude that accumulation of 27OHC is likely to be secondary to neurodegeneration, possibly a result of reduced activity of CYP7B1, the neuronal enzyme responsible for metabolism of 27OHC. We discuss the possibility of a vicious circle in the brains of the patients with familial AD whereby neurodegenerative changes cause an accumulation of 27OHC that further accelerates neurodegeneration.

21335660|t|Clinical phenotype of G206D mutation in the presenilin 1 gene in pathologically confirmed familial Alzheimer's disease.
21335660|a|Familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) is genetically heterogeneous, autosomal dominant, with nearly 100% penetrance. In FAD, most common causative genetic mutations are presenilin 1 (PSEN1), presenilin 2 and amyloid-beta protein precursor. We demonstrate a family presenting as early-onset AD with a rapid deterioration course and seizure developed after 1.5 years of symptoms. A histopathological examination of the frontal cortex showed amyloid deposition and abundant phosphorylated tau deposition. In both cases, a single nucleotide mutation from guanine to adenine at exon 7 was found in PSEN1 (c.617G>A, codon change from GGT to GAT). Though G206D mutation in PSEN1 gene was found in FAD, no clinical phenotype or pathological finding was documented. This is the first report of PSEN1 mutation (Gly206Asp) with features of seizure and a rapid progressive cognitive decline in a pathologically confirmed case of FAD.

21336694|t|The importance of appropriate partial volume correction for PET quantification in Alzheimer's disease.
21336694|a|PURPOSE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Clinically, it is characterized by progressive cognitive and functional impairment with structural hallmarks of cortical atrophy and ventricular expansion. Amyloid plaque aggregation is also known to occur in AD subjects. In-vivo imaging of amyloid plaques is now possible with positron emission tomography (PET) radioligands. PET imaging suffers from a degrading phenomenon known as the partial volume effect (PVE). The quantitative accuracy of PET images is reduced by PVEs primarily due to the limited spatial resolution of the scanner. The degree of PVE is influenced by structure size, with smaller structures tending to suffer from more severe PVEs such as atrophied grey matter regions. The aims of this paper were to investigate the effect of partial volume correction (PVC) on the quantification of amyloid PET and to highlight the importance of selecting an appropriate PVC technique. METHODS: An improved PVC technique, region-based voxel-wise (RBV) correction, was compared against existing Van-Cittert (VC) and Muller-Gartner (MG) methods using amyloid PET imaging data. Digital phantom data were produced using segmented MRI scans from a control subject and an AD subject. Typical tracer distributions were generated for each of the phantom anatomies. Also examined were 70 clinical PET scans acquired using [(18)F]flutemetamol. Volume of interest (VOI) analysis was performed for corrected and uncorrected images. RESULTS: PVC was shown to improve the quantitative accuracy of regional analysis performed on amyloid PET images. Of the corrections applied, VC deconvolution demonstrated the worst recovery of grey matter values. MG PVC was shown to induce biases in some grey matter regions due to grey matter variability. In addition, white matter variability was shown to influence the accuracy of MG PVC in cortical grey matter and also cerebellar grey matter, a typical reference region for amyloid PET normalization in sporadic AD. RBV was shown to be more accurate than MG in terms of grey matter and white matter uptake. An increase in within-group variability after PVC was observed and is believed to be a genuine, more accurate representation of the data rather than a correction-induced error. The standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) threshold for classifying subjects as either amyloid-positive or amyloid-negative was found to be 1.64 in the uncorrected dataset, rising to 2.25 after PVC. CONCLUSION: Care should be taken when applying PVC to amyloid PET images. Assumptions made in existing PVC strategies can induce biases that could lead to erroneous inferences about uptake in certain regions. The proposed RBV PVC technique accounts for within-compartment variability, with the potential to reduce errors of this kind.

21341665|t|Molecular-level examination of Cu2+ binding structure for amyloid fibrils of 40-residue Alzheimer's beta by solid-state NMR spectroscopy.
21341665|a|Cu(2+) binding to Alzheimer's beta (Abeta) peptides in amyloid fibrils has attracted broad attention, as it was shown that Cu ion concentration elevates in Alzheimer's senile plaque and such association of Abeta with Cu(2+) triggers the production of neurotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as H(2)O(2). However, detailed binding sites and binding structures of Cu(2+) to Abeta are still largely unknown for Abeta fibrils or other aggregates of Abeta. In this work, we examined molecular details of Cu(2+) binding to amyloid fibrils by detecting paramagnetic signal quenching in 1D and 2D high-resolution (13)C solid-state NMR (SSNMR) for full-length 40-residue Abeta(1-40). Selective quenching observed in (13)C SSNMR of Cu(2+)-bound Abeta(1-40) suggested that primary Cu(2+) binding sites in Abeta(1-40) fibrils include N(epsilon) in His-13 and His-14 and carboxyl groups in Val-40 as well as in Glu sidechains (Glu-3, Glu-11, and/or Glu-22). (13)C chemical shift analysis demonstrated no major structural changes upon Cu(2+) binding in the hydrophobic core regions (residues 18-25 and 30-36). Although the ROS production via oxidization of Met-35 in the presence of Cu(2+) has been long suspected, our SSNMR analysis of (13)C(epsilon)H(3)-S- in M35 showed little changes after Cu(2+) binding, excluding the possibility of Met-35 oxidization by Cu(2+) alone. Preliminary molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on Cu(2+)-Abeta complex in amyloid fibrils confirmed binding sites suggested by the SSNMR results and the stabilities of such bindings. The MD simulations also indicate the coexistence of a variety of Cu(2+)-binding modes unique in Abeta fibril, which are realized by both intra- and intermolecular contacts and highly concentrated coordination sites due to the in-register parallel beta-sheet arrangements.

21344239|t|Prospective study on association between plasma amyloid beta-42 and atherosclerotic risk factors.
21344239|a|An association between plasma Amyloid beta peptides (Abeta) with blood lipids was reported in cross-sectional studies. The present study examined the 5-year prospective association of atherosclerotic risk factors with plasma Abeta42 in 440 elderly persons without both Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at baseline. Persons in the highest tertile of total cholesterol (TC) or LDL-C at baseline showed low plasma Abeta42 at 5 years. Regression analysis confirmed TC and LDL-C as negative predictors of Abeta42 (p = 0.001). An increase over 5 years of HDL-C was a negative predictor and the presence of an APOE epsilon4 allele was a positive predictor for decrease of Abeta42 in converters to MCI. In converters to AD, increase of both TC and of HbA1c were positive predictors of Abeta42 levels at 5 years. Analysis of covariance showed a positive association between Delta-TC, Delta-LDL-C, Delta-HbA1c, and levels of Abeta42 at 5 years (p = 0.006; 0.013 and 0.027 resp.) in converters to AD independently on lipid-lowering treatment. The association of vascular risk factors TC, LDL-C, and HbA1c with higher Abeta42 levels might, after confirmation in other cohorts, influence the development of lifestyle interventions concerning plasma Abeta42 and AD.

21345167|t|The early involvement of the innate immunity in the pathogenesis of late-onset Alzheimer's disease: neuropathological, epidemiological and genetic evidence.
21345167|a|The idea that an inflammatory process is involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) was proposed already hundred years ago but only the past twenty years inflammation-related proteins have been identified within plaques. A number of acute-phase proteins colocalize with the extracellular amyloid fibrils, the so called Abeta-associated proteins. Activated microglia and astrocytes surrounding amyloid deposits express receptors of innate immunity and secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines. In this paper we review the evidence for involvement of innate immunity in the early stages of the pathological cascade of AD. Diffuse plaques, the initial neuropathological lesion in the cerebral neocortex, contain next to Abeta also apolipoprotein E, clusterin, alpha1-antichymotrypsin and activated complement proteins. Interestingly, genetic studies have shown gene-loci to be associated with AD for all these proteins, except alpha1-antichymotrpsin. Fibrillar Abeta can, through stimulation of toll-like receptors and CD-14 on glial cells, activate pathways for increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This pathway, inducing production of proinflammatory cytokines, is under genetic control. The finding that the responsiveness of the innate immunity is higher in offspring with a parental history of late-onset AD indicates heritable traits for AD that are related to inflammatory processes. Prospective epidemiological studies which report that higher serum levels of certain acute-phase proteins are associated with cognitive decline or dementia provide additional evidence for the early involvement of inflammation in AD pathogenesis. The reviewed neuropathological, epidemiological and genetic findings show evidence for involvement of the innate-immunity in the early stages of pathological cascade as well as for the hypothesis that the innate immunity contributes to the etiology of late-onset AD.

21345847|t|CSF Alzheimer's disease-like pattern in corticobasal syndrome: evidence for a distinct disorder.
21345847|a|BACKGROUND: Corticobasal syndrome (CBS) has a heterogeneous neuropathological spectrum, ranging from the classical corticobasal degeneration to Alzheimer's disease (AD). The neuropathology of CBS is still unpredictable. CSF tau/abeta ratio is a reliable marker of AD. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the presence of a distinct clinical and neuroimaging CBS phenotype according to CSF pattern. METHODS: 30 patients fulfilling current clinical criteria for CBS entered the study. Each patient underwent a clinical and standardised neuropsychological assessment, and CSF analysis (total tau and abeta42 dosages). CSF AD-like pattern and CSF non-AD like pattern (nAD-like) were identified. In 23 CBS cases, (99m)Tc-ECD single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan was performed and analysed by statistical parametric mapping. RESULTS: CSF AD-like pattern was reported in six cases (20%). The two subgroups did not differ in demographic characteristics or global cognitive impairment. The AD-like group showed greater impairment of memory performances, language and psychomotor speed while the nAD-like group had more severe extrapyramidal syndrome with comparable apraxia scores. Voxel by voxel analysis on SPECT images demonstrated that CBS AD-like patients had greater hypoperfusion in the brain areas typically affected by AD-namely, precuneus, posterior cingulate and hippocampus, bilaterally-compared with nAD-like patients (p<0.001). No clusters above the pre-established threshold were detected when nAD-like were compared with AD-like patients. CONCLUSIONS: CSF AD-like profile in CBS is associated with earlier memory impairment and brain abnormalities typically found in classical AD. These findings argue for the usefulness of CSF testing to identify AD in CBS, and might suggest a different pharmacological approach on the basis of biological data.

21347488|t|Self-folding and aggregation of amyloid nanofibrils.
21347488|a|Amyloids are highly organized protein filaments, rich in beta-sheet secondary structures that self-assemble to form dense plaques in brain tissues affected by severe neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. Alzheimer's Disease). Identified as natural functional materials in bacteria, in addition to their remarkable mechanical properties, amyloids have also been proposed as a platform for novel biomaterials in nanotechnology applications including nanowires, liquid crystals, scaffolds and thin films. Despite recent progress in understanding amyloid structure and behavior, the latent self-assembly mechanism and the underlying adhesion forces that drive the aggregation process remain poorly understood. On the basis of previous full atomistic simulations, here we report a simple coarse-grain model to analyze the competition between adhesive forces and elastic deformation of amyloid fibrils. We use simple model system to investigate self-assembly mechanisms of fibrils, focused on the formation of self-folded nanorackets and nanorings, and thereby address a critical issue in linking the biochemical (Angstrom) to micrometre scales relevant for larger-scale states of functional amyloid materials. We investigate the effect of varying the interfibril adhesion energy on the structure and stability of self-folded nanorackets and nanorings and demonstrate that these aggregated amyloid fibrils are stable in such states even when the fibril-fibril interaction is relatively weak, given that the constituting amyloid fibril length exceeds a critical fibril length-scale of several hundred nanometres. We further present a simple approach to directly determine the interfibril adhesion strength from geometric measures. In addition to providing insight into the physics of aggregation of amyloid fibrils our model enables the analysis of large-scale amyloid plaques and presents a new method for the estimation and engineering of the adhesive forces responsible of the self-assembly process of amyloid nanostructures, filling a gap that previously existed between full atomistic simulations of primarily ultra-short fibrils and much larger micrometre-scale amyloid aggregates. Via direct simulation of large-scale amyloid aggregates consisting of hundreds of fibrils we demonstrate that the fibril length has a profound impact on their structure and mechanical properties, where the critical fibril length-scale derived from our analysis of self-folded nanorackets and nanorings defines the structure of amyloid aggregates. A multi-scale modeling approach as used here, bridging the scales from Angstroms to micrometres, opens a wide range of possible nanotechnology applications by presenting a holistic framework that balances mechanical properties of individual fibrils, hierarchical self-assembly, and the adhesive forces determining their stability to facilitate the design of de novo amyloid materials.

21348501|t|Heparin binds 8 kDa gelsolin cross-beta-sheet oligomers and accelerates amyloidogenesis by hastening fibril extension.
21348501|a|Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are highly sulfated linear polysaccharides prevalent in the extracellular matrix, and they associate with virtually all amyloid deposits in vivo. GAGs accelerate the aggregation of many amyloidogenic peptides in vitro, but little mechanistic evidence is available to explain why. Herein, spectroscopic methods demonstrate that GAGs do not affect the secondary structure of the monomeric 8 kDa amyloidogenic fragment of human plasma gelsolin. Moreover, monomerized 8 kDa gelsolin does not bind to heparin under physiological conditions. In contrast, 8 kDa gelsolin cross-beta-sheet oligomers and amyloid fibrils bind strongly to heparin, apparently because of electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged polysaccharide and a positively charged region of the 8 kDa gelsolin assemblies. Our observations are consistent with a scaffolding mechanism whereby cross-beta-sheet oligomers, upon formation, bind to GAGs, accelerating the fibril extension phase of amyloidogenesis, possibly by concentrating and orienting the oligomers to more efficiently form amyloid fibrils. Notably, heparin decreases the 8 kDa gelsolin concentration necessary for amyloid fibril formation, likely a consequence of fibril stabilization through heparin binding. Because GAG overexpression, which is common in amyloidosis, may represent a strategy for minimizing cross-beta-sheet oligomer toxicity by transforming them into amyloid fibrils, the mechanism described herein for GAG-mediated acceleration of 8 kDa gelsolin amyloidogenesis provides a starting point for therapeutic strategy development. The addition of GAG mimetics, small molecule sulfonates shown to reduce the amyloid load in animal models of amyloidosis, to a heparin-accelerated 8 kDa gelsolin aggregation reaction mixture neither significantly alters the rate of amyloidogenesis nor prevents oligomers from binding to GAGs, calling into question their commonly accepted mechanism.

21349580|t|Amyloid beta peptide oligomers directly activate NMDA receptors.
21349580|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) oligomers accumulate in the brain tissue of Alzheimer disease patients and are related to disease pathogenesis. The precise mechanisms by which Abeta oligomers cause neurotoxicity remain unknown. We recently reported that Abeta oligomers cause intracellular Ca(2+) overload and neuronal death that can be prevented by NMDA receptor antagonists. This study investigated whether Abeta oligomers directly activated NMDA receptors (NMDARs) using NR1/NR2A and NR1/NR2B receptors that were heterologously expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Indeed, Abeta oligomers induced inward non-desensitizing currents that were blocked in the presence of the NMDA receptor antagonists memantine, APV, and MK-801. Intriguingly, the amplitude of the responses to Abeta oligomers was greater for NR1/NR2A heteromers than for NR1/NR2B heteromers expressed in oocytes. Consistent with these findings, we observed that the increase in the cytosolic concentration of Ca(2+) induced by Abeta oligomers in cortical neurons is prevented by AP5, a broad spectrum NMDA receptor antagonist, but slightly attenuated by ifenprodil which blocks receptors with the NR2B subunit. Together, these results indicate that Abeta oligomers directly activate NMDA receptors, particularly those with the NR2A subunit, and further suggest that drugs that attenuate the activity of such receptors may prevent Abeta damage to neurons in Alzheimers disease.

21349839|t|Nature of the amyloid-beta monomer and the monomer-oligomer equilibrium.
21349839|a|The monomer to oligomer transition initiates the aggregation and pathogenic transformation of Alzheimer amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide. However, the monomeric state of this aggregation-prone peptide has remained beyond the reach of most experimental techniques, and a quantitative understanding of this transition is yet to emerge. Here, we employ single-molecule level fluorescence tools to characterize the monomeric state and the monomer-oligomer transition at physiological concentrations in buffers mimicking the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Our measurements show that the monomer has a hydrodynamic radius of 0.9 +- 0.1 nm, which confirms the prediction made by some of the in silico studies. Surprisingly, at equilibrium, both Abeta(40) and Abeta(42) remain predominantly monomeric up to 3 mum, above which it forms large aggregates. This concentration is much higher than the estimated concentrations in the CSF of either normal or diseased brains. If Abeta oligomers are present in the CSF and are the key agents in Alzheimer pathology, as is generally believed, then these must be released in the CSF as preformed entities. Although the oligomers are thermodynamically unstable, we find that a large kinetic barrier, which is mostly entropic in origin, strongly impedes their dissociation. Thermodynamic principles therefore allow the development of a pharmacological agent that can catalytically convert metastable oligomers into nontoxic monomers.

21352228|t|Amyloid-beta oligomers increase the localization of prion protein at the cell surface.
21352228|a|In Alzheimer's disease, the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) interacts with distinct proteins at the cell surface to interfere with synaptic communication. Recent data have implicated the prion protein (PrP(C)) as a putative receptor for Abeta. We show here that Abeta oligomers signal in cells in a PrP(C)-dependent manner, as might be expected if Abeta oligomers use PrP(C) as a receptor. Immunofluorescence, flow cytometry and cell surface protein biotinylation experiments indicated that treatment with Abeta oligomers, but not monomers, increased the localization of PrP(C) at the cell surface in cell lines. These results were reproduced in hippocampal neuronal cultures by labeling cell surface PrP(C). In order to understand possible mechanisms involved with this effect of Abeta oligomers, we used live cell confocal and total internal reflection microscopy in cell lines. Abeta oligomers inhibited the constitutive endocytosis of PrP(C), but we also found that after Abeta oligomer-treatment PrP(C) formed more clusters at the cell surface, suggesting the possibility of multiple effects of Abeta oligomers. Our experiments show for the first time that Abeta oligomers signal in a PrP(C)-dependent way and that they can affect PrP(C) trafficking, increasing its localization at the cell surface.

21352912|t|Curcumin activates Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway through inhibiting the activity of GSK-3beta in APPswe transfected SY5Y cells.
21352912|a|Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway plays an important role in the genesis and development of Alzheimer's disease. The study aims to investigate the effect of Curcumin on the expression of GSK-3beta, beta-catenin and CyclinD1 in vitro, which are tightly correlated with Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, and also to explore the mechanisms, which will provide a novel therapeutic intervention for treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Plasmid APPswe and BACE1-mychis were transiently co-transfected into SHSY5Y cells by Liposfectamin 2000. The cells were treated with Curcumin at 0, 1.25, 5.0, 20.0 mumol/L for 24 h, or with Curcumin at 5.0 mumol/L for 0, and 12, 24 and 48 h for time course assay. Cell lysates were collected for RT-PCR, Western blot assay and immunofluorescent staining were carried out for detecting the effect of Curcumin on the expression of GSK-3beta, beta-catenin and CyclinD1. RT-PCR and Western blot results showed that the expression of GSK-3beta mRNA and protein significantly decreased in the transfected cells treated with Curcumin, and that the changes were in a dose and time-dependent manner (P<0.05); however, the protein expression of GSK-3beta-Ser9 was increased (P<0.05). Meanwhile, the expressions of beta-catenin and transcriptional factors CyclinD1 mRNA and protein increased and the changes were also in a dose and time-dependent manner (P<0.05). Immunofluorescent staining results not only confirmed the above changes, but also showed that beta-catenin had translocated into the nucleus gradually with the increased dosage of Curcumin. Therefore, GSK-3beta is a potential target for treatment of AD. Curcumin could activate the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway through inhibiting the expression of GSK-3beta and inducing the expression of beta-catenin and CyclinD1, which will provide a new theory for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases by Curcumin.

21354405|t|On the origin of the stronger binding of PIB over thioflavin T to protofibrils of the Alzheimer amyloid-beta peptide: a molecular dynamics study.
21354405|a|Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) is a neutral derivative of the fluorescent dye Thioflavin T (ThT), which displays enhanced hydrophobicity and binding affinity to amyloid fibrils. We present molecular dynamics simulations of binding of PIB and ThT to a common cross-beta-subunit of the Alzheimer Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta). Our simulations of binding to Abeta(9-40) protofibrils show that PIB, like ThT, selectively binds to the hydrophobic or aromatic surface grooves on the beta-sheet surface along the fibril axis. The lack of two methyl groups and charge in PIB not only improves its hydrophobicity but also leads to a deeper insertion of PIB compared to ThT into the surface grooves. This significantly increases the steric, aromatic, and hydrophobic interactions, and hence leads to stronger binding. Simulations on protofibrils consisting of the more-toxic Abeta(17-42) revealed an additional binding mode in which PIB and ThT insert into the channel that forms in the loop region of the protofibril, sandwiched between two sheet layers. Our simulations indicate that the rotation between the two ring parts of the dyes is significantly more restricted when the dyes are bound to the surface of the cross-beta-subunits or to the channel inside the Abeta(17-42) cross-beta-subunit, compared with free solution. The specific conformations of the dyes are influenced by small chemical modifications (ThT versus PIB) and by the environment in which the dye is placed.

21354436|t|Estradiol and tamoxifen differentially regulate a plasmalemmal voltage-dependent anion channel involved in amyloid-beta induced neurotoxicity.
21354436|a|There is a wealth of information indicating that estradiol exerts rapid actions involved in neuroprotection and cognitive-enhancing effects. Some of these effects appear to delay onset, or even ameliorate, the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), although some controversy exists about the beneficial brain effects of estrogen therapies. Therefore, it is crucial to better understand the mechanisms developed by 17beta-estradiol to signal in the brain. At the neuronal membrane, the hormone can rapidly interact with estrogen receptors (mERs) or activate other receptors, such as G protein-coupled and ionotropic receptors. And the list of membrane signalling molecules modulated by estradiol in neurons is increasing. VDAC is a voltage-dependent anion channel, known as a mitochondrial porin which is also found at the neuronal membrane, where it appears to be involved in redox regulation, extrinsic apoptosis and amyloid beta neurotoxicity. Moreover, VDAC is present in neuronal lipid rafts, where it is associated with estrogen receptor alpha-like (mER), forming part of a macromolecular complex together with caveolin-1 and other signalling proteins related to neuronal preservation. Interestingly, we have recently found that 17beta-estradiol rapidly promotes VDAC phosphorylation through the activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and Src-kinase, which may be relevant to maintain this channel inactivated. On the contrary, tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), provokes the dephosphorylation of VDAC, and eventually its opening, by activating a cascade of phosphatases, including protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A). This review will focus on the relevance of these novel findings in the alternative estrogen mechanisms to achieve neuroprotection related to AD.

21354796|t|Disassembly of preformed amyloid beta fibrils by small organofluorine molecules.
21354796|a|A potential therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease is to reduce the amount of toxic amyloid-beta oligomers and fibrillar amyloid plaques. In order to contribute to this approach the ability of small organofluorine compounds that were previously reported as successful inhibitors of fibrillogenesis to destabilize preformed fibrils of the amyloid-beta peptide was studied. These organofluorine molecules including chiral compounds were tested in vitro using standard methods based on Thioflavin-T (THT) fluorescence spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). It was observed that 5'-halogen substituted 3,3,3-trifluoromethyl-2-hydroxyl-(indol-3-yl)-propionic acid esters showed significant activity in the disassembly of the preformed fibrils. Since the same compounds were identified as strong fibrillogenesis inhibitors as well, this dual action makes them promising candidates for further drug development.

21355554|t|Structural evolution of Iowa mutant beta-amyloid fibrils from polymorphic to homogeneous states under repeated seeded growth.
21355554|a|Structural variations in beta-amyloid fibrils are potentially important to the toxicity of these fibrils in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We describe a repeated seeding protocol that selects a homogeneous fibril structure from a polymorphic initial state in the case of 40-residue beta-amyloid fibrils with the Asp23-to-Asn, or Iowa, mutation (D23N-Abeta(1-40)). We use thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to track the evolution of fibril structure through multiple generations under this protocol. The data show that (i) repeated seeding selectively amplifies a single D23N-Abeta(1-40) fibril structure that can be a minor component of the initial polymorphic state; (ii) the final structure is highly sensitive to growth conditions, including pH, temperature, and agitation; (iii) although the initial state can include fibrils that contain both antiparallel and parallel beta-sheets, the final structures contain only parallel beta-sheets, suggesting that antiparallel beta-sheet structures are thermodynamically and kinetically metastable. Additionally, our data demonstrate that ThT fluorescence enhancements, which are commonly used to monitor amyloid fibril formation, vary strongly with structural variations, even among fibrils comprised of the same polypeptide. Finally, we present a simple mathematical model that describes the structural evolution of fibril samples under repeated seeding.

21356140|t|Elevation of BACE in an Abeta rat model of Alzheimer's disease: exacerbation by chronic stress and prevention by nicotine.
21356140|a|In Alzheimer's disease (AD), progressive accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides impairs nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) function by a mechanism that may involve alpha7 and alpha4beta2-nAChR subtypes. Additionally, the beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP)-cleaving enzyme (BACE), the rate-limiting enzyme in the pathogenic Abeta production pathway, is expressed at high levels in hippocampal and cortical regions of AD brains. We measured hippocampal area CA1 protein levels of BACE and alpha7- and alpha4beta2-nAChR subunits using an Abeta rat model of AD (14-d osmotic pump i.c.v. infusion of 300 pmol/d Abeta peptides) in the presence and absence of chronic stress and/or chronic nicotine treatment. There was a significant increase in the levels of BACE in Abeta-infused rats, which were markedly intensified by chronic (4-6 wk) stress, but were normalized in Abeta rats chronically treated with nicotine (1 mg/kg b.i.d.). The levels of the three subunits alpha7, alpha4 and beta2 were significantly decreased in Abeta rats, but these were also normalized in Abeta rats chronically treated with nicotine. Chronic stress did not further aggravate the reduction of nAChRs in Abeta-infused rats. The increased BACE levels and decreased nAChR levels, which are established hallmarks of AD, provide additional support for the validity of the Abeta i.c.v.-infused rat as a model of AD.

21357415|t|Attenuated Abeta42 responses to low potency gamma-secretase modulators can be overcome for many pathogenic presenilin mutants by second-generation compounds.
21357415|a|Sequential processing of the beta-amyloid precursor protein by beta- and gamma-secretase generates the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta), which is widely believed to play a causative role in Alzheimer disease. Selective lowering of the pathogenic 42-amino acid variant of Abeta by gamma-secretase modulators (GSMs) is a promising therapeutic strategy. Here we report that mutations in presenilin (PS), the catalytic subunit of gamma-secretase, display differential responses to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-type GSMs and more potent second-generation compounds. Although many pathogenic PS mutations resisted lowering of Abeta(42) generation by the NSAID sulindac sulfide, the potent NSAID-like second-generation compound GSM-1 was capable of lowering Abeta(42) for many but not all mutants. We further found that mutations at homologous positions in PS1 and PS2 can elicit differential Abeta(42) responses to GSM-1, suggesting that a positive GSM-1 response depends on the spatial environment in gamma-secretase. The aggressive pathogenic PS1 L166P mutation was one of the few pathogenic mutations that resisted GSM-1, and Leu-166 was identified as a critical residue with respect to the Abeta(42)-lowering response of GSM-1. Finally, we found that GSM-1-responsive and -resistant PS mutants behave very similarly toward other potent second-generation compounds of different structural classes than GSM-1. Taken together, our data show that a positive Abeta(42) response for PS mutants depends both on the particular mutation and the GSM used and that attenuated Abeta(42) responses to low potency GSMs can be overcome for many PS mutants by second generation GSMs.

21357679|t|Growth arrest-specific 1 binds to and controls the maturation and processing of the amyloid-beta precursor protein.
21357679|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by cerebral deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta), a series of peptides derived from the processing of the amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP). To identify new candidate genes for AD, we recently performed a transcriptome analysis to screen for genes preferentially expressed in the hippocampus and located in AD linkage regions. This strategy identified CALHM1 (calcium homeostasis modulator 1), a gene modulating AD age at onset and Abeta metabolism. Here, we focused our attention on another candidate identified using this screen, growth arrest-specific 1 (Gas1), a gene involved in the central nervous system development. We found that Gas1 formed a complex with APP and controlled APP maturation and processing. Gas1 expression inhibited APP full glycosylation and routing to the cell surface by leading to a trafficking blockade of APP between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi. Gas1 expression also resulted in a robust inhibition of APP transport into multivesicular bodies, further demonstrating that Gas1 negatively regulated APP intracellular trafficking. Consequently, Gas1 overexpression led to a reduction in Abeta production, and conversely, Gas1 silencing in cells expressing endogenously Gas1 increased Abeta levels. These results suggest that Gas1 is a novel APP-interacting protein involved in the control of APP maturation and processing.

21367493|t|Syntheses and characterization of novel oxoisoaporphine derivatives as dual inhibitors for cholinesterases and amyloid beta aggregation.
21367493|a|A series of 3-substituted (5c-5f, 6c-6f) and 4-substituted (10a-10g) oxoisoaporphine derivatives were synthesized. It was found that all these synthetic compounds had IC50 values at micro or nano molar range for cholinesterase inhibition, and most of them could inhibit amyloid beta (Abeta) self-induced aggregation with inhibition ratio from 31.8% to 57.6%. The structure-activity relationship studies revealed that the derivatives with higher selectivity on AChE also showed better inhibition on Abeta self-induced aggregation. The results from cell toxicity study indicated that most quaternary methiodide salts had higher IC50 values than the corresponding non-quaternary compounds. This study provided potentially important information for further development of oxoisoaporphine derivatives as lead compounds for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

21367856|t|Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase regulates the alternative splicing of tau exon 10: a mechanism involved in tau pathology of Alzheimer disease.
21367856|a|Hyperphosphorylation and deposition of tau into neurofibrillary tangles is a hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD). Alternative splicing of tau exon 10 generates tau isoforms containing three or four microtubule binding repeats (3R-tau and 4R-tau), which are equally expressed in adult human brain. Dysregulation of exon 10 causes neurofibrillary degeneration. Here, we report that cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, PKA, phosphorylates splicing factor SRSF1, modulates its binding to tau pre-mRNA, and promotes tau exon 10 inclusion in cultured cells and in vivo in rat brain. PKA-Calpha, but not PKA-Cbeta, interacts with SRSF1 and elevates SRSF1-mediated tau exon 10 inclusion. In AD brain, the decreased level of PKA-Calpha correlates with the increased level of 3R-tau. These findings suggest that a down-regulation of PKA dysregulates the alternative splicing of tau exon 10 and contributes to neurofibrillary degeneration in AD by causing an imbalance in 3R-tau and 4R-tau expression.

21368062|t|Impaired attention in the 3xTgAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease: rescue by donepezil (Aricept).
21368062|a|Several mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with abundant beta-amyloid and/or aberrantly phosphorylated tau develop memory impairments. However, multiple non-mnemonic cognitive domains such as attention and executive control are also compromised early in AD individuals. Currently, it is unclear whether mutations in the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and tau are sufficient to cause similar, AD-like attention deficits in mouse models of the disease. To address this question, we tested 3xTgAD mice (which express APPswe, PS1M146V, and tauP301L mutations) and wild-type control mice on a newly developed touchscreen-based 5-choice serial reaction time test of attention and response control. The 3xTgAD mice attended less accurately to short, spatially unpredictable stimuli when the attentional demand of the task was high, and also showed a general tendency to make more perseverative responses than wild-type mice. The attentional impairment of 3xTgAD mice was comparable to that of AD patients in two aspects: first, although 3xTgAD mice initially responded as accurately as wild-type mice, they subsequently failed to sustain their attention over the duration of the task; second, the ability to sustain attention was enhanced by the cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil (Aricept). These findings demonstrate that familial AD mutations not only affect memory, but also cause significant impairments in attention, a cognitive domain supported by the prefrontal cortex and its afferents. Because attention deficits are likely to affect memory encoding and other cognitive abilities, our findings have important consequences for the assessment of disease mechanisms and therapeutics in animal models of AD.

21368296|t|Dysregulation of Ca2+ signaling in astrocytes from mice lacking amyloid precursor protein.
21368296|a|The relationship between altered metabolism of the amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) and Alzheimer's disease is well established but the physiological roles of APP still remain unclear. Here, we studied Ca(2+) signaling in primary cultured and freshly dissociated cortical astrocytes from APP knockout (KO) mice and from Tg5469 mice overproducing by five- to sixfold wild-type APP. Resting cytosolic Ca(2+) (measured with fura-2) was not altered in cultured astrocytes from APP KO mice. The stored Ca(2+) evaluated by measuring peak amplitude of cyclopiazonic acid [CPA, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) ATPase inhibitor]-induced Ca(2+) transients in Ca(2+)-free medium was significantly smaller in APP KO astrocytes than in wild-type cells. Store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) activated by ER Ca(2+) store depletion with CPA was also greatly reduced in APP KO astrocytes. This reflected a downregulated expression in APP KO astrocytes of TRPC1 (C-type transient receptor potential) and Orai1 proteins, essential components of store-operated channels (SOCs). Indeed, silencer RNA (siRNA) knockdown of Orai1 protein expression in wild-type astrocytes significantly attenuated SOCE. SOCE was also essentially reduced in freshly dissociated APP KO astrocytes. Importantly, knockdown of APP with siRNA in cultured wild-type astrocytes markedly attenuated ATP- and CPA-induced ER Ca(2+) release and extracellular Ca(2+) influx. The latter correlated with downregulation of TRPC1. Overproduction of APP in Tg5469 mice did not alter, however, the stored Ca(2+) level, SOCE, and expression of TRPC1/4/5 in cultured astrocytes from these mice. The data demonstrate that the functional role of APP in astrocytes involves the regulation of TRPC1/Orai1-encoded SOCs critical for Ca(2+) signaling.

21368720|t|Luteolin isolated from the medicinal plant Elsholtzia rugulosa (Labiatae) prevents copper-mediated toxicity in beta-amyloid precursor protein Swedish mutation overexpressing SH-SY5Y cells.
21368720|a|Luteolin, a 3',4',5,7-tetrahydroxyflavone, is a plant flavonoid and pharmacologically active agent that has been isolated from several plant species. In the present study, the effects of luteolin obtained from the medicinal plant Elsholtzia rugulosa and the related mechanisms were examined in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) cell model. In this model, copper was used to exacerbate the neurotoxicity in beta-amyloid precursor protein Swedish mutation stably overexpressed SH-SY5Y cells (named "APPsw cells" for short). Based on this model, we demonstrated that luteolin increased cell viability, reduced intracellular ROS generation, enhanced the activity of SOD and reversed mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation. Inhibition of caspase-related apoptosis was consistently involved in the neuroprotection afforded by luteolin. Furthermore, it down-regulated the expression of AbetaPP and lowered the secretion of Abeta1-42. These results indicated that luteolin from the Elsholtzia rugulosa exerted neroprotective effects through mechanisms that decrease AbetaPP expression, lower Abeta secretion, regulate the redox imbalance, preserve mitochondrial function, and depress the caspase family-related apoptosis.

21371785|t|Immunotherapy of cerebrovascular amyloidosis in a transgenic mouse model.
21371785|a|Cerebrovascular amyloidosis is caused by amyloid accumulation in walls of blood vessel walls leading to hemorrhagic stroke and cognitive impairment. Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) expression levels correlate with the degree of cerebrovascular amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and TGF-beta1 immunoreactivity in such cases is increased along the cerebral blood vessels. Here we show that a nasally administered proteosome-based adjuvant activates macrophages and decreases vascular amyloid in TGF-beta1 mice. Animals were nasally treated with a proteosome-based adjuvant on a weekly basis for 3 months beginning at age 13 months. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) we found that while control animals showed a significant cerebrovascular pathology, proteosome-based adjuvant prevents further brain damage and prevents pathological changes in the blood-brain barrier. Using an object recognition test and Y-maze, we found significant improvement in cognition in the treated group. Our findings support the potential use of a macrophage immunomodulator as a novel approach to reduce cerebrovascular amyloid, prevent microhemorrhage, and improve cognition.

21372138|t|Seeding of normal Tau by pathological Tau conformers drives pathogenesis of Alzheimer-like tangles.
21372138|a|Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in Alzheimer disease and related tauopathies are composed of insoluble hyperphosphorylated Tau protein, but the mechanisms underlying the conversion of highly soluble Tau into insoluble NFTs remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that introduction of minute quantities of misfolded preformed Tau fibrils (Tau pffs) into Tau-expressing cells rapidly recruit large amounts of soluble Tau into filamentous inclusions resembling NFTs with unprecedented efficiency, suggesting a "seeding"-recruitment process as a highly plausible mechanism underlying NFT formation in vivo. Consistent with the emerging concept of prion-like transmissibility of disease-causing amyloidogenic proteins, we found that spontaneous uptake of Tau pffs into cells is likely mediated by endocytosis, suggesting a potential mechanism for the propagation of Tau lesions in tauopathy brains. Furthermore, sequestration of soluble Tau by pff-induced Tau aggregates attenuates microtubule overstabilization in Tau-expressing cells, supporting the hypothesis of a Tau loss-of-function toxicity in cells harboring NFTs. In summary, our study establishes a cellular system that robustly develops authentic NFT-like Tau aggregates, which provides mechanistic insights into NFT pathogenesis and a potential tool for identifying Tau-based therapeutics.

21372823|t|Knock-down of protein L-isoaspartyl O-methyltransferase increases beta-amyloid production by decreasing ADAM10 and ADAM17 levels.
21372823|a|AIM: To examine the role of protein L-isoaspartyl O-methyltransferase (PIMT; EC 2.1.1.77) on the secretion of Abeta peptides. METHODS: HEK293 APPsw cells were treated with PIMT siRNA or adenosine dialdehyde (AdOX), a broad-spectrum methyltransferase inhibitor. Under the conditions, the level of Abeta secretion and regulatory mechanism by PIMT were examined. RESULTS: Knock-down of PIMT and treatment with AdOX significantly increased Abeta(40) secretion. Reductions in levels of PIMT decreased the secretion of soluble amyloid precursor protein alpha (sAPPalpha) without altering the total expression of APP or its membrane-bound C83 fragment. However, the levels of the C99 fragment generated by beta-secretase were enhanced. Moreover, the decreased secretion of sAPPalpha resulting from PIMT knock-down seemed to be linked with the suppression of the expression of alpha-secretase gene products, alpha-disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10) and ADAM17, as indicated by Western blot analysis. In contrast, ADAM10 was not down-regulated in response to treatment with the protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) inhibitor, AMI-1. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a novel role for PIMT, but not PRMT, as a negative regulator of Abeta peptide formation and a potential protective factor in the pathogenesis of AD.

21374699|a|Three loci that modify beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation and deposition in the brains of a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease have been previously described. One encompasses the Psen2 gene encoding presenilin 2, a component of the gamma-secretase activity responsible for generating Abeta by proteolysis. We show that the activity of mouse Psen2, as measured by levels of mRNA accumulation, unexpectedly is heritable in the liver but not the brain, suggesting liver as the origin of brain Abeta deposits. Administration of STI571, a cancer therapeutic that does not cross the blood-brain barrier, reduced accumulation of Abeta in both the blood and the brain, confirming brain Abeta's peripheral origin and suggesting that STI571 and related compounds might have therapeutic/prophylactic value in human Alzheimer's disease. The genes Cib1 and Zfhx1b reside within the other modifier loci and also exhibit heritable expression in the liver, suggesting that they too contribute to Abeta accumulation.

21376022|t|beta-amyloid triggers ALS-associated TDP-43 pathology in AD models.
21376022|a|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with loss of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. ALS is occasionally diagnosed with frontotemporal lobar dementia with ubiquitin-positive inclusions (FTLD-U). Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of age-associated dementia. Abnormal levels of aggregated Tar-DNA binding protein-43 (TDP-43) are detected in the majority of patients with ALS, FTLD and AD. We observed a significant increase (200%) in the levels of TDP-43 in cortical autopsies of late stage AD patients. Lentiviral expression of Abeta(1-42) in the rat motor cortex led to an increase in TDP-43 pathology, including up-regulation of the mature ~44kDa protein, identical to the pathological changes seen in AD. Furthermore, expression of Abeta(1-42) was associated with TDP-43 phosphorylation and accumulation in the cytosol. Clearance of Abeta with parkin prevented TDP-43 pathology. TDP-43 modifications were also observed in 3xTransgenic AD (3xTg-AD) compared to wild type mice, but these changes were attenuated in parkin-injected hippocampi, even in the presence of Tau pathology, suggesting that TDP-43 pathology is triggered by Abeta, independent of Tau. Increased levels of casein kinase (CK1 and CK2), which are associated with TDP-43 phosphorylation, were also observed in Abeta(1-42) expressing brains. These data indicate an overlap in TDP-43 pathology between AD and ALS-FTLD and suggest that Abeta triggers modifications of TDP-43.

21376667|t|Disease-associated amyloid and misfolded protein aggregates activate the inflammasome.
21376667|a|The pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis continues to be debated. Recently, the inflammasome protein complex has been shown to be a key regulator of IL-1beta, a cytokine implicated in each of these diseases. In all three cases, it is now apparent that unique protein aggregates caused by inappropriate oligomerization or misfolding are sensed by the inflammasome, providing a unifying mechanism for this IL-1beta production. What evolved as an innate defense against infection-related particles, therefore, now seems to be a driving force for inflammation in these diseases. This review discusses the basic research behind these findings and the potential for new therapeutic interventions this affords.

21376731|t|Pattern recognition with a fibril-specific antibody fragment reveals the surface variability of natural amyloid fibrils.
21376731|a|Amyloid immunotherapy has led to the rise of antibodies, which target amyloid fibrils or structural precursors of fibrils, based on their specific conformational properties. Recently, we reported the biotechnological generation of the B10 antibody fragment, which provides conformation-specific binding to amyloid fibrils. B10 strongly interacts with fibrils from Alzheimer's beta amyloid (Abeta) peptide, while disaggregated Abeta peptide or Abeta oligomers are not explicitly recognized. B10 also enables poly-amyloid-specific binding and recognizes amyloid fibrils derived from different types of amyloidosis or different polypeptide chains. Based on our current data, however, we find that B10 does not recognize all tested amyloid fibrils and amyloid tissue deposits. It also does not specifically interact with intrinsically unfolded polypeptide chains or globular proteins even if the latter encompass high beta-sheet content or beta-solenoid domains. By contrast, B10 binds amyloid fibrils from d-amino acid or l-amino acid peptides and non-proteinaceous biopolymers with highly regular and anionic surface properties, such as heparin and DNA. These data establish that B10 binding does not depend on an amyloid-specific or protein-specific backbone structure. Instead, it involves the recognition of a highly regular and anionic surface pattern. This specificity mechanism is conserved in nature and occurs also within a group of natural amyloid receptors from the innate immune system, the pattern recognition receptors. Our data illuminate the structural diversity of naturally occurring amyloid scaffolds and enable the discrimination of distinct fibril populations in vitro and within diseased tissues.

21377518|t|Plasma beta-amyloid peptides in canine aging and cognitive dysfunction as a model of Alzheimer's disease.
21377518|a|Aging dogs naturally demonstrate cognitive impairment and neuropathology that model early Alzheimer's disease (AD). In particular, there is evidence that canine cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CDS) in aged dogs is accompanied by cortical deposition of Abeta peptides and neurodegeneration. Plasma Abeta levels have been examined in humans as putative biomarkers for AD, but to date, no similar studies have been conducted for canine dementia. The aim of the present study was to assess plasma Abeta1-42 and Abeta1-40 levels in a blind study using pet dogs that were either successfully aging or exhibiting CDS. The severity of cognitive impairment was assessed using an owner-based questionnaire. On average, young dogs presented significantly higher plasma levels of Abeta1-42 and Abeta1-40 than aged, cognitively unimpaired dogs. Notably, among aged dogs, the levels of Abeta1-42 and the Abeta42/40 ratio were significantly higher in those showing mild cognitive impairment than in either cognitively unimpaired or severely affected dogs. These results suggest that increased plasma Abeta1-42 levels and Abeta42/40 ratio could be a biomarker for canine cognitive dysfunction, which is considered an excellent natural model of early AD.

21378096|t|Parkin mediates beclin-dependent autophagic clearance of defective mitochondria and ubiquitinated Abeta in AD models.
21378096|a|Intraneuronal amyloid-beta (Abeta) may contribute to extracellular plaque deposition, the characteristic pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The E3-ubiquitin ligase parkin ubiquitinates intracellular proteins and induces mitophagy. We previously demonstrated that parkin reduces Abeta levels in lentiviral models of intracellular Abeta. Here we used a triple transgenic AD (3xTg-AD) mouse, which over-expresses APP(Swe), Tau(P301L) and harbor the PS1(M146V) knock-in mutation and found that lentiviral parkin ubiquitinated intracellular Abeta in vivo, stimulated beclin-dependent molecular cascade of autophagy and facilitated clearance of vesicles containing debris and defective mitochondria. Parkin expression decreased intracellular Abeta levels and extracellular plaque deposition. Parkin expression also attenuated caspase activity, prevented mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress and restored neurotransmitter synthesis. Restoration of glutamate synthesis, which was independent of glial-neuronal recycling, depended on mitochondrial activity and led to an increase in gamma-amino butyric acid levels. These data indicate that parkin may be used as an alternative strategy to reduce Abeta levels and enhance autophagic clearance of Abeta-induced defects in AD. Parkin-mediated clearance of ubiquitinated Abeta may act in parallel with autophagy to clear molecular debris and defective mitochondria and restore neurotransmitter balance.

21381732|t|Rational design of beta-sheet ligands against Abeta42-induced toxicity.
21381732|a|A beta-sheet-binding scaffold was equipped with long-range chemical groups for tertiary contacts toward specific regions of the Alzheimer's Abeta fibril. The new constructs contain a trimeric aminopyrazole carboxylic acid, elongated with a C-terminal binding site, whose influence on the aggregation behavior of the Abeta(42) peptide was studied. MD simulations after trimer docking to the anchor point (F19/F20) suggest distinct groups of complex structures each of which featured additional specific interactions with characteristic Abeta regions. Members of each group also displayed a characteristic pattern in their antiaggregational behavior toward Abeta. Specifically, remote lipophilic moieties such as a dodecyl, cyclohexyl, or LPFFD fragment can form dispersive interactions with the nonpolar cluster of amino acids between I31 and V36. They were shown to strongly reduce Thioflavine T (ThT) fluorescence and protect cells from Abeta lesions (MTT viability assays). Surprisingly, very thick fibrils and a high beta-sheet content were detected in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and CD spectroscopic experiments. On the other hand, distant single or multiple lysines which interact with the ladder of stacked E22 residues found in Abeta fibrils completely dissolve existing beta-sheets (ThT, CD) and lead to unstructured, nontoxic material (TEM, MTT). Finally, the triethyleneglycol spacer between heterocyclic beta-sheet ligand and appendix was found to play an active role in destabilizing the turn of the U-shaped protofilament. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and sedimentation velocity analysis (SVA) provided experimental evidence for some smaller benign aggregates of very thin, delicate structure (TEM, MTT). A detailed investigation by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and other methods proved that none of the new ligands acts as a colloid. The evolving picture for the disaggregation mechanism by these new hybrid ligands implies transformation of well-ordered fibrils into less structured aggregates with a high molecular weight. In the few cases where fibrillar components remain, these display a significantly altered morphology and have lost their acute cellular toxicity.

21381744|t|The aggregation-enhancing huntingtin N-terminus is helical in amyloid fibrils.
21381744|a|The 17-residue N-terminus (htt(NT)) directly flanking the polyQ sequence in huntingtin (htt) N-terminal fragments plays a crucial role in initiating and accelerating the aggregation process that is associated with Huntington's disease pathogenesis. Here we report on magic-angle-spinning solid-state NMR studies of the amyloid-like aggregates of an htt N-terminal fragment. We find that the polyQ portion of this peptide exists in a rigid, dehydrated amyloid core that is structurally similar to simpler polyQ fibrils and may contain antiparallel beta-sheets. In contrast, the htt(NT) sequence in the aggregates is composed in part of a well-defined helix, which likely also exists in early oligomeric aggregates. Further NMR experiments demonstrate that the N-terminal helical segment displays increased dynamics and water exposure. Given its specific contribution to the initiation, rate, and mechanism of fibril formation, the helical nature of htt(NT) and its apparent lack of effect on the polyQ fibril core structure seem surprising. The results provide new details about these disease-associated aggregates and also provide a clear example of an amino acid sequence that greatly enhances the rate of amyloid formation while itself not taking part in the amyloid structure. There is an interesting mechanistic analogy to recent reports pointing out the early-stage contributions of transient intermolecular helix-helix interactions in the aggregation behavior of various other amyloid fibrils.

APP-BP1 expression was increased in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and in the subventricular zone of rats exposed to focal transient cerebral ischemia. In addition, APP-BP1 immunoreactivity overlapped with antidoublecortin and anti-5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine labeling. Focal transient cerebral ischemia has been reported earlier to induce neurogenesis in adult brains. The upregulation of APP-BP1 expression in neural progenitor cells after focal transient ischemia suggests that this protein contributes to the neurogenesis induced by transient ischemia and reperfusion.

21387368|a|The aborted trial of semagacestat has led some to invoke unanticipated effects of gamma-secretase inhibition on formation of amyloid beta. However, the many substrates for gamma-secretases and the varied biological effects of each of the resultant cleavage products make ascribing causality much more complex than that.

21387370|t|Apomorphine treatment in Alzheimer mice promoting amyloid-beta degradation.
21387370|a|OBJECTIVE: Intracellular amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) contributes to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer disease (AD). Apomorphine (APO) is a dopamine receptor agonist for Parkinson disease and also protects against oxidative stress. Efficacy of APO for an AD mouse model and effects of APO on cell cultures are studied. METHODS: The triple transgenic AD mouse model (3xTg-AD) has 2 familial AD-related gene mutations (APP(KM670/671NL) /PS1(M146V)) and a tau gene mutation (Tau(P301L)). Six-month-old 3xTg-AD mice were treated with subcutaneous injections of APO once a week for 1 month. Memory function was evaluated by Morris water maze before and after the treatment. Brain tissues were examined by immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting. Effects of APO on intracellular Abeta degradation, activity of Abeta-degrading enzymes, and protection against oxidative stress were studied in cultured SH-SY5Y cells. RESULTS: After APO treatment, short-term memory function was dramatically improved. Significant decreases in the levels of intraneuronal Abeta, hyper-phosphorylated tau (p-tau), p53, and heme oxygenase-1 proteins were observed. Moreover, APO promoted degradation of intracellular Abeta, increased activity of proteasome and insulin-degrading enzyme, protected against H(2) O(2) toxicity, and decreased p53 protein levels in the cultured cells. INTERPRETATION: 3xTg-AD mice show intraneuronal Abeta accumulation and memory disturbances before extracellular Abeta deposition. Our data demonstrating improvement of memory function of 3xTg-AD mice with decreases in intraneuronal Abeta and p-tau levels by APO treatment strongly suggest that intraneuronal Abeta is an important therapeutic target and APO will be a novel drug for AD.

21388281|t|Effects of external beam radiation on in vitro formation of Abeta1-42 fibrils and preformed fibrils.
21388281|a|Plaques containing fibrillar amyloid-beta (Abeta) are a characteristic finding in Alzheimer's disease. Although plaque counts correlate poorly with the extent of cognitive deficits in this disorder, fibrillar Abeta can promote neuronal damage through a variety of mechanisms. External beam radiotherapy has been reported to be an effective treatment for tracheobronchial amyloidosis, in which amyloid is deposited as submucosal plaques and tumor-like masses in the trachea and/or bronchi. Radiotherapy's effectiveness in this disorder is thought to be due to its toxicity to plasma cells, but direct effects of radiotherapy on amyloid may also be involved. On this basis, whole-brain radiotherapy has been suggested as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of external beam radiation on preformed Abeta1-42 fibrils and on the formation of these fibrils. Using the Thioflavin-T assay, no effects of radiation were found on either of these parameters. Our results in this in vitro study suggest that whole-brain irradiation is unlikely to directly reduce plaque counts in the Alzheimer's disease brain. This treatment might still lower plaque counts indirectly, but any potential benefits would need to be weighed against its possible neurotoxic effects, which could induce further cognitive deficits.

21388376|t|Proteomic study of the toxic effect of oligomeric Abeta1-42 in situ prepared from 'iso-Abeta1-42'.
21388376|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of neurodegenerative disorders even so the exact pathomechanism is still unclear. Recently, it is widely accepted that amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) toxicity is positively linked to Abeta oligomers, which may be responsible for the initiation of AD. For this reason, AD research requires well defined aggregation state and structure of Abeta. Precursor peptide 'iso-Abeta1-42' makes it possible to use Abeta1-42 with well- defined aggregation state for in vitro and in vivo experiments. The aim of this study was to identify protein expression changes from differentiated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells after treatment with oligomeric Abeta1-42 prepared in situ from 'iso-Abeta1-42'. In our experiment, a cell viability assay revealed a strong and time-dependent toxic effect of oligomeric Abeta1-42 which was supported by dramatic morphological changes. Our proteomics study also revealed numerous significant protein expression changes (22 proteins down- and 25 proteins up-regulated) after comparison of the untreated and Abeta1-42-treated cell lysates by two-dimensional electrophoresis. From the functional classification of the identified proteins, we found deregulations of proteins involved in metabolic processes, cytoskeleton organisation and protein biosynthesis and a huge number of up-regulated stress proteins displayed oligomeric Abeta1-42-induced cell stress.

21389082|t|The ER stress factor XBP1s prevents amyloid-beta neurotoxicity.
21389082|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder clinically characterized by progressive cognitive impairment. A prominent pathologic hallmark in the AD brain is the abnormal accumulation of the amyloid-beta 1-42 peptide (Abeta), but the exact pathways mediating Abeta neurotoxicity remain enigmatic. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is induced during AD, and has been indirectly implicated as a mediator of Abeta neurotoxicity. We report here that Abeta activates the ER stress response factor X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) in transgenic flies and in mammalian cultured neurons, yielding its active form, the transcription factor XBP1s. XBP1s shows neuroprotective activity in two different AD models, flies expressing Abeta and mammalian cultured neurons treated with Abeta oligomers. Trying to identify the mechanisms mediating XBP1s neuroprotection, we found that in PC12 cells treated with Abeta oligomers, XBP1s prevents the accumulation of free calcium (Ca(2+)) in the cytosol. This protective activity can be mediated by the downregulation of a specific isoform of the ryanodine Ca(2+) channel, RyR3. In support of this observation, a mutation in the only ryanodine receptor (RyR) in flies also suppresses Abeta neurotoxicity, indicating the conserved mechanisms between the two AD models. These results underscore the functional relevance of XBP1s in Abeta toxicity, and uncover the potential of XBP1 and RyR as targets for AD therapeutics.

21389247|t|Reduced spine density in specific regions of CA1 pyramidal neurons in two transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.
21389247|a|One major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the massive loss of synapses that occurs at an early clinical stage of the disease. In this study, we characterize alterations in spine density and the expression of synapse-associated immediate early gene Arc (activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein) in the hippocampal CA1 regions of two different amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mouse lines before plaque development and their connection to performance in hippocampus-dependent memory tests. The density of mushroom-type spines was reduced by 34% in the basal dendrites proximal to the soma of CA1 pyramidal neurons in 5.5-month-old Tg2576 mice, carrying the Swedish mutation, compared with wild-type littermates. A similar reduction of 42% was confirmed in the same region of 8-month-old APP/Lo mice, carrying the London mutation. In this strain, the reduction extended to the distal dendritic spines (28%), although no differences were found in apical dendrites in either transgenic mouse line. Both transgenic mice lines presented a significant increase in Arc protein expression in CA1 compared with controls, suggesting rather an overactivity and increased spine turnover that was supported by a significant decrease in number of somatostatin-immunopositive inhibitory interneurons in the stratum oriens of CA1. Behaviorally, the transgenic mice showed decrease freezing in the fear contextual conditioning test and impairment in spatial memory assessed by Morris water maze test. These data indicate that cognitive impairment in APP transgenic mice is correlated with impairment of synaptic connectivity in hippocampal CA1, probably attributable to loss of inhibitory interneurons and subsequent hyperactivity.

21389625|t|Protective effects of decursin and decursinol angelate against amyloid beta-protein-induced oxidative stress in the PC12 cell line: the role of Nrf2 and antioxidant enzymes.
21389625|a|The protective effects of decursin (D) and decursinol angelate (DA) purified from Angelica gigas Nakai on amyloid beta-protein (Abeta)-induced neurotoxicity and the underlying mechanisms were investigated. Abeta plays a major role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by eliciting oxidative stress. It significantly increased cytotoxicity and lipid peroxidation, but decreased glutathione contents and antioxidant enzyme activities. All of these results were markedly reversed by pretreatment with D or DA. Nuclear transcription factor Nrf2, which regulates the expression of antioxidant enzymes, was significantly increased by D or DA pretreatment. Furthermore, D and DA suppressed Abeta aggregation. These results suggest that D and DA increase cellular resistance to Abeta-induced oxidative injury in the rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells, presumably through not only the induction of Nrf2 and related antioxidant enzymes, but also the anti-aggregation of Abeta. Thus D and DA have therapeutic potential in treating AD and other oxidative stress-related diseases.

21389718|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: The nature and extent of adverse cognitive effects due to the prescription of anticholinergic drugs in older people with and without dementia is unclear. METHODS: We calculated the anticholinergic load (ACL) of medications taken by participants of the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study of ageing, a cohort of 211 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, 133 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients and 768 healthy controls (HC) all aged over 60 years. The association between ACL and cognitive function was examined for each diagnostic group (HC, MCI, AD). RESULTS: A high ACL within the HC group was associated with significantly slower response speeds for the Stroop color and incongruent trials. No other significant relationships between ACL and cognition were noted. CONCLUSION: In this large cohort, prescribed anticholinergic drugs appeared to have modest effects upon psychomotor speed and executive function, but not on other areas of cognition in healthy older adults.

21391232|t|CR1 is associated with amyloid plaque burden and age-related cognitive decline.
21391232|a|OBJECTIVE: Recently, genome-wide association studies have identified 3 new susceptibility loci for Alzheimer's disease (AD), CLU, CR1, and PICALM. We leveraged available neuropsychological and autopsy data from 2 cohort studies to investigate whether these loci are associated with cognitive decline and AD neuropathology. METHODS: The Religious Orders Study (ROS) and Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) are longitudinal studies that enroll nondemented subjects and include annual clinical evaluations and brain donation at death. We evaluated CR1 (rs6656401), CLU (rs11136000), and PICALM (rs7110631) in 1,666 subjects. We evaluated associations between genotypes and rate of change in cognitive function as well as AD-related pathology. Lastly, we used pathway analysis to determine whether relationships between single nucleotide polymorphisms and cognitive decline are mediated through AD pathology. RESULTS: Among our study cohort, the mean years of follow-up were 7.8 for ROS and 4.3 for MAP. Only the CR1 locus was associated with both global cognitive decline (p = 0.011) and global AD pathology (p = 0.025). More specifically, the locus affects the deposition of neuritic amyloid plaque (p = 0.009). In a mediation analysis, controlling for amyloid pathology strongly attenuated the effect of the CR1 locus on cognitive decline. INTERPRETATION: We found that common variation at the CR1 locus has a broad impact on cognition and that this effect is largely mediated by an individual's amyloid plaque burden. We therefore highlight 1 functional consequence of the CR1 susceptibility allele and generalize the role of this locus to cognitive aging in the general population.

21392515|t|5-HT(4) receptor agonist mediated enhancement of cognitive function in vivo and amyloid precursor protein processing in vitro: A pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic assessment.
21392515|a|There remains an urgent need for therapeutic agents that provide improved symptomatic treatment and attenuate disease progression in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). 5-HT(4) receptors are widely expressed in those CNS areas which receive substantial cholinergic input and are involved in cognition. The ability of 5-HT(4) receptor agonists to increase acetylcholine (ACh) release and reduce cognitive impairment in both animals and humans has been demonstrated. In addition, 5-HT(4) receptor agonist modulation of levels of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) derived peptides, soluble amyloid precursor protein (sAPPalpha) and amyloid beta protein (Abeta) in the CNS has been reported. In this study, the preclinical properties of three structurally-distinct 5-HT(4) receptor selective agonists, PRX-03140, velusetrag and TD-8954, were studied to assess their potential for symptomatic and disease-modifying benefit in the treatment of AD. All three compounds exhibited high affinity for the rat 5-HT(4) receptor but could be discriminated on the basis of their agonist activity. In cAMP accumulation and sAPPalpha secretion assays using recombinant HEK293f-5-HT(4(d))-APP(695) cells, velusetrag and TD-8954 were potent, full agonists, relative to 5-HT, whereas PRX-03140 was a partial agonist (intrinsic activity 18%, relative to 5-HT). In a guinea pig colon isolated tissue preparation, TD-8954 exhibited lower intrinsic activity than velusetrag, and PRX-03140 had negligible agonist activity. In the rat Morris water maze (MWM) cognition test, velusetrag and TD-8954 (0.1 mg/kg), but not PRX-03140 (0.03-1 mg/kg), significantly reversed the scopolamine-induced spatial learning deficit via activation of 5-HT(4) receptors. Coadministration of subefficacious doses of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEi), donepezil (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.), and either velusetrag or TD-8954 (0.01 mg/kg i.p.) resulted in reversal of the scopolamine-induced cognitive deficit. Pharmacokinetic data indicated that the CNS penetration for all three 5-HT(4) receptor agonists was relatively low. However, the pharmacodynamic-pharmacokinetic relationships in the MWM model for velusetrag and TD-8954 were consistent with their respective receptor pharmacology (binding affinity and intrinsic efficacy) and CNS penetration properties. Collectively, these findings support a potential role for potent and efficacious 5-HT(4) receptor agonists in the treatment of AD.

21394760|t|Dissociation of beta-amyloid from lipoprotein in cerebrospinal fluid from Alzheimer's disease accelerates beta-amyloid-42 assembly.
21394760|a|Monoclonal 2C3 specific to beta-amyloid (Abeta) oligomers (AbetaOs) enabled us to test our hypothesis that the alteration of lipoprotein-Abeta interaction in the central nervous system (CNS) initiates and/or accelerates the cascade favoring Abeta assembly. Immunoprecipitation of frontal cortex employing 2C3 unequivocally detected soluble 4-, 8-, and 12-mers in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. Immunoblot analysis of the entorhinal cortex employing 2C3 revealed that the accumulation of soluble 12-mers precedes the appearance of neuronal loss or cognitive impairment and is enhanced as the Braak neurofibrially tangle (NFT) stages progress. The dissociation of soluble Abeta from lipoprotein particles occurs in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and the presence of lipoprotein-free oligomeric 2C3 conformers (4- to 35-mers) was evident, which mimic CNS environments. Such CNS environments may strongly affect conformation of soluble Abeta peptides, resulting in the conversion of soluble Abeta(42) monomers into soluble Abeta(42) assembly. The findings suggest that functionally declined lipoproteins may accelerate the generation of metabolic conditions leading to higher levels of soluble Abeta(42) assembly in the CNS.

21396424|t|[6]-Gingerol attenuates beta-amyloid-induced oxidative cell death via fortifying cellular antioxidant defense system.
21396424|a|beta-Amyloid (Abeta) is involved in the formation of senile plaques, the typical neuropathological marker for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and has been reported to cause apoptosis in neurons via oxidative and/or nitrosative stress. In this study, we have investigated the neuroprotective effect and molecular mechanism of [6]-gingerol, a pungent ingredient of ginger against Alphabeta(25-35)-induced oxidative and/or nitrosative cell death in SH-SY5Y cells. [6]-Gingerol pretreatment protected against Abeta(25-35)-induced cytotoxicity and apoptotic cell death such as DNA fragmentation, disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, elevated Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, and activation of caspase-3. To elucidate the neuroprotective mechanism of [6]-gingerol, we have examined Abeta(25-35)-induced oxidative and/or nitrosative stress and cellular antioxidant defense system against them. [6]-Gingerol effectively suppressed Abeta(25-35)-induced intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen and/or nitrogen species and restored Abeta(25-35)-depleted endogenous antioxidant glutathione levels. Furthermore, [6]-gingerol treatment up-regulated the mRNA and protein expression of antioxidant enzymes such as gamma-glutamylcysteine ligase (GCL) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), the rate limiting enzymes in the glutathione biosynthesis and the degradation of heme, respectively. The expression of aforementioned antioxidant enzymes seemed to be mediated by activation of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). These results suggest that [6]-gingerol exhibits preventive and/or therapeutic potential for the management of AD via augmentation of antioxidant capacity.

21397006|t|Gender differences in neurotrophin and glutamate receptor expression in cholinergic nucleus basalis neurons during the progression of Alzheimer's disease.
21397006|a|The higher incidence rate of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in elderly women indicates that gender plays a role in AD pathogenesis. Evidence from clinical and pharmacologic studies, neuropathological examinations, and models of hormone replacement therapy suggest that cholinergic basal forebrain (CBF) cortical projection neurons within the nucleus basalis (NB), which mediate memory and attention and degenerate in AD, may be preferentially vulnerable in elderly women compared to men. CBF neurons depend on nerve growth factor (NGF) and their cognate receptors (trkA and p75(NTR)) for their survival and maintenance. We recently demonstrated a shift in the balance of NGF and its receptors toward cell death mechanisms during the progression of AD. To address whether gender affects NGF signaling system expression within the CBF, we used single cell RNA amplification and custom microarray technologies to compare gene expression profiles of single cholinergic NB neurons in tissue specimens from male and female members of the Religious Orders Study who died with a clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or mild/moderate AD. p75(NTR) expression within male cholinergic NB neurons was unchanged across clinical diagnosis, whereas p75(NTR) mRNA levels in female NB neurons exhibited a ~40% reduction in AD compared to NCI. Male AD subjects displayed a ~45% reduction in trkA mRNA levels within NB neurons compared to NCI and MCI. In contrast, NB neuronal trkA expression in females was reduced ~50% in both MCI and AD compared to NCI. Reduced trkA mRNA levels were associated with poorer global cognitive performance and higher Braak scores in the female subjects. In addition, we found a female-selective reduction in GluR2 AMPA glutamate receptor subunit expression in NB neurons in AD. These data suggest that cholinergic NB neurons in females may be at greater risk for degeneration during the progression of AD and support the concept of gender-specific therapeutic interventions during the preclinical stages of the disease.

21397508|t|Synthesis, biological evaluation and molecular modeling of novel triazole-containing berberine derivatives as acetylcholinesterase and beta-amyloid aggregation inhibitors.
21397508|a|A series of novel triazole-containing berberine derivatives were synthesized via the azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction. Their biological activity as inhibitors of both acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) were evaluated. Among them, compound 16d, which featured a diisopropylamino substitution at the 4-position of triazole ring, was found to be a potent inhibitor of AChE, with IC(50) value of 0.044 muM. Compound 18d, which beares a butyl at the 4-position of the triazole ring, showed the highest potency of beta-amyloid aggregation inhibition (77.9% at 20 muM). Molecular modeling studies indicated that the triazole moiety of berberine derivatives displayed a face-to-face pi-pi stacking interaction in a 'sandwich' form with the Trp84 (4.09 A) and Phe330 (4.33 A) in catalytic sites of AChE.

21397996|t|Benzophenone-based derivatives: a novel series of potent and selective dual inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase and acetylcholinesterase-induced beta-amyloid aggregation.
21397996|a|The leading mechanistic theory of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the "amyloid hypothesis" which states that the accumulation of the amyloid beta protein (Abeta), and its subsequent aggregation into plaques, is responsible for the initiation of a cascade of events resulting in neurodegeneration and dementia. The anti-amyloid disease-modifying approach, based on the decrease in the production of Abeta, gained thus a paramount importance. The aim of this study was the design and synthesis of a new series of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) endowed with anti-Abeta aggregating capability. These dual binding inhibitors, being able to interact both with the peripheral anionic site (PAS) of AChE and the catalytic subsite, proved to be able to inhibit the AChE-induced Abeta aggregation. Thus, starting from the lead compound 1, an AChEI composed by a benzophenone scaffold and a N,N'-methylbenzylamino group, a substantial modification aimed at targeting the PAS was performed. To this aim, different amino-terminal side chains were incorporated into this main framework, in order to mimic the diethylmethylammonium alkyl moiety of the pure PAS ligand propidium. The synthesized compounds proved to effectively and selectively inhibit AChE. Moreover, compounds 16a-c and 18a,b, with a propoxy and a hexyloxy tether respectively, showed a good activity against the AChE-induced Abeta aggregation. In particular, molecular modeling studies confirmed that compounds carrying the diethylaminopropoxy and the diethylaminohexyloxy side chains (compounds 16a and 19a, respectively) could suitably contact the PAS pocket of the enzyme.

21401483|t|Advances in structural and molecular neuroimaging in Alzheimer's disease.
21401483|a|Longer life expectancies lead to increases in the prevalence of age-associated illnesses. The number of Australians with dementia is predicted to rise, from 234,000 in 2009 to over 1 million by 2050, as a result of the increased prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia in the elderly. Early diagnosis of AD will become more important as disease-modifying therapies emerge within the next decade. Advances in molecular neuroimaging with amyloid-beta-specific radioligands for positron emission tomography, aided by magnetic resonance imaging techniques, allow detection of AD years before symptoms of dementia develop. Longitudinal prospective studies, such as the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study of ageing, will determine the sensitivity and specificity of these analysis techniques for diagnosing AD and predicting cognitive decline.

21402073|t|Transient formation of intermediate conformational states of amyloid-beta peptide revealed by heteronuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
21402073|a|A detailed analysis of the NMR spectra of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide revealed a decrease in signal intensity at higher temperature, due to a reversible conformational change of the molecule. Although peak intensity did not depend on peptide concentrations, the intensity in the region from D23 to A30 depended significantly on temperature. During the early stages of Abeta aggregation, each molecule might adopt transiently a turn conformation at around D23-A30, which converts mutually with a random coil. Stabilization of a turn by further conformational change and/or molecular association would lead to the formation of a "nucleus" for amyloid fibrils.

21403005|t|Using positron emission tomography and Carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B to image Brain Fibrillar beta-amyloid in adults with down syndrome: safety, acceptability, and feasibility.
21403005|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the safety, acceptability, and feasibility of positron emission tomography (PET) using carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B ([(11)C]PiB) to measure cerebral beta-amyloid in adults with Down syndrome (DS) and to explore if the technique differentiates between participants with and without Alzheimer disease (AD). DESIGN: Proof-of-principle case-controlled study of a nonrandomly selected cohort of participants with DS (with or without AD) compared within group and with healthy controls without DS. All had dynamic [(11)C]PiB PET and magnetic resonance imaging. Carbon 11-labeled PiB binding in the regions of interest associated with AD was quantitatively analyzed. SETTING: Wolfson Brain Imaging Centre, Cambridge, England. PARTICIPANTS: Nine with DS (aged 25-64 years), of whom 5 had a diagnosis of AD, and 14 healthy controls without DS (aged 33-69 years). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Positive [(11)C]PiB binding in regions of interest. RESULTS: The scanning process was feasible and acceptable with no adverse events or safety concerns. Maps and regional values of nondisplaceable binding potential were produced using the reference tissue-input Logan plot, with the cerebellum used as the reference tissue. When compared with the healthy control group without DS, only participants with DS older than 45 years had significant [(11)C]PiB binding in regions of interest usually associated with AD, whether or not they had clinical evidence of dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic [(11)C]PiB PET can be used successfully to measure cerebral beta-amyloid deposition in DS. A clinical diagnosis of AD and age appear to be predictors of [(11)C]PiB binding in regions of interest, but given the small numbers, we cannot generalize the results.

21403388|t|Stimulation of non-amyloidogenic processing of amyloid-beta protein precursor by cryptotanshinone involves activation and translocation of ADAM10 and PKC-alpha.
21403388|a|Cerebral deposition of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) plaques is now considered the central feature of Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies suggest that cryptotanshinone (CTS) extracted from the root of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge could be used for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we investigated the role of CTS on non-amyloidogenic processing of amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) as well as its regulation by protein kinase C (PKC). Treatment with CTS dose-dependently and significantly reduced both intracellular and secreted levels of Abeta40 and Abeta42 in N2a mouse neuroblastoma cells stably expressing human SwedishAbetaPP (N2a-SwedAbetaPP). Using N2a-SwedAbetaPP and human neuroblastoma SHSY5Y cells, it was demonstrated that CTS significantly and dose-dependently increased the production of sAbetaPPalpha and C-terminal fragment-alpha (CTF-alpha) from AbetaPP. At the same time, CTS specifically increased the maturation of "a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-10" (ADAM10), an alpha-secretase candidate. The increase of sAbetaPPalpha secretion by CTS was blocked by the hydroxamate-based inhibitors GI254023X and GW280264X, and by the PKC-alpha inhibitor GO6976, suggesting involvement of the ADAM10 and PKC-alpha in CTS-induced alpha-secretase cleavage. In other experiments, CTS induced the phosphorylation of PKC-alpha indicating that PKC-alpha is involved in CTS-induced sAbetaPPalpha secretion. Furthermore, treatment of neuroblastoma cells with CTS induced the co-translocation of ADAM10 and PKC-alpha to the cell membrane, the site at which AbetaPP was cleaved, and this translocation was significantly reduced by GO6976. These results suggest that CTS-induced sAbetaPPalpha secretion is regulated by a PKC-alpha and ADAM10 cascade in neuroblastoma cells and may be involved in the lowering of Abeta production.

21403390|t|Microglia demonstrate age-dependent interaction with amyloid-beta fibrils.
21403390|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-associated disease characterized by increased accumulation of extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques within the brain. Histological examination has also revealed profound microglial activation in diseased brains often in association with these fibrillar peptide aggregates. The paradoxical presence of increased, reactive microglia yet accumulating extracellular debris suggests that these cells may be phagocytically compromised during disease. Prior work has demonstrated that primary microglia from adult mice are unable to phagocytose fibrillar Abeta1-42 in vitro when compared to microglia cultured from early postnatal animals. These data suggest that microglia undergo an age-associated decrease in microglial ability to interact with Abeta fibrils. In order to better define a temporal profile of microglia-Abeta interaction, acutely isolated, rather than cultured, microglia from 2 month, 6 month, and postnatal day 0 C57BL/6 mice were compared. Postnatal day 0 microglia demonstrated a CD47 dependent ability to phagocytose Abeta fibrils that was lost by 6 months. This corresponded with the ability of postnatal day 0 but not adult microglia to decrease Abeta immunoreactive plaque load from AD sections in vitro. In spite of limited Abeta uptake ability, adult microglia had functional phagocytic uptake of bacterial bioparticles and demonstrated the ability to adhere to both Abeta plaques and in vitro fibrillized Abeta. These data demonstrate a temporal profile of specifically Abeta-microglia interaction with a critical developmental period at 6 months in which cells remain able to interact with Abeta fibrils but lose their ability to phagocytose it.

21403922|t|Chromatin acetylation, beta-amyloid precursor protein and its binding partner FE65 in DNA double strand break repair.
21403922|a|Among post-translational modifications of chromatin proteins taking place in DNA double strand break (DSB) repair, acetylation plays a prominent role. This review lists several facts and hypotheses concerning this process. Lack of acetyltransferase TIP60 (HIV-Tat interacting protein of 60 kDa) activity results in cells with defective DSB repair. The enzyme is present in the nucleus in a multimeric protein complex. TIP60 dependent activation of ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated kinase) is an early event in the response to DNA breakage. Other important acetylations are those of histones H4 and gammaH2AX. Correct reconstruction of the damaged site is critical for survival and prevention of genetic and epigenetic changes in the cell that may affect the function of its daughter cells. Recently, two proteins with previously unsuspected functions in DSB repair have been identified as active in this process: Alzheimer beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its binding partner FE65, beta-amyloid precursor binding protein. Their participation in DSB repair in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells is related to acetylation carried out by the acetyltransferase complex. The same function is ascribed to heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). So far, the relations (if any) between TIP60 activation by HP1 and by the FE65 complex remain unidentified.

21405042|t|Comparative studies of nontoxic and toxic amyloids interacting with membrane models at the air-water interface.
21405042|a|Many in vitro studies have pointed out the interaction between amyloids and membranes, and their potential involvement in amyloid toxicity. In a previous study, we generated a yeast toxic mutant (M8) of the harmless model amyloid protein HET-s((218-289)). In this study, we compared the self-assembling process of the nontoxic wild-type (WT) and toxic (M8) protein at the air-water interface and in interaction with various phospholipid monolayers (DOPE, DOPC, DOPI, DOPS and DOPG). We first demonstrate using ellipsometry measurements and polarization-modulated infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (PMIRRAS) that the air-water interface promotes and modifies the assembly of WT since an amyloid-like film was instantaneously formed at the interface with an antiparallel beta-sheet structuration instead of the parallel beta-sheet commonly observed for amyloid fibers generated in solution. The toxic mutant (M8) behaves in a similar manner at the air-water interface or in bulk, with a fast self-assembling and an antiparallel beta-sheet organization. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images established the fibrillous morphology of the protein films formed at the air-water interface. Second, we demonstrate for the first time that the main driving force between this particular fungus amyloid and membrane interaction is based on electrostatic interactions with negatively charged phospholipids (DOPG, DOPI, DOPS). Interestingly, the toxic mutant (M8) clearly induces perturbations of the negatively charged phospholipid monolayers, leading to a massive surface aggregation, whereas the nontoxic (WT) exhibits a slight effect on the membrane models. This study allows concluding that the toxicity of the M8 mutant could be due to its high propensity to interact with membranes.

21406231|t|Preventive and therapeutic types of environmental enrichment counteract beta amyloid pathology by different molecular mechanisms.
21406231|a|Combined preventive and therapeutic physical/cognitive stimulation starting before disease onset and continuing over its progression reduce Alzheimer-related pathology in transgenic mice. We now report that exposure of TgCRND8 mice to an enriched environment as either a preventive or therapeutic approach is also capable to reduce Abeta burden, though with different plaque and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) morphology. Preventive treatment resulted in fewer and smaller plaques without affecting CAA, whereas in therapeutically treated mice beside reduction of CAA extent, numerous plaques of strongly diminished size were found, so that total plaque loads declined as well. These effects seemed to be mediated by distinct molecular pathways. In preventive but not therapeutic group a shift of Abeta(42/40) ratio towards Abeta(40) and up-regulation of Abeta clearing and degrading molecules were found. Contrariwise anti-oxidative defense mechanisms were induced only in therapy but not preventive group. We hypothesize that preventive enrichment lowers the amounts of plaque seeds and decelerates plaque growth by degradation and clearance of Abeta, while therapeutic enrichment mitigates growth and fusion of plaque seeds to large plaques by inhibiting further Abeta aggregation. This study provides an experimental basis for application of physical/cognitive training in both prophylaxis and therapy of Alzheimer's disease.

21409417|t|Age-related changes of neuron numbers in the frontal cortex of a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
21409417|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by amyloid plaque accumulation, intracellular tangles and neuronal loss in selective brain regions. The frontal cortex, important for executive functioning, is one of the regions that are affected. Here, we investigated the neurodegenerative effects of mutant human amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS1) on frontal cortex neurons in APP/PS1KI mice, a transgenic mouse model of AD, expressing two mutations in the human APP, as well as two human PS1 mutations knocked-in into the mouse PS1 gene in a homozygous (ho) manner. Although the hippocampus is significantly affected in these mice, very little is known about the effects of these mutations on selective neuronal populations and plaque load in the frontal cortex. In this study, cytoarchitectural changes were characterized using high precision design-based stereology to evaluate plaque load, total neuron numbers, as well as total numbers of parvalbumin- (PV) and calretinin- (CR) immunoreactive (ir) neurons in the frontal cortex of 2- and 10-month-old APP/PS1KI mice. The frontal cortex was divided into two subfields: layers II-IV and layers V-VI, the latter of which showed substantially more extracellular amyloid-beta aggregates. We found a 34% neuron loss in layers V-VI in the frontal cortex of 10-month-old APP/PS1KI mice compared to 2-month-old, while there was no change in PV- and CR-ir neurons in these mice. In addition, the plaque load in layers V-VI of 10-month-old APP/PS1KI mice was only 11% and did not fully account for the extent of neuronal loss. Interestingly, an increase was found in the total number of PV-ir neurons in all frontal cortical layers of single transgenic APP mice and in layers II-IV of single transgenic PS1ho mice between 2 and 10 months of age. In conclusion, the APP/PS1KI mice provide novel insights into the regional selective vulnerability in the frontal cortex during AD that, together with previous findings in the hippocampus, are remarkably similar to the human situation.

21413795|t|Behavior of beta-amyloid 1-16 at the air-water interface at varying pH by nonlinear spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations.
21413795|a|The adsorption and aggregation of beta-amyloid (1-16) fragment at the air-water interface was investigated by the combination of second harmonic generation (SHG) spectroscopy, Brewster angle microscopy (BAM), and molecular dynamics simulations (MD). The Gibbs free energy of surface adsorption was measured to be -10.3 kcal/mol for bulk pHs of 7.4 and 3, but no adsorption was observed for pH 10-11. The 1-16 fragment is believed not to be involved in fibril formation of the beta-amyloid protein, but it exhibits interesting behavior at the air-water interface, as manifested in two time scales for the observed SHG response. The shorter time scale (minutes) reflects the surface adsorption, and the longer time scale (hours) reflects rearrangement and aggregation of the peptide at the air-water interface. Both of these processes are also evidenced by BAM measurements. MD simulations confirm the pH dependence of surface behavior of the beta-amyloid, with largest surface affinity found at pH = 7. It also follows from the simulations that phenylalanine is the most surface exposed residue, followed by tyrosine and histidine in their neutral form.

21413990|t|Regulated intramembrane proteolysis--lessons from amyloid precursor protein processing.
21413990|a|Regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) controls the communication between cells and the extracellular environment. RIP is essential in the nervous system, but also in other tissues. In the RIP process, a membrane protein typically undergoes two consecutive cleavages. The first one results in the shedding of its ectodomain. The second one occurs within its transmembrane domain, resulting in secretion of a small peptide and the release of the intracellular domain into the cytosol. The proteolytic cleavage fragments act as versatile signaling molecules or are further degraded. An increasing number of membrane proteins undergo RIP. These include growth factors, cytokines, cell adhesion proteins, receptors, viral proteins and signal peptides. A dysregulation of RIP is found in diseases, such as leukemia and Alzheimer's disease. One of the first RIP substrates discovered was the amyloid precursor protein (APP). RIP processing of APP controls the generation of the amyloid beta-peptide, which is believed to cause Alzheimer's disease. Focusing on APP as the best-studied RIP substrate, this review describes the function and mechanism of the APP RIP proteases with the goal to elucidate cellular mechanisms and common principles of the RIP process in general.

21414686|t|Intracellular Abeta-oligomers and early inflammation in a model of Alzheimer's disease.
21414686|a|Lifelong use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been shown to diminish the incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD), suggesting a key role of inflammation in early stages of the pathology. While amyloid plaque-associated inflammation has been extensively studied in human and animal models, little is known about the inflammatory process prior to plaque deposition, i.e., in preclinical stages of AD. In this study we investigated microglial and neuronal inflammatory markers in preplaque transgenic McGill-Thy1-APP mice. We found evidence that prior to plaque deposition classical markers of microglial activation such as major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II), inducible nitric oxide synthase (i-NOS), and CD40 are already upregulated in the hippocampus of transgenic mice. Microglial cells from transgenic mice in the preplaque stage displayed intermediately activated morphology and appeared to be recruited toward intracellular amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta)-oligomer burdened neurons. The inducible, neuron-specific cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) enzyme was found to be upregulated and specifically expressed by neurons in close relationship with Abeta-bearing cells, at this early stage of the AD-like pathology. Our study suggests that neuroinflammation might be one of the earliest pathological responses to intracellular accumulation of Abeta-oligomers.

21415543|t|Amyloid precursor protein binding protein Fe65 is cleaved by caspases during DNA damage-induced apoptosis.
21415543|a|Caspases cleave several cellular proteins to execute cell death by apoptosis. The identification of novel substrates of caspases could provide an important clue for elucidation of new apoptosis signaling pathways. In this study, we tested whether an amyloid precursor protein (APP) binding protein Fe65 is proteolytically degraded in neuronal cell death by apoptosis, using a neuron-like cell line, human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. When treated with DNA damaging agents, etoposide (ETP) and camptothecin (CPT), SH-SY5Y cells underwent apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, Fe65 (97 kDa) was cleaved to a 65 kDa product during DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, the cleavage of Fe65 was accompanied by activation of caspases-9 and -3. The restriction cleavage of Fe65 was completely suppressed by the treatment with a pan-caspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe) fluoromethylketone (z-VAD-fmk). These results reveal the restriction cleavage of Fe65 by caspases during DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Since Fe65 has been shown to suppress APP processing to amyloid beta (Abeta) production, our findings may provide a new insight into the molecular mechanism by which DNA damage induces Abeta production and subsequent neuronal cell death in Alzheimer's disease (AD).

21417461|t|Synthesis and structure-affinity relationships of novel dibenzylideneacetone derivatives as probes for beta-amyloid plaques.
21417461|a|A new and extensive set of dibenzylideneacetone derivatives was synthesized and screened for affinity toward Abeta(1-42) aggregates. Structure-activity relationships revealed the binding of dibenzylideneacetones to be affected by various substituents. The introduction of a substituent group in the ortho position reduced or abolished the binding. However, the para position was highly tolerant of sterically demanding substitutions. Three radioiodinated ligands (6, 70, and 71) and two (18)F fluoro-pegylated (FPEG) ligands (83 and 85) were prepared, all of which displayed high affinity for Abeta(1-42) aggregates (K(i) ranging from 0.9 to 7.0 nM). In biodistribution experiments, they exhibited good initial penetration (1.59, 4.68, 4.56, 4.13, and 5.15% ID/g, respectively, at 2 min) of and fast clearance from the brain. Autoradiography with sections of postmortem AD brain and transgenic mouse brain confirmed the high affinity of these tracers. These preliminary results strongly suggest the dibenzylideneacetone structure to be a potential new scaffold for beta-amyloid imaging probes.

21419111|t|Atorvastatin and pitavastatin protect cerebellar Purkinje cells in AD model mice and preserve the cytokines MCP-1 and TNF-alpha.
21419111|a|In contrast to cerebral cortical neurons, the extent of damage to cells of the cerebellum in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still a matter of debate. Here, we examined pathological changes in the cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) of AD model mice (amyloid precursor protein transgenic (APP-Tg) mice) at 10, 15, and 20 months (M) of age, and investigated the possible protective effect of two strong statins (atorvastatin at 30 mg/kg/day or pitavastatin at 3mg/kg/day, p.o.) by administering these statins from 5 to 20 M. The number of PCs detected by hematoxylin-eosin staining in APP-Tg mice was approximately 60% of the number in non-Tg mice at 10 M, and this progressively reduced with age until 20 M. Moreover, the number of monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1)-positive PCs and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)-positive PCs was also reduced in the transgenics. In contrast, the APP-Tg mice treated with either of the two statins showed a significant recovery in the number of PCs, and MCP-1 (at 20 M) and TNF-alpha (at 15 and 20 M) staining in PCs was preserved. Because MCP-1 and TNF-alpha play important roles in maintaining the synaptic network in PCs, the present study suggests that atorvastatin and pitavastatin can maintain the number of PCs and their synaptic networks in the AD cerebellum.

21419194|a|The risk of Alzheimer's disease increases following cerebral hypoperfusion. We studied the long-term interaction between low blood flow to the brain and Alzheimer's disease by inducing a transient global ischemic insult in aged 3xTg-AD mice and determining the effects on AD pathology 3-months post injury. We found that global ischemia does not increase the levels of amyloid-beta in these mice. However, the injury did lead to enhanced phosphorylation of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) at the Thr668 site in both the 3xTg-AD mice and wild-type controls. Furthermore, we found an increase in insoluble total tau 3-months post-injury. Together these findings further elucidate the long-term impact of cerebral hypoperfusion on Alzheimer's disease.

21419829|t|Alteration of the sialylation pattern and memory deficits by injection of Abeta(25-35) into the hippocampus of rats.
21419829|a|Sialic acid in glycoconjugates participates in important cellular functions associated with normal development, growth, and communication. Therefore we evaluated the sialylation pattern and memory deficits caused by the injection of Abeta((25-35)) into the hippocampus (Hp) of rats. The eight-arm maze spatial-learning and memory test indicated that the injection of Abeta((25-35)) into subfield CA1 of the Hp impaired both learning and memory. The sialylation pattern was examined using sialic acid-specific lectins. Our results showed that Maackia amurensis agglutinin (MAA, specific for Neu5Acalpha2,3Gal) showed reactivity in the CA1 and dentate gyrus (DG) subfields of the Hp mainly in the group injected with vehicle, whereas Macrobrachium rosenbergii lectin (MRL, specific for Neu5,9,7Ac) and Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA, specific for Neu5Acalpha2,6Gal-GalNAc) had increased reactivity in the CA1 and DG subfields of the Hp in the Abeta((25-35))-injected group. The staining pattern of the antibody specific for polysialic acid (a linear homopolymer of alpha-2,8-linked sialic acid) increased in the CA1 and DG subfields of the Hp of the Abeta((25-35)) group compared to the control group. Our results suggest that injection of Abeta((25-35)) causes impairment in spatial memory and alters the sialylation pattern in response to compensatory reorganization and-or sprouting of dendrites and axons of the surviving neurons.

21421841|t|Soluble amyloid beta-protein dimers isolated from Alzheimer cortex directly induce Tau hyperphosphorylation and neuritic degeneration.
21421841|a|Alzheimer disease is a major cause of cognitive failure, and a pathogenically related but more subtle process accounts for many cases of mild memory symptoms in older humans. Insoluble fibrillar plaques of amyloid beta-proteins (Abeta) and neurofibrillary deposits of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins are the diagnostic lesions of AD, but their temporal mechanistic relationship has long been debated. The recent recognition that small, diffusible oligomers may be the principal bioactive form of Abeta raises the key question of whether these are sufficient to initiate cytoskeletal change and neurite degeneration. A few studies have examined the effects of oligomers of synthetic Abeta peptides of one defined length at supraphysiological concentrations, but the existence of such assemblies in the AD brain is not established. Here, we isolated Abeta dimers, the most abundant form of soluble oligomer detectable in the human brain, from the cortices of typical AD subjects and found that at subnanomolar concentrations, they first induced hyperphosphorylation of tau at AD-relevant epitopes in hippocampal neurons and then disrupted the microtubule cytoskeleton and caused neuritic degeneration, all in the absence of amyloid fibrils. Application of pure, synthetic dimers confirmed the effects of the natural AD dimers, although the former were far less potent. Knocking down endogenous tau fully prevented the neuritic changes, whereas overexpressing human tau accelerated them. Coadministering Abeta N-terminal antibodies neutralized the cytoskeletal disruption. We conclude that natural dimers isolated from the AD brain are sufficient to potently induce AD-type tau phosphorylation and then neuritic dystrophy, but passive immunotherapy mitigates this.

21422279|t|Heparan sulfate/heparin promotes transthyretin fibrillization through selective binding to a basic motif in the protein.
21422279|a|Transthyretin (TTR) is a homotetrameric protein that transports thyroxine and retinol. Tetramer destabilization and misfolding of the released monomers result in TTR aggregation, leading to its deposition as amyloid primarily in the heart and peripheral nervous system. Over 100 mutations of TTR have been linked to familial forms of TTR amyloidosis. Considerable effort has been devoted to the study of TTR aggregation of these mutants, although the majority of TTR-related amyloidosis is represented by sporadic cases due to the aggregation and deposition of the otherwise stable wild-type (WT) protein. Heparan sulfate (HS) has been found as a pertinent component in a number of amyloid deposits, suggesting its participation in amyloidogenesis. This study aimed to investigate possible roles of HS in TTR aggregation. Examination of heart tissue from an elderly cardiomyopathic patient revealed substantial accumulation of HS associated with the TTR amyloid deposits. Studies demonstrated that heparin/HS promoted TTR fibrillization through selective interaction with a basic motif of TTR. The importance of HS for TTR fibrillization was illustrated in a cell model; TTR incubated with WT Chinese hamster ovary cells resulted in fibrillization of the protein, but not with HS-deficient cells (pgsD-677). The effect of heparin on TTR fibril formation was further demonstrated in a Drosophila model that overexpresses TTR. Heparin was colocalized with TTR deposits in the head of the flies reared on heparin-supplemented medium, whereas no heparin was detected in the nontreated flies. Heparin of low molecular weight (Klexane) did not demonstrate this effect.

21423194|t|Strain conformation, primary structure and the propagation of the yeast prion [PSI+].
21423194|a|Prion proteins can adopt multiple infectious strain conformations. Here we investigate how the sequence of a prion protein affects its capacity to propagate specific conformations by exploiting our ability to create two distinct infectious conformations of the yeast [PSI(+)] prion protein Sup35, termed Sc4 and Sc37. PNM2, a G58D point mutant of Sup35 that was originally identified for its dominant interference with prion propagation, leads to rapid, recessive loss of Sc4 but does not interfere with propagation of Sc37. PNM2 destabilizes the amyloid core of Sc37 and causes compensatory effects that slow prion growth but aid prion division and result in robust propagation of Sc37. By contrast, PNM2 does not affect the structure or chaperone-mediated division of Sc4 but interferes with its delivery to daughter cells. Thus, effective delivery of infectious particles during cell division is a crucial and conformation-dependent step in prion inheritance.

21424161|t|Complex pharmacokinetics of a humanized antibody against human amyloid beta peptide, anti-abeta Ab2, in nonclinical species.
21424161|a|PURPOSE: Anti-Abeta Ab2 (Ab2) is a humanized monoclonal antibody against amino acids 3-6 of primate (but not rodent) amyloid beta (Abeta) and is being evaluated for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study was conducted to predict the human pharmacokinetics of Ab2. METHODS: In vivo PK profile of Ab2 in preclinical species and in vitro mechanistic studies in preclinical and human systems were used for pharmacokinetic predictions. RESULTS: In Tg2576 and PSAPP mice that have ~100-fold higher circulating levels of human Abeta compared to humans, elimination of Ab2 was target-mediated, such that exposure was 5-10 fold lower compared to wild-type rodents or to PDAPP mice that have human Abeta concentrations in plasma similar to humans. In cynomolgus monkeys, the t(1/2) of Ab2 was faster (<2.5 days) compared to that of the control antibody (~13 days). The fast elimination of Ab2 in cynomolgus monkeys was linked to off-target binding to cynomolgus monkey fibrinogen that was also causing incomplete recovery of Ab2 in cynomolgus monkey serum in blood partitioning experiments. Ab2 had significantly weaker to undetectable binding to human (and mouse) fibrinogen and had good recovery in human serum in blood partitioning experiments. CONCLUSIONS: These data predict that elimination of Ab2 in healthy or AD humans is expected to be slow, with t(1/2) similar to that observed for other humanized antibodies.

21429624|t|Cognitive impairment and increased Abeta levels induced by paraquat exposure are attenuated by enhanced removal of mitochondrial H(2)O(2).
21429624|a|Pesticide exposure is a risk factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, little is known about how pesticide exposure may promote AD pathogenesis. In this study, we investigated the effects of paraquat pesticide exposure on beta-amyloid (Abeta) levels and cognition using wild-type (WT) mice and beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice. Our results showed that wild-type mice and APP transgenic mice after paraquat exposure had increased oxidative damage specifically in mitochondria of cerebral cortex and exhibited mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, the elevated mitochondrial damage was directly correlated with impaired associative learning and memory and increased Abeta levels in APP transgenic mice exposed to paraquat. Furthermore, overexpression of peroxiredoxin 3, a mitochondrial antioxidant defense enzyme important for H(2)O(2) removal, protected against paraquat-induced mitochondrial damage and concomitantly improved cognition and decreased Abeta levels in APP transgenic mice. Therefore, our results demonstrate that mitochondrial damage is a key mechanism underlying cognitive impairment and elevated amyloidogenesis induced by paraquat and that enhanced removal of mitochondrial H(2)O(2) could be an effective strategy to ameliorate AD pathogenesis induced by pesticide exposure.

21429865|t|Spatial patterns of brain amyloid-beta burden and atrophy rate associations in mild cognitive impairment.
21429865|a|Amyloid-beta accumulation in the brain is thought to be one of the earliest events in Alzheimer's disease, possibly leading to synaptic dysfunction, neurodegeneration and cognitive/functional decline. The earliest detectable changes seen with neuroimaging appear to be amyloid-beta accumulation detected by (11)C-labelled Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography imaging. However, some individuals tolerate high brain amyloid-beta loads without developing symptoms, while others progressively decline, suggesting that events in the brain downstream from amyloid-beta deposition, such as regional brain atrophy rates, play an important role. The main purpose of this study was to understand the relationship between the regional distributions of increased amyloid-beta and the regional distribution of increased brain atrophy rates in patients with mild cognitive impairment. To simultaneously capture the spatial distributions of amyloid-beta and brain atrophy rates, we employed the statistical concept of parallel independent component analysis, an effective method for joint analysis of multimodal imaging data. Parallel independent component analysis identified significant relationships between two patterns of amyloid-beta deposition and atrophy rates: (i) increased amyloid-beta burden in the left precuneus/cuneus and medial-temporal regions was associated with increased brain atrophy rates in the left medial-temporal and parietal regions; and (ii) in contrast, increased amyloid-beta burden in bilateral precuneus/cuneus and parietal regions was associated with increased brain atrophy rates in the right medial temporal regions. The spatial distribution of increased amyloid-beta and the associated spatial distribution of increased brain atrophy rates embrace a characteristic pattern of brain structures known for a high vulnerability to Alzheimer's disease pathology, encouraging for the use of (11)C-labelled Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography measures as early indicators of Alzheimer's disease. These results may begin to shed light on the mechanisms by which amyloid-beta deposition leads to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline and the development of a more specific Alzheimer's disease-specific imaging signature for diagnosis and use of this knowledge in the development of new anti-therapies for Alzheimer's disease.

21430171|t|In vivo positron emission tomographic imaging of glial responses to amyloid-beta and tau pathologies in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders.
21430171|a|Core pathologies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are aggregated amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) and tau, and the latter is also characteristic of diverse neurodegenerative tauopathies. These amyloid lesions provoke microglial activation, and recent neuroimaging technologies have enabled visualization of this response in living brains using radioligands for the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor also known as the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO). Here, we elucidated contributions of Abeta and tau deposits to in vivo TSPO signals in pursuit of mechanistic and diagnostic significance of TSPO imaging in AD and other tauopathies. A new antibody to human TSPO revealed induction of TSPO-positive microgliosis by tau fibrils in tauopathy brains. Emergence of TSPO signals before occurrence of brain atrophy and thioflavin-S-positive tau amyloidosis was also demonstrated in living mice transgenic for mutant tau by positron emission tomography (PET) with two classes of TSPO radioligands, [(11)C]AC-5216 and [(18)F]fluoroethoxy-DAA1106. Meanwhile, only modest TSPO elevation was observed in aged mice modeling Abeta plaque deposition, despite the notably enhanced in vivo binding of amyloid radiotracer, [(11)C]Pittsburgh Compound-B, to plaques. In these animals, [(11)C]AC-5216 yielded better TSPO contrasts than [(18)F]fluoroethoxy-DAA1106, supporting the possibility of capturing early neurotoxicity with high-performance TSPO probes. Furthermore, an additional line of mice modeling intraneuronal Abeta accumulation displayed elevated TSPO signals following noticeable neuronal loss, unlike TSPO upregulation heralding massive neuronal death in tauopathy model mice. Our data corroborate the utility of TSPO-PET imaging as a biomarker for tau-triggered toxicity, and as a complement to amyloid scans for diagnostic assessment of tauopathies with and without Abeta pathologies.

21435875|t|Proflavine derivatives as fluorescent imaging agents of amyloid deposits.
21435875|a|A series of proflavine derivatives for use to further image Abeta amyloid deposits were synthesized and characterized. Aged 3xTg-AD (23 months old) mice hippocampus sections incubated with these derivatives revealed preferential labeling of amyloid plaques. Furthermore an in vitro binding study showed an inhibitory effect, although moderate, of these compounds on Abeta(40) fibril formation. This study highlights the potential of proflavine as a molecular scaffold for designing new Abeta imaging agents, its native fluorescence allowing in vitro neuropathological staining in AD damaged brain sections.

21436112|t|18F-THK523: a novel in vivo tau imaging ligand for Alzheimer's disease.
21436112|a|While considerable effort has focused on developing positron emission tomography beta-amyloid imaging radiotracers for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, no radiotracer is available for the non-invasive quantification of tau. In this study, we detail the characterization of (18)F-THK523 as a novel tau imaging radiotracer. In vitro binding studies demonstrated that (18)F-THK523 binds with higher affinity to a greater number of binding sites on recombinant tau (K18Delta280K) compared with beta-amyloid(1-42) fibrils. Autoradiographic and histofluorescence analysis of human hippocampal serial sections with Alzheimer's disease exhibited positive THK523 binding that co-localized with immunoreactive tau pathology, but failed to highlight beta-amyloid plaques. Micro-positron emission tomography analysis demonstrated significantly higher retention of (18)F-THK523 (48%; P < 0.007) in tau transgenic mice brains compared with their wild-type littermates or APP/PS1 mice. The preclinical examination of THK523 has demonstrated its high affinity and selectivity for tau pathology both in vitro and in vivo, indicating that (18)F-THK523 fulfils ligand criteria for human imaging trials.

21440049|t|Arsenic affects expression and processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in primary neuronal cells overexpressing the Swedish mutation of human APP.
21440049|a|Arsenic poisoning due to contaminated water and soil, mining waste, glass manufacture, select agrochemicals, as well as sea food, affects millions of people world wide. Recently, an involvement of arsenic in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been hypothesized (Gong and O'Bryant, 2010). The present study stresses the hypothesis whether sodium arsenite, and its main metabolite, dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), may affect expression and processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), using the cholinergic cell line SN56.B5.G4 and primary neuronal cells overexpressing the Swedish mutation of APP, as experimental approaches. Exposure of cholinergic SN56.B5.G4 cells with either sodium arsenite or DMA decreased cell viability in a concentration- and exposure-time dependent manner, and affected the activities of the cholinergic enzymes acetylcholinesterase and choline acetyltransferase. Both sodium arsenite and DMA exposure of SN56.B5.G4 cells resulted in enhanced level of APP, and sAPP in the membrane and cytosolic fractions, respectively. To reveal any effect of arsenic on APP processing, the amounts of APP cleavage products, sAPPbeta, and beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides, released into the culture medium of primary neuronal cells derived from transgenic Tg2576 mice, were assessed by ELISA. Following exposure of neuronal cells by sodium arsenite for 12h, the membrane-bound APP level was enhanced, the amount of sAPPbeta released into the culture medium was slightly higher, while the levels of Abeta peptides in the culture medium were considerably lower as compared to that assayed in the absence of any drug. The sodium arsenite-induced reduction of Abeta formation suggests an inhibition of the APP gamma-cleavage step by arsenite. In contrast, DMA exposure of neuronal cells considerably increased formation of Abeta and sAPPbeta, accompanied by enhanced membrane APP level. The DMA-induced changes in APP processing may be the result of the enhanced APP expression. Alternatively, increased Abeta production may also be due to stimulation of caspase activity by arsenic compounds, or failure in Abeta degradation. In summary, the present report clearly demonstrates that sodium arsenite and DMA affect processing of APP in vitro.

21440575|t|A detailed analysis of the early context extinction deficits seen in APPswe/PS1dE9 female mice and their relevance to preclinical Alzheimer's disease.
21440575|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable age-related neurodegenerative condition, characterised by progressive decline in cognitive and physical functions, and extensive brain damage. Identifying cognitive deficits that accompany early AD is critical, as the accompanying synaptic changes can be effectively targeted by current treatments - at present AD is typically not diagnosed until brain pathology is established, and treatment relatively ineffective. We therefore examined early cognitive changes in 4-month-old mice over-expressing 2 genes responsible for AD (APPswe/PS1d9 mouse line). Experiment 1 tested 4-month-old female APPswe/PS1dE9 mice and their wild-type littermates on 4 validated tasks involving 8 cognitive and non cognitive measures. We observed a selective deficit in extinction of contextual fear in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. To extend the generality of this finding, Experiment 2 examined conditioning and extinction of an auditory stimulus paired with a sucrose reinforcer. No effect of genotype was observed. A third experiment investigated whether the context extinction impairment could be attributed to an attentional deficit. One conditioning stimulus (CS) was preexposed without consequence, and then it and a second, novel auditory CS were paired with food. Preexposure produced equal retardation of conditioning of the preexposed CS in both genotypes. However, in Experiment 2, and marginally in Experiment 3, additional tests revealed evidence of a selective impairment in context extinction in transgenic mice. These data suggest that context extinction deficits precede other cognitive impairments in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice, an effect that has intriguing parallels with findings in patients with mild AD.

21441028|a|BACE1 activity, inhibition of Abeta aggregation, and disaggregation of preformed Abeta fibrils constitute the three major targets in the development of small-molecule lipophilic new drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Quinones are widely distributed among natural products and possess relevant and varied biological activities including antitumor and antibiotic, inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, antidiabetic, or COX-inhibition, among others. We report herein the interaction of several arylquinones and their derivatives with the amyloidogenic pathway of the amyloid precursor protein processing. Our studies put forward that these compounds are promising candidates in the development of new drugs which are effective simultaneously towards the three major targets of AD.

21441306|t|Degradation of Alzheimer's amyloid fibrils by microglia requires delivery of ClC-7 to lysosomes.
21441306|a|Incomplete lysosomal acidification in microglia inhibits the degradation of fibrillar forms of Alzheimer's amyloid beta peptide (fAbeta). Here we show that in primary microglia a chloride transporter, ClC-7, is not delivered efficiently to lysosomes, causing incomplete lysosomal acidification. ClC-7 protein is synthesized by microglia but it is mistargeted and appears to be degraded by an endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway. Activation of microglia with macrophage colony-stimulating factor induces trafficking of ClC-7 to lysosomes, leading to lysosomal acidification and increased fAbeta degradation. ClC-7 associates with another protein, Ostm1, which plays an important role in its correct lysosomal targeting. Expression of both ClC-7 and Ostm1 is increased in activated microglia, which can account for the increased delivery of ClC-7 to lysosomes. Our findings suggest a novel mechanism of lysosomal pH regulation in activated microglia that is required for fAbeta degradation.

21444780|t|Calcium-dependent copper redistributions in neuronal cells revealed by a fluorescent copper sensor and X-ray fluorescence microscopy.
21444780|a|Dynamic fluxes of s-block metals like potassium, sodium, and calcium are of broad importance in cell signaling. In contrast, the concept of mobile transition metals triggered by cell activation remains insufficiently explored, in large part because metals like copper and iron are typically studied as static cellular nutrients and there are a lack of direct, selective methods for monitoring their distributions in living cells. To help meet this need, we now report Coppersensor-3 (CS3), a bright small-molecule fluorescent probe that offers the unique capability to image labile copper pools in living cells at endogenous, basal levels. We use this chemical tool in conjunction with synchotron-based microprobe X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XRFM) to discover that neuronal cells move significant pools of copper from their cell bodies to peripheral processes upon their activation. Moreover, further CS3 and XRFM imaging experiments show that these dynamic copper redistributions are dependent on calcium release, establishing a link between mobile copper and major cell signaling pathways. By providing a small-molecule fluorophore that is selective and sensitive enough to image labile copper pools in living cells under basal conditions, CS3 opens opportunities for discovering and elucidating functions of copper in living systems.

21446542|t|Fabrication of gold nanoparticle modified ITO substrate to detect beta-amyloid using surface-enhanced Raman scattering.
21446542|a|Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by the deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles in neurons. The Abeta peptide is a key molecule in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and an important marker for early diagnosis. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) has recently been attracting keen interest in various fields such as for biosensors or immunoassays. In this study, gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) were electrochemically deposited on an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate at different heights. Abeta antibodies were immobilized on the Au-NP-coated ITO substrate, after which the interactions between the antigen and the antibody were determined via SERS spectroscopy. The SERS responses were strongest at the Au NP array height of 91 nm, with a good linear relationship that corresponded to the change in the concentration of the antigen. This Au-NP-array-mediated SERS can be applied with a highly sensitive immunodetection biosensor.

21448224|t|Linking lipids to Alzheimer's disease: cholesterol and beyond.
21448224|a|Lipid-mediated signalling regulates a plethora of physiological processes, including crucial aspects of brain function. In addition, dysregulation of lipid pathways has been implicated in a growing number of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although much attention has been given to the link between cholesterol and AD pathogenesis, growing evidence suggests that other lipids, such as phosphoinositides and phosphatidic acid, have an important role. Regulators of lipid metabolism (for example, statins) are a highly successful class of marketed drugs, and exploration of lipid dysregulation in AD and identification of novel therapeutic agents acting through relevant lipid pathways offers new and effective options for the treatment of this devastating disorder.

21450370|t|Truncated tau and Abeta cooperatively impair mitochondria in primary neurons.
21450370|a|Mitochondrial dysfunction is likely a significant contributing factor to Alzheimer disease pathogenesis, and both amyloid peptide (Abeta) and pathological forms of tau may contribute to this impairment. Cleavage of tau at Asp421 occurs early in Alzheimer disease, and Asp421-cleaved tau likely negatively impacts neuronal function. Previously we showed that expression of Asp421-cleaved tau in a neuronal cell model resulted in mitochondrial impairment. To extend these findings we expressed either full length tau or Asp421-cleaved tau (truncated tau) in primary cortical neurons and measured different aspects of mitochondrial function with or without the addition of sublethal concentrations of Abeta. The expression of truncated tau alone induced significant mitochondrial fragmentation in neurons. When truncated tau expression was combined with Abeta at sublethal concentrations, increases in the stationary mitochondrial population and the levels of oxidative stress in cortical neurons were observed. Truncated tau expression also enhanced Abeta-induced mitochondrial potential loss in primary neurons. These new findings show that Asp421-cleaved tau and Abeta cooperate to impair mitochondria, which likely contributes to the neuronal dysfunction in Alzheimer disease.

21451522|t|Amyloid-binding compounds maintain protein homeostasis during ageing and extend lifespan.
21451522|a|Genetic studies indicate that protein homeostasis is a major contributor to metazoan longevity. Collapse of protein homeostasis results in protein misfolding cascades and the accumulation of insoluble protein fibrils and aggregates, such as amyloids. A group of small molecules, traditionally used in histopathology to stain amyloid in tissues, bind protein fibrils and slow aggregation in vitro and in cell culture. We proposed that treating animals with such compounds would promote protein homeostasis in vivo and increase longevity. Here we show that exposure of adult Caenorhabditis elegans to the amyloid-binding dye Thioflavin T (ThT) resulted in a profoundly extended lifespan and slowed ageing. ThT also suppressed pathological features of mutant metastable proteins and human beta-amyloid-associated toxicity. These beneficial effects of ThT depend on the protein homeostasis network regulator heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1), the stress resistance and longevity transcription factor SKN-1, molecular chaperones, autophagy and proteosomal functions. Our results demonstrate that pharmacological maintenance of the protein homeostatic network has a profound impact on ageing rates, prompting the development of novel therapeutic interventions against ageing and age-related diseases.

21452857|t|On a possible neutral charge state for the catalytic dyad in beta-secretase when bound to hydroxyethylene transition state analogue inhibitors.
21452857|a|beta-Secretase is one of the aspartic proteases involved in the formation of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease patients. Our previous results using a combination of surface plasmon resonance experiments with molecular modeling calculations suggested that the Asp dyad in beta-secretase bound to hydroxylethylene containing inhibitors adopts a neutral charged state. In this work, we show that the Asp dyad diprotonated state reproduced the binding ranking of a set of these inhibitors better than alternative protonation states.

21454574|t|Structure-dependent impairment of intracellular apolipoprotein E4 trafficking and its detrimental effects are rescued by small-molecule structure correctors.
21454574|a|Apolipoprotein (apo) E4 is the major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD) and likely contributes to neuropathology through various pathways. Here we report that the intracellular trafficking of apoE4 is impaired in Neuro-2a cells and primary neurons, as shown by measuring fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. In Neuro-2a cells, more apoE4 than apoE3 molecules remained immobilized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus, and the lateral motility of apoE4 was significantly lower in the Golgi apparatus (but not in the ER) than that of apoE3. Likewise, the immobile fraction was larger, and the lateral motility was lower for apoE4 than apoE3 in mouse primary hippocampal neurons. ApoE4 with the R61T mutation, which abolishes apoE4 domain interaction, was less immobilized, and its lateral motility was comparable with that of apoE3. The trafficking impairment of apoE4 was also rescued by disrupting domain interaction with the small-molecule structure correctors GIND25 and PH002. PH002 also rescued apoE4-induced impairments of neurite outgrowth in Neuro-2a cells and dendritic spine development in primary neurons. ApoE4 did not affect trafficking of amyloid precursor protein, another AD-related protein, through the secretory pathway. Thus, domain interaction renders more newly synthesized apoE4 molecules immobile and slows their trafficking along the secretory pathway. Correcting the pathological structure of apoE4 by disrupting domain interaction is a potential therapeutic approach to treat or prevent AD related to apoE4.

21454611|t|Structure of gamma-secretase and its trimeric pre-activation intermediate by single-particle electron microscopy.
21454611|a|The gamma-secretase membrane protein complex is responsible for proteolytic maturation of signaling precursors and catalyzes the final step in the production of the amyloid beta-peptides implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. The incorporation of PEN-2 (presenilin enhancer 2) into a pre-activation intermediate, composed of the catalytic subunit presenilin and the accessory proteins APH-1 (anterior pharynx-defective 1) and nicastrin, triggers the endoproteolysis of presenilin and results in an active tetrameric gamma-secretase. We have determined the three-dimensional reconstruction of a mature and catalytically active gamma-secretase using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. gamma-Secretase has a cup-like shape with a lateral belt of ~40-50 A in height that encloses a water-accessible internal chamber. Active site labeling with a gold-coupled transition state analog inhibitor suggested that the gamma-secretase active site faces this chamber. Comparison with the structure of a trimeric pre-activation intermediate suggested that the incorporation of PEN-2 might contribute to the maturation of the active site architecture.

21454701|t|Large quantities of Abeta peptide are constitutively released during amyloid precursor protein metabolism in vivo and in vitro.
21454701|a|The metabolism of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been extensively investigated because its processing generates the amyloid-beta-peptide (Abeta), which is a likely cause of Alzheimer disease. Much prior research has focused on APP processing using transgenic constructs and heterologous cell lines. Work to date in native neuronal cultures suggests that Abeta is produced in very large amounts. We sought to investigate APP metabolism and Abeta production simultaneously under more physiological conditions in vivo and in vitro using cultured rat cortical neurons and live pigs. We found in cultured neurons that both APP and Abeta are secreted rapidly and at extremely high rates into the extracellular space (2-4 molecules/neuron/s for Abeta). Little APP is degraded outside of the pathway that leads to extracellular release. Two metabolic pools of APP are identified, one that is metabolized extremely rapidly (t1/2;) = 2.2 h), and another, surface pool, composed of both synaptic and extrasynaptic elements, that turns over very slowly. Abeta release and accumulation in the extracellular medium can be accounted for stoichiometrically by the extracellular release of beta-cleaved forms of the APP ectodomain. Two alpha-cleavages of APP occur for every beta-cleavage. Consistent with the results seen in cultured neurons, an extremely high rate of Abeta production and secretion from the brain was seen in juvenile pigs. In summary, our experiments show an enormous and rapid production and extracellular release of Abeta and the soluble APP ectodomain. A small, slowly metabolized, surface pool of full-length APP is also identified.

21455713|a|A variable poly-T polymorphism in the TOMM40 gene, which is in linkage disequilibrium with APOE, was recently implicated with increased risk and earlier onset age for late-onset Alzheimer's disease in APOE epsilon3 carriers. To elucidate potential neurobiological mechanisms underlying this association, we compared the effect of TOMM40 poly-T variants to the effect of APOE, an established LOAD-risk modulator, on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid beta (Abeta) and tau levels, in cognitively intact elderly subjects. APOE epsilon4 carriers showed significant reductions in Abeta 1-42 levels compared to non-epsilon4 carriers, but no differences were detected across TOMM40 variants. Neither Abeta 1-40 nor tau levels were affected by APOE or TOMM40.

21457712|a|The aim of the present study was to analyse the alterations of cyclin dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) expression and phosphorylation in PC12 cells overexpressing amyloid precursor protein (APP). Our results demonstrated enhanced cell death and increased levels of mRNA for the Cdk5 gene in APP-transfected cells. Significantly decreased phosphorylation of Cdk5 at Tyr15 was observed in APPsw cells, which is responsible for a reduction in Cdk5 activity. Cdk5-dependent phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (Gsk-3beta) at Ser9 was also decreased, which can lead to the increase of Gsk-3beta activity and hyperphosphorylation of MAP tau. Our results demonstrate for the first time, a deregulation of Cdk5 phosphorylation in APP-transfected cells.

21457777|t|NADPH-oxidase activation and cognition in Alzheimer disease progression.
21457777|a|Superoxide production via NADPH-oxidase (NOX) has been shown to play a role in a variety of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer disease (AD). To improve our understanding of the NOX system and cognitive impairment, we studied the various protein components of the phagocytic isoform (gp91(phox), or NOX2) in the frontal and temporal cortex of age- and postmortem-matched samples. Individuals underwent antemortem cognitive testing and postmortem histopathologic assessment to determine disease progression and assignment to one of the following groups: no cognitive impairment (NCI), preclinical AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), early AD, and mild-to-moderate AD. Biochemical methods were used to determine overall NOX activity as well as levels of the various subunits (gp91(phox), p67(phox), p47(phox), p40(phox), and p22(phox)). Overall enzyme activity was significantly elevated in the MCI cohort in both cortical regions compared to the NCI cohort. This activity level remained elevated in the AD groups. Only the NOX cytosolic subunit proteins (p67(phox), p47(phox), and p40(phox) ) were significantly elevated with disease progression; the membrane-bound subunits (gp91(phox) and p22(phox)) remained stable. In addition, there was a robust correlation between NOX activity and the individual's cognitive status such that as the enzyme activity increased, cognitive performance decreased. Collectively, these data show that upregulated NADPH-oxidase in frontal and temporal cortex suggests that increases in NOX-associated redox pathways might participate in early pathogenesis and contribute to AD progression.

21458529|t|Thyroid hormone suppression of beta-amyloid precursor protein gene expression in the brain involves multiple epigenetic regulatory events.
21458529|a|Thyroid hormone (T3) suppresses cerebral gene expression of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP), an integral membrane protein that plays a key role in the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease. However, the mechanisms by which T3 signaling pathways inhibit APP gene transcription in the brain remain unclear. By carrying out chromatin immunoprecipitation with neuroblastoma cells and primary rat brain tissue, we show for the first time that thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) directly bind at the APP gene in vivo at a promoter region containing a negative T3-response element. We further show that T3 treatment decreases both histone H3 acetylation and histone H3 lysine 4 methylation at the APP promoter and that chemical inhibitors of histone deacetylases and histone lysine demethylase abrogate T3-dependent APP silencing. Our findings thus suggest that TRs actively facilitate T3-dependent silencing of APP gene expression via the recruitment of distinct histone modifying enzymes associated with transcriptional repression.

21459092|t|Amyloid beta-induced erythrocytic damage and its attenuation by carotenoids.
21459092|a|The presence of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) in human blood has recently been established, and it has been hypothesized that Abeta readily contacts red blood cells (RBC) and oxidatively impairs RBC functions. In this study, we conducted in vitro and in vivo studies, which provide evidence that Abeta induces oxidative injury to RBC by binding to them, causing RBC phospholipid peroxidation and diminishing RBC endogenous carotenoids, especially xanthophylls. This type of damage is likely to injure the vasculature, potentially reducing oxygen delivery to the brain and facilitating Alzheimer's disease (AD). As a preventive strategy, because the Abeta-induced RBC damage could be attenuated by treatment of RBC with xanthophylls, we suggest that xanthophylls may contribute to the prevention of AD.

21459473|t|The amyloid precursor protein and its homologues: structural and functional aspects of native and pathogenic oligomerization.
21459473|a|Over the last 25 years, remarkable progress has been made not only in identifying key molecules of Alzheimer's disease but also in understanding their meaning in the pathogenic state. One hallmark of Alzheimer pathology is the amyloid plaque. A major component of the extracellular deposit is the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide which is generated from its larger precursor molecule, i.e., the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by consecutive cleavages. Processing is exerted by two enzymes, i.e., the beta-secretase and the gamma-secretase. We and others have found that the self-association of the amyloid peptide and the dimerization and oligomerization of these proteins is a key factor under native and pathogenic conditions. In particular, the Abeta homodimer represents a nidus for plaque formation and a well defined therapeutic target. Further, dimerization of the APP was reported to increase generation of toxic Abeta whereas heterodimerization with its homologues amyloid precursor like proteins (APLP1 and APLP2) decreased Abeta formation. This review mainly focuses on structural features of the homophilic and heterophilic interactions among APP family proteins. The proposed contact sites are described and the consequences of protein dimerization on their functions and in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease are discussed.

21459773|t|Impaired mitochondrial dynamics and abnormal interaction of amyloid beta with mitochondrial protein Drp1 in neurons from patients with Alzheimer's disease: implications for neuronal damage.
21459773|a|The purpose of our study was to better understand the relationship between mitochondrial structural proteins, particularly dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) and amyloid beta (Abeta) in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using qRT-PCR and immunoblotting analyses, we measured mRNA and protein levels of mitochondrial structural genes in the frontal cortex of patients with early, definite and severe AD and in control subjects. We also characterized monomeric and oligomeric forms of Abeta in these patients. Using immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting analysis, we investigated the interaction between Abeta and Drp1. Using immunofluorescence analysis, we determined the localization of Drp1 and intraneuronal and oligomeric Abeta in the AD brains and primary hippocampal neurons from Abeta precursor protein (AbetaPP) transgenic mice. We found increased expression of the mitochondrial fission genes Drp1 and Fis1 (fission 1) and decreased expression of the mitochondrial fusion genes Mfn1 (mitofusin 1), Mfn2 (mitofusin 2), Opa1 (optic atrophy 1) and Tomm40. The matrix gene CypD was up-regulated in AD patients. Results from our qRT-PCR and immunoblotting analyses suggest that abnormal mitochondrial dynamics increase as AD progresses. Immunofluorescence analysis of the Drp1 antibody and the Abeta antibodies 6E10 and A11 revealed the colocalization of Drp1 and Abeta. Drp1 immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting analysis of Abeta antibodies 6E10 and A11 revealed that Drp1 interacts with Abeta monomers and oligomers in AD patients, and these abnormal interactions are increased with disease progression. Primary neurons that were found with accumulated oligomeric Abeta had lost branches and were degenerated, indicating that oligomeric Abeta may cause neuronal degeneration. These findings suggest that in patients with AD, increased production of Abeta and the interaction of Abeta with Drp1 are crucial factors in mitochondrial fragmentation, abnormal mitochondrial dynamics and synaptic damage. Inhibiting, these abnormal interactions may be a therapeutic strategy to reduce mitochondrial fragmentation, neuronal and synaptic damage and cognitive decline in patients with AD.

21460435|t|Changing perspectives on Alzheimer's disease: thinking outside the amyloid box.
21460435|a|The past two decades have seen an explosion in funding and research for Alzheimer's disease (AD), which has resulted in a wealth of data exploring the potential underlying processes, particularly with regard to amyloid-beta (Abeta). However, to date, therapies based on this knowledge have not been forthcoming. In seeking an explanation for our current pharmacological failures, it has become clear that amyloid is only one part of a multi-factorial disease process incorporating a wealth of deleterious factors. Additionally, there is strong evidence that the initial production of Abeta is part of the evolutionarily conserved stress response, triggered by a host of upstream factors highly altered in aging. Taken together, these observations place Abeta in a drastically different context, with toxicity occurring secondarily to upstream deleterious factors and rendering current therapeutic strategies oversimplified. This re-conceptualization necessitates a paradigm shift in our scientific and social response to AD, placing a greater emphasis on upstream interventions and public health awareness of the measures that can be taken by most individuals to reduce the risk of AD. With the increasing prevalence of AD and the realization that disease-modifying drugs may not be available in the near future, it is the responsibility of science to better communicate the worth of preventative healthcare measures to the public.

21460438|t|Characterization of amyloid-beta granules in the hippocampus of SAMP8 mice.
21460438|a|The senescence accelerated mouse-prone 8 (SAMP8) strain of mice is an experimental model of accelerated senescence that has also been proposed as a model of Alzheimer's disease as it shares several features with this dementia. We have recently reported amyloid-beta (Abeta) granules in the hippocampus of SAMP8 mice, which contain Abeta42 and Abeta40 peptides and other amyloid-beta protein precursor fragments. These granules appear clustered mainly in the stratum radiatum of the CA1 region and increase in number and size with age. Here we performed several studies to examine whether the Abeta granules in the hippocampus of SAMP8 mice contain other proteins characteristic of neuropathological aggregates, such as tau, MAP2, and alpha-synuclein. Moreover, we examined whether the Abeta granules in the hippocampus correspond to heparan sulphate proteoglycan (HSPG) positive granules previously described in this animal model. The results showed that Abeta granules correspond to the HSPG granular structures, being syndecan-2, a protein involved in the remodeling of dendritic spines, the type of HSPG found. Tau and MAP2, but not alpha-synuclein depositions, were also found in Abeta aggregates. Granules do not appear to have an astrocytic origin, since although some Abeta clusters are associated with astrocyte processes, most clusters are not. On the other hand, the presence of tau, MAP2, and NeuN in Abeta granules suggests a neuronal origin. As the components identified in Abeta granules are characteristic of the aggregates present in some neurodegenerative diseases, the SAMP8 model seems to be appropriate for the study of the processes involved in these pathologies.

21460439|t|Increased CSF-BACE1 activity associated with decreased hippocampus volume in Alzheimer's disease.
21460439|a|The enzyme beta-secretase (BACE1) is essentially involved in the production of cerebral amyloidogenic pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The measurement of BACE1 activity in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been reported, which may render CSF measurement of BACE1 a potential biomarker candidate of AD. In order to investigate whether BACE1 protein activity is correlated with regional brain atrophy in AD, we investigated the association between CSF levels of BACE1 and MRI-assessed hippocampus volume in patients with AD (n = 30). An increase in CSF-BACE1 activity was associated with decreased left and right hippocampus volume corrected for global head volume in the AD patients. Boot-strapped regression analysis showed that increased CSF levels of BACE1 activity were associated with increased CSF concentration of total tau but not amyloid-beta1-42 in AD. White matter hyperintensities did not influence the results. BACE1 activity and protein levels were significantly increased in AD compared to 19 elderly healthy controls. Thus, the CSF biomarker candidate of BACE1 activity was associated with hippocampus atrophy in AD in a robust manner and may reflect neurotoxic amyloid-beta-related processes.

21463452|t|No evidence of APP point mutation and locus duplication in individuals with cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
21463452|a|BACKGROUND: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a well-established cause of lobar intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Familial forms of CAA are because of mutations in the gene encoding the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and duplications of this gene can cause early-onset Alzheimer's disease associated with CAA. However, the contribution of APP genetic variants in the development of sporadic CAA remains unknown. METHODS: The presence of genetic variants in the APP was examined in 78 patients with CAA-related ICH by sequencing exons 16 and 17 coding the beta-amyloid protein and analyzing the presence of possible duplications of APP by microsatellite analysis and quantitative PCR. RESULTS: We did not identify any pathogenic mutation or chromosomal duplication of APP. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that APP genetic variants, point mutations and locus duplication, are not a common cause of CAA-related ICH in the Spanish population.

21463639|t|The crystal structure of death receptor 6 (DR6): a potential receptor of the amyloid precursor protein (APP).
21463639|a|Death receptors belong to the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) super family and are intimately involved in the signal transduction during apoptosis, stress response and cellular survival. Here we present the crystal structure of recombinantly expressed death receptor six (DR6), one family member that was recently shown to bind to the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and hence to be probably involved in the development of Alzheimer's disease. The extracellular cysteine rich region of DR6, the typical ligand binding region of all TNFRs, was refined to 2.2 A resolution and shows that its four constituting cysteine rich domains (CRDs) are arranged in a rod-like overall structure, which presents DR6-specific surface patches responsible for the exclusive recognition of its ligand(s). Based on the structural data, the general ligand binding modes of TNFRs and molecular modeling experiments we were able to elucidate structural features of the potential DR6-APP signaling complex.

21464208|t|Cysteine 27 variant of the delta-opioid receptor affects amyloid precursor protein processing through altered endocytic trafficking.
21464208|a|Agonist-induced activation of the delta-opioid receptor (deltaOR) was recently shown to augment beta- and gamma-secretase activities, which increased the production of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta), known to accumulate in the brain tissues of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Previously, the deltaOR variant with a phenylalanine at position 27 (deltaOR-Phe27) exhibited more efficient receptor maturation and higher stability at the cell surface than did the less common cysteine (deltaOR-Cys27) variant. For this study, we expressed these variants in human SH-SY5Y and HEK293 cells expressing exogenous or endogenous amyloid precursor protein (APP) and assessed the effects on APP processing. Expression of deltaOR-Cys27, but not deltaOR-Phe27, resulted in a robust accumulation of the APP C83 C-terminal fragment and the APP intracellular domain, while the total soluble APP and, particularly, the beta-amyloid 40 levels were decreased. These changes upon deltaOR-Cys27 expression coincided with decreased localization of APP C-terminal fragments in late endosomes and lysosomes. Importantly, a long-term treatment with a subset of deltaOR-specific ligands or a c-Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor suppressed the deltaOR-Cys27-induced APP phenotype. These data suggest that an increased constitutive internalization and/or concurrent signaling of the deltaOR-Cys27 variant affects APP processing through altered endocytic trafficking of APP.

21469206|t|Cerebrospinal fluid Tau/alpha-synuclein ratio in Parkinson's disease and degenerative dementias.
21469206|a|Although alpha-synuclein is the main constituent of Lewy bodies, cerebrospinal fluid determination on its own does not seem fundamental for the diagnosis of synucleinopathies. We evaluated whether the combination of classical biomarkers, Abeta(1-42) , total tau, phosphorylated tau, and alpha-synuclein can improve discrimination of Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, Alzheimer's disease, and frontotemporal dementia. Abeta(1-42) , total tau, phosphorylated tau, and alpha-synuclein were measured in a series of patients with Parkinson's disease (n = 38), dementia with Lewy bodies (n = 32), Alzheimer's disease (n = 48), frontotemporal dementia (n = 31), and age-matched control patients with other neurological diseases (n = 32). Mean alpha-synuclein levels in cerebrospinal fluid were significantly lower in the pathological groups than in cognitively healthy subjects. An inverse correlation of alpha-synuclein with total tau (r = -0.196, P < .01) was observed. In the group of patients with Parkinson's disease, Abeta(1-42) , total tau, and phosphorylated tau values were similar to controls, whereas total tau/alpha-synuclein and phosphorylated tau/alpha-synuclein ratios showed the lowest values. Cerebrospinal fluid alpha-synuclein alone did not provide relevant information for Parkinson's disease diagnosis, showing low specificity (area under the curve, 0.662; sensitivity, 94%; specificity, 25%). Instead, a better performance was obtained with the total tau/alpha-syn ratio (area under the curve, 0.765; sensitivity, 89%; specificity, 61%). Combined determination of alpha-synuclein and classical biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid shows differential patterns in neurodegenerative disorders. In particular, total tau/alpha-synuclein and phosphorylated tau/alpha-synuclein ratios can contribute to the discrimination of Parkinson's disease.   2011 Movement Disorder Society.

21469902|t|Highly nonlinear dynamics in a slowly sedimenting colloidal gel.
21469902|a|We use a combination of original light scattering techniques and particles with unique optical properties to investigate the behavior of suspensions of attractive colloids under gravitational stress, following over time the concentration profile, the velocity profile, and the microscopic dynamics. During the compression regime, the sedimentation velocity grows nearly linearly with height, implying that the gel settling may be fully described by a (time-dependent) strain rate. We find that the microscopic dynamics exhibit remarkable scaling properties when time is normalized by the strain rate, showing that the gel microscopic restructuring is dominated by its macroscopic deformation.

21471435|t|Alzheimer's disease: the challenge of the second century.
21471435|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) was first described a little more than 100 years ago. It is the most common cause of dementia with an estimated prevalence of 30 million people worldwide, a number that is expected to quadruple in 40 years. There currently is no effective treatment that delays the onset or slows the progression of AD. However, major scientific advances in the areas of genetics, biochemistry, cell biology, and neuroscience over the past 25 years have changed the way we think about AD. This review discusses some of the challenges to translating these basic molecular and cellular discoveries into clinical therapies. Current information suggests that if the disease is detected before the onset of overt symptoms, it is possible that treatments based on knowledge of underlying pathogenesis can and will be effective.

21471641|t|Endogenous galanin protects mouse hippocampal neurons against amyloid toxicity in vitro via activation of galanin receptor-2.
21471641|a|Expression of the neuropeptide galanin is known to be upregulated in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We and others have shown that galanin plays a neuroprotective role in a number of excitotoxic injury paradigms, mediated by activation of the second galanin receptor subtype (GAL2). In the present study, we investigated whether galanin/GAL2 plays a similar protective role against amyloid-beta(Abeta) toxicity. Here we report that galanin or the GAL2/3-specific peptide agonist Gal2-11, both equally protect primary dispersed mouse wildtype (WT) neonatal hippocampal neurons from 250 nM Abeta1-42 toxicity in a dose dependent manner. The amount of Abeta1-42 induced cell death was significantly greater in mice with loss-of-function mutations in galanin (Gal-KO) or GAL2 (GAL2-MUT) compared to strain-matched WT controls. Conversely, cell death was significantly reduced in galanin over-expressing (Gal-OE) transgenic mice compared to strain-matched WT controls. Exogenous galanin or Gal2-11 rescued the deficits in the Gal-KO but not the GAL2-MUT cultures, confirming that the protective effects of endogenous or exogenous galanin are mediated by activation of GAL2. Despite the high levels of endogenous galanin in the Gal-OE cultures, the addition of exogenous 100 nM or 50 nM galanin or 100 nM Gal2-11 further significantly reduced cell death, implying that GAL2-mediated neuroprotection is not at maximum in the Gal-OE mice. These data further support the hypothesis that galanin over-expression in AD is a neuroprotective response and imply that the development of a drug-like GAL2 agonist might reduce the progression of symptoms in patients with AD.

21473620|t|Characteristics of amyloid-related oligomers revealed by crystal structures of macrocyclic beta-sheet mimics.
21473620|a|Protein amyloid oligomers have been strongly linked to amyloid diseases and can be intermediates to amyloid fibers. beta-Sheets have been identified in amyloid oligomers. However, because of their transient and highly polymorphic properties, the details of their self-association remain elusive. Here we explore oligomer structure using a model system: macrocyclic peptides. Key amyloidogenic sequences from Abeta and tau were incorporated into macrocycles, thereby restraining them to beta-strands, but limiting the growth of the oligomers so they may crystallize and cannot fibrillate. We determined the atomic structures for four such oligomers, and all four reveal tetrameric interfaces in which beta-sheet dimers pair together by highly complementary, dry interfaces, analogous to steric zippers found in fibers, suggesting a common structure for amyloid oligomers and fibers. In amyloid fibers, the axes of the paired sheets are either parallel or antiparallel, whereas the oligomeric interfaces display a variety of sheet-to-sheet pairing angles, offering a structural explanation for the heterogeneity of amyloid oligomers.

21473952|t|Amyloid beta-HSP60 peptide conjugate vaccine treats a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
21473952|a|Active vaccination with amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) to induce beneficial antibodies was found to be effective in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but human vaccination trials led to adverse effects, apparently caused by exuberant T-cell reactivity. Here, we sought to develop a safer active vaccine for AD with reduced T-cell activation. We treated a mouse model of AD carrying the HLA-DR DRB1*1501 allele, with the Abeta B-cell epitope (Abeta 1-15) conjugated to the self-HSP60 peptide p458. Immunization with the conjugate led to the induction of Abeta-specific antibodies associated with a significant reduction of cerebral amyloid burden and of the accompanying inflammatory response in the brain; only a mild T-cell response specific to the HSP peptide but not to the Abeta peptide was found. This type of vaccination, evoking a gradual increase in antibody titers accompanied by a mild T-cell response is likely due to the unique adjuvant and T-cell stimulating properties of the self-HSP peptide used in the conjugate and might provide a safer approach to effective AD vaccination.

21477639|t|Restraint stress and repeated corticotrophin-releasing factor receptor activation in the amygdala both increase amyloid-beta precursor protein and amyloid-beta peptide but have divergent effects on brain-derived neurotrophic factor and pre-synaptic proteins in the prefrontal cortex of rats.
21477639|a|Both environmental stress and anxiety may represent important risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Previous studies demonstrate that restraint stress is associated with increased amyloid beta (Abeta) and decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in the brain. Abeta deposition, synaptic loss, and neurodegeneration define major hallmarks of AD, and BDNF is responsible for the maintenance of neurons. In contrast to restraint stress, repeated injections of sub-anxiogenic doses of the corticotrophin releasing factor receptor agonist urocortin1 (Ucn1) administered in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) of rats elicits persistent anxiety-like responses. We hypothesized that both restraint stress and Ucn1-induced anxiety would contribute to a neurobiological abnormality that would change the levels of Abeta precursor protein (APP) and Abeta as well as BDNF and pre-synaptic markers. In the first experiment, adult male Wister rats (n=5) were subjected to 3-h restraint, as compared to unstressed controls. In the second experiment, adult male Wistar rats (n=6) were subjected to sub-anxiogenic doses of Ucn1 (6 fmol/100 nl) administered in the BLA for 5 consecutive days, as compared to controls. Following each respective treatment, the social interaction (SI) test was performed to measure anxiety-like behavior. Protein studies were then conducted to quantify levels of APP, Abeta, BDNF and presynaptic proteins in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). In both experiments, we detected differences in either corticosterone levels or the SI test associated with a stress response. Furthermore, our findings indicate that both restraint stress and Ucn1 administration in the BLA lead to increased APP and Abeta deposition. However, restraint-induced stress leads to reductions in the levels of BDNF and presynaptic markers, while Ucn1-induced anxiety is associated with increases in the levels of each respective protein. This demonstrates a convergent role for stress response and Ucn1-induced anxiety in the regulation of APP and Abeta, but opposing roles for each respective treatment in the regulation of BDNF and presynaptic markers.

21478184|t|Cognitive reserve and Alzheimer's disease biomarkers are independent determinants of cognition.
21478184|a|The objective of this study was to investigate how a measure of educational and occupational attainment, a component of cognitive reserve, modifies the relationship between biomarkers of pathology and cognition in Alzheimer's disease. The biomarkers evaluated quantified neurodegeneration via atrophy on magnetic resonance images, neuronal injury via cerebral spinal fluid t-tau, brain amyloid-beta load via cerebral spinal fluid amyloid-beta1-42 and vascular disease via white matter hyperintensities on T2/proton density magnetic resonance images. We included 109 cognitively normal subjects, 192 amnestic patients with mild cognitive impairment and 98 patients with Alzheimer's disease, from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study, who had undergone baseline lumbar puncture and magnetic resonance imaging. We combined patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease in a group labelled 'cognitively impaired' subjects. Structural Abnormality Index scores, which reflect the degree of Alzheimer's disease-like anatomic features on magnetic resonance images, were computed for each subject. We assessed Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (cognitive behaviour section) and mini-mental state examination scores as measures of general cognition and Auditory-Verbal Learning Test delayed recall, Boston naming and Trails B scores as measures of specific domains in both groups of subjects. The number of errors on the American National Adult Reading Test was used as a measure of environmental enrichment provided by educational and occupational attainment, a component of cognitive reserve. We found that in cognitively normal subjects, none of the biomarkers correlated with the measures of cognition, whereas American National Adult Reading Test scores were significantly correlated with Boston naming and mini-mental state examination results. In cognitively impaired subjects, the American National Adult Reading Test and all biomarkers of neuronal pathology and amyloid load were independently correlated with all cognitive measures. Exceptions to this general conclusion were absence of correlation between cerebral spinal fluid amyloid-beta1-42 and Boston naming and Trails B. In contrast, white matter hyperintensities were only correlated with Boston naming and Trails B results in the cognitively impaired. When all subjects were included in a flexible ordinal regression model that allowed for non-linear effects and interactions, we found that the American National Adult Reading Test had an independent additive association such that better performance was associated with better cognitive performance across the biomarker distribution. Our main conclusions included: (i) that in cognitively normal subjects, the variability in cognitive performance is explained partly by the American National Adult Reading Test and not by biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease pathology; (ii) in cognitively impaired subjects, the American National Adult Reading Test, biomarkers of neuronal pathology (structural magnetic resonance imaging and cerebral spinal fluid t-tau) and amyloid load (cerebral spinal fluid amyloid-beta1-42) all independently explain variability in general cognitive performance; and (iii) that the association between cognition and the American National Adult Reading Test was found to be additive rather than to interact with biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease pathology.

21479849|t|In vivo demonstration of amyloid burden in posterior cortical atrophy: a case series with PET and CSF findings.
21479849|a|Our objective was to evaluate amyloid deposition in posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), using both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker analysis and amyloid imaging. Five PCA patients, selected based on their neuropsychological profile and atrophic changes in posterior regions on MRI, underwent CSF analysis. CSF amyloid-beta 1-42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 levels were determined. They also had positron emission tomography (PET) with Pittsburgh Compound B ([(11)C]PIB). [(11)C]PIB ratio images were assessed with visual, regional and voxel-based analyses and compared to eight typical Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and eight controls. The biological profile in the five PCA patients, resulting from CSF and [(11)C]PIB images analysis, was consistent with AD. Individual comparisons of PCA patients' [(11)C]PIB images with the AD group with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) revealed a distinctive posterior uptake in four out of the five patients showing increased amyloid deposition in occipital, temporal, and/or parietal regions. ROI group analysis showed a tendency for higher amyloid deposition in occipital and temporal regions. However, this pattern was not found with SPM group analysis when the global level of [(11)C]PIB uptake was used as a covariate. Our results indicate that amyloid burden can be demonstrated in vivo in PCA suggesting a diagnosis of AD. PCA patients may present a higher global amyloid load than AD that was not related to age at onset, disease severity, disease duration, or educational level in our study. Combined CSF and PET biomarkers seem helpful for in vivo diagnosis of this focal syndrome with underlying AD pathology.

21480376|t|The relationship between plasma amyloid-beta peptides and the medial temporal lobe in the homebound elderly.
21480376|a|BACKGROUND: The ratio of high amyloid-beta peptide40 (Abeta40) and low Abeta42 in plasma predicts the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is associated with episodic recall in depression. We thus examined the relationship between plasma Abeta levels and brain volumes. METHODS: Homebound elders (N = 352) who had undergone brain MRI were used. Plasma Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 were measured by ELISA. Volumes of medial temporal regions, including the amygdala and hippocampus, were manually measured. RESULTS: Amygdala volume was associated with log(10) of plasma Abeta1-42 (beta = +0.19, SE = 0.07, p = 0.005) after adjusting for AD, infarcts, white matter hyperintensities and demographics. In the absence of dementia, decreasing quartiles of plasma Abeta1-42 (Mean + SD ml: Q4 = 4.1 +- 0.8; Q3 = 3.9 +- 0.7; Q2 = 3.6 +- 0.8 and Q1 = 3.7 +- 0.8, p = 0.01) and increasing quartiles of plasma Abeta1-40/1-42 ratio were associated with smaller amygdala volume. Those depressed subjects with a high plasma Abeta1-40/1-42 ratio had smaller amygdala (Mean + SD ml: 3.3 +- 0.8 vs. 3.6 +- 0.8, p = 0.04) and total brain volume (Mean + SD liter: 0.95 +- 0.07 vs. 1.04 +- 0.12, p = 0.005), and had a higher rate of MCI (67 vs. 36%, p = 0.02) than those with a low plasma Abeta1-40/1-42 ratio. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of low plasma Abeta1-42 concentration and atrophy of the medial temporal lobe structures, which regulates mood and cognition, may represent a biomarker for a prodromal stage of AD.

21480689|t|Outcome-specific satiety reveals a deficit in context-outcome, but not stimulus- or action-outcome, associations in aged Tg2576 mice.
21480689|a|The onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is often accompanied by changes in emotion, motivation, and goal-directed behavior. The production of beta-amyloid is thought to be a major and early contributor to the pathogenesis of AD. The present study tested the hypothesis that amyloid pathology present in the amygdala, frontal cortex, and hippocampus of Tg2576 mice would disrupt the development of instrumental- and/or Pavlovian-outcome associations. The results showed that both instrumental- and Pavlovian-conditioned behaviors were sensitive to outcome devaluation (Experiments 1 & 2) and that Pavlovian cues influenced goal-directed actions associated with the same outcome (Experiment 2) in Tg2576 mice. In contrast, context mediated Pavlovian-conditioned behaviors in aged (Experiment 3a) but not young (Experiment 3b) Tg2576 mice were insensitive to outcome devaluation. Aged Tg2576, nevertheless, successfully acquired a simple context discrimination at the same rate as control mice. We conclude that amyloid pathology in aged Tg2576 mice may specifically disrupt context-outcome associations supported by the hippocampus and/or its interaction with the amygdala.

21482827|t|Amyloid beta-mediated cell death of cultured hippocampal neurons reveals extensive Tau fragmentation without increased full-length tau phosphorylation.
21482827|a|A variety of genetic and biochemical evidence suggests that amyloid beta (Abeta) oligomers promote downstream errors in Tau action, in turn inducing neuronal dysfunction and cell death in Alzheimer and related dementias. To better understand molecular mechanisms involved in Abeta-mediated neuronal cell death, we have treated primary rat hippocampal cultures with Abeta oligomers and examined the resulting cellular changes occurring before and during the induction of cell death with a focus on altered Tau biochemistry. The most rapid neuronal responses upon Abeta administration are activation of caspase 3/7 and calpain proteases. Abeta also appears to reduce Akt and Erk1/2 kinase activities while increasing GSK3beta and Cdk5 activities. Shortly thereafter, substantial Tau degradation begins, generating relatively stable Tau fragments. Only a very small fraction of full-length Tau remains intact after 4 h of Abeta treatment. In conflict with expectations based on suggested increases of GSK3beta and Cdk5 activities, Abeta does not cause any major increases in phosphorylation of full-length Tau as assayed by immunoblotting one-dimensional gels with 11 independent site- and phospho-specific anti-Tau antibodies as well as by immunoblotting two-dimensional gels probed with a pan-Tau antibody. There are, however, subtle and transient increases in Tau phosphorylation at 3-4 specific sites before its degradation. Taken together, these data are consistent with the notion that Abeta-mediated neuronal cell death involves the loss of full-length Tau and/or the generation of toxic fragments but does not involve or require hyperphosphorylation of full-length Tau.

21483096|t|High throughput monitoring of amyloid-beta(42) assembly into soluble oligomers achieved by sensitive conformation state-dependent immunoassays.
21483096|a|Accumulation of small soluble assemblies of amyloid-beta (Abeta)(42) in the brain is thought to play a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. As a result, there has been much interest in finding small molecules that inhibit the formation of synaptotoxic Abeta(42) oligomers that necessitates sensitive methods for detecting the initial steps in the oligomerization of Abeta(42). Modeling suggests that oligomerized Abeta(42) adopts a conformation in which the C-terminus is embedded in the center, whereas the N-terminus is exposed at the periphery of the oligomer. Here we report that an inverse change in Abeta(42) C-terminal and N-terminal epitope accessibility provides the basis of a sensitive method for assessing early steps in Abeta(42) oligomerization. Using ELISA and AlphaLISA, we found that Abeta(42) C-terminal immunoreactivity decreased in a time- and concentration-dependent manner under conditions favoring oligomerization. This reduction was accompanied by an increase in the N-terminal immunoreactivity, suggesting that assemblies with multiple exposed N-terminal epitopes were detected. Importantly the assay generates a robust window between monomers and oligomers at as low as 1 nM Abeta(42). Using this assay, known oligomerization inhibitors produced a dose-dependent unmasking of the Abeta(42) C-terminal epitope. After automation, the assay proved to be highly reproducible and effective for high throughput screening of small molecules that inhibit Abeta(42) oligomerization.

21483097|t|Cholesterol and amyloid-beta: evidence for a cross-talk between astrocytes and neuronal cells.
21483097|a|Accumulating data supports the concept that alterations of cholesterol metabolism might influence the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides in the brain. Changes in the neuronal production of Abeta have been described as a function of cholesterol levels, thus suggesting a causal link between cholesterol homeostasis dysregulation and AD pathogenesis. Under physiological conditions, cholesterol uptake in the brain is efficiently prevented by the blood-brain barrier, and mature neurons are thought to rely on glial cells for their cholesterol supply. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that Abeta may serve as a signaling molecule capable of informing the astroglial network about the neuronal need for cholesterol. Collectively, our data bolster this hypothesis and demonstrate, for the first time, that Abeta(42) exerts an inhibitory effect on the expression of the cholesterol transporter ABCA1 in cultured astrocytes. Accordingly, we also show that ABCA1 expression is reduced in the brain of AbetaPP/PS1 transgenic mice. These results provide a biological function for Abeta peptides and may help to define the pathogenic relationship between cholesterol metabolism in brain and AD.

21486050|t|Characterizing the structural behavior of selected Abeta-42 monomers with different solubilities.
21486050|a|The conformational behavior of the wild-type amyloid beta-42 (Abeta-42) monomer and two of its mutants was explored via all-atom replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent, to identify structural features that may promote or deter early-stage oligomerization. The markers used for this purpose indicate that while the three peptides are relatively flexible they have distinct preferential structures and degree of rigidity. In particular, we found that one mutant that remains in the monomeric state in experiments displays a characteristic N-terminal structure that significantly enhances its rigidity. This finding is consistent with various studies that have detected a reduction in oligomerization frequency and Abeta-related toxicity upon sequence-specific antibody or ligand binding to the N-terminal tail of wild-type monomers, likely leading to the stabilization of this region. In general, our results highlight a potential role of the N-terminal segment on Abeta oligomerization and give insights into specific interactions that may be responsible for promoting the pronounced structural changes observed upon introducing point mutations on the wild-type Abeta-42 peptide.

21487594|t|Effects of all-atom force fields on amyloid oligomerization: replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations of the Abeta(16-22) dimer and trimer.
21487594|a|The aim of this work is to investigate the effects of molecular mechanics force fields on amyloid peptide assembly. To this end, we performed extensive replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations on the monomer, dimer and trimer of the seven-residue fragment of the Alzheimer's amyloid-beta peptide, Abeta(16-22), using the AMBER99, GROMOS96 and OPLS force fields. We compared the force fields by analysing the resulting global and local structures as well as the free energy landscapes at 300 K. We show that AMBER99 strongly favors helical structures for the monomer and does not predict any beta-sheet structure for the dimer and trimer. In contrast, the dimer and trimer modeled by GROMOS96 form antiparallel beta-sheet structures, while OPLS predicts diverse structures. Overall, the free energy landscapes obtained by three force fields are very different, and we also note a weak structural dependence of our results on temperature. The implications of this computational study on amyloid oligomerization, fibril growth and inhibition are also discussed.

21488093|t|Intraneuronal amyloid beta oligomers cause cell death via endoplasmic reticulum stress, endosomal/lysosomal leakage, and mitochondrial dysfunction in vivo.
21488093|a|Intraneuronal accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) is an early pathological change in Alzheimer's disease. Previously, we showed that the E693Delta mutation (referred to as the "Osaka" mutation) of amyloid precursor protein (APP) caused intracellular accumulation of Abeta oligomers and apoptosis in transfected COS-7 cells. We also showed that transgenic mice expressing APP(E693Delta) (APP(OSK) ) displayed both an age-dependent accumulation of intraneuronal Abeta oligomers from 8 months of age and apparent neuronal loss in the hippocampus at 24 months of age. These findings indicate that intraneuronal Abeta oligomers cause cell death, but the mechanism of this process remains unclear. Accordingly, here we investigated the subcellular localization and toxicity of intraneuronal Abeta oligomers in APP(OSK) -transgenic mice. We found Abeta oligomer accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), endosomes/lysosomes, and mitochondria in hippocampal neurons of 22-month-old mice. We also detected up-regulation of Grp78 and HRD1 (an E3 ubiquitin ligase), leakage of cathepsin D from endosomes/lysosomes into cytoplasm, cytochrome c release from mitochondria, and activation of caspase-3 in the hippocampi of 18-month-old mice. Collectively, our findings suggest that intraneuronal Abeta oligomers cause cell death by inducing ER stress, endosomal/lysosomal leakage, and mitochondrial dysfunction in vivo.   2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

21489805|a|A recombinant form of BACE1 (beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1) corresponding to positions 46-454 of the extracellular domain of the original membrane enzyme was prepared. The recombinant BACE1 (rBACE1) had the kinetic parameters K(m)=5.5muM and k(cat)=1719s(-1). Using several libraries of substrates containing unnatural amino acids, the specificity of rBACE1 was evaluated.

21490054|t|Neuronal dysfunction and disconnection of cortical hubs in non-demented subjects with elevated amyloid burden.
21490054|a|Disruption of functional connectivity between brain regions may represent an early functional consequence of beta-amyloid pathology prior to clinical Alzheimer's disease. We aimed to investigate if non-demented older individuals with increased amyloid burden demonstrate disruptions of functional whole-brain connectivity in cortical hubs (brain regions typically highly connected to multiple other brain areas) and if these disruptions are associated with neuronal dysfunction as measured with fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography. In healthy subjects without cognitive symptoms and patients with mild cognitive impairment, we used positron emission tomography to assess amyloid burden and cerebral glucose metabolism, structural magnetic resonance imaging to quantify atrophy and novel resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging processing methods to calculate whole-brain connectivity. Significant disruptions of whole-brain connectivity were found in amyloid-positive patients with mild cognitive impairment in typical cortical hubs (posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus), strongly overlapping with regional hypometabolism. Subtle connectivity disruptions and hypometabolism were already present in amyloid-positive asymptomatic subjects. Voxel-based morphometry measures indicate that these findings were not solely a consequence of regional atrophy. Whole-brain connectivity values and metabolism showed a positive correlation with each other and a negative correlation with amyloid burden. These results indicate that disruption of functional connectivity and hypometabolism may represent early functional consequences of emerging molecular Alzheimer's disease pathology, evolving prior to clinical onset of dementia. The spatial overlap between hypometabolism and disruption of connectivity in cortical hubs points to a particular susceptibility of these regions to early Alzheimer's-type neurodegeneration and may reflect a link between synaptic dysfunction and functional disconnection.

21490199|t|Amyloid beta-induced impairments in hippocampal synaptic plasticity are rescued by decreasing mitochondrial superoxide.
21490199|a|Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) causes cellular oxidative damage and has been implicated in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In contrast, multiple lines of evidence indicate that ROS can normally modulate long-term potentiation (LTP), a cellular model for memory formation. We recently showed that decreasing the level of superoxide through the overexpression of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD-2) prevents memory deficits in the Tg2576 mouse model of AD. In the current study, we explored whether AD-related LTP impairments could be prevented when ROS generation from mitochondria was diminished either pharmacologically or via genetic manipulation. In wild-type hippocampal slices treated with exogenous amyloid beta peptide (Abeta1-42) and in slices from APP/PS1 mutant mice that model AD, LTP was impaired. The LTP impairments were prevented by MitoQ, a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, and EUK134, an SOD and catalase mimetic. In contrast, inhibition of NADPH oxidase either by diphenyliodonium (DPI) or by genetically deleting gp91(phox), the key enzymatic component of NADPH oxidase, had no effect on Abeta-induced LTP blockade. Moreover, live staining with MitoSOX Red, a mitochondrial superoxide indicator, combined with confocal microscopy, revealed that Abeta-induced superoxide production could be blunted by MitoQ, but not DPI, in agreement with our electrophysiological findings. Finally, in transgenic mice overexpressing SOD-2, Abeta-induced LTP impairments and superoxide generation were prevented. Our data suggest a causal relationship between mitochondrial ROS imbalance and Abeta-induced impairments in hippocampal synaptic plasticity.

21490226|t|Naturally occurring autoantibodies against beta-amyloid: investigating their role in transgenic animal and in vitro models of Alzheimer's disease.
21490226|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder primarily affecting regions of the brain responsible for higher cognitive functions. Immunization against beta-amyloid (Abeta) in animal models of AD has been shown to be effective on the molecular level but also on the behavioral level. Recently, we reported naturally occurring autoantibodies against Abeta (NAbs-Abeta) being reduced in Alzheimer's disease patients. Here, we further investigated their physiological role: in epitope mapping studies, NAbs-Abeta recognized the mid-/C-terminal end of Abeta and preferentially bound to oligomers but failed to bind to monomers/fibrils. NAbs-Abeta were able to interfere with Abeta peptide toxicity, but NAbs-Abeta did not readily clear senile plaques although early fleecy-like plaques were reduced. Administration of NAbs-Abeta in transgenic mice improved the object location memory significantly, almost reaching performance levels of wild-type control mice. These findings suggest a novel physiological mechanism involving NAbs-Abeta to dispose of proteins or peptides that are prone to forming toxic aggregates.

21490323|t|Alzheimer-signature MRI biomarker predicts AD dementia in cognitively normal adults.
21490323|a|OBJECTIVE: Since Alzheimer disease (AD) neuropathology is thought to develop years before dementia, it may be possible to detect subtle AD-related atrophy in preclinical AD. Here we hypothesized that the "disease signature" of AD-related cortical thinning, previously identified in patients with mild AD dementia, would be useful as a biomarker to detect anatomic abnormalities consistent with AD in cognitively normal (CN) adults who develop AD dementia after longitudinal follow-up. METHODS: We studied 2 independent samples of adults who were CN when scanned. In sample 1, 8 individuals developing AD dementia (CN-AD converters) after an average of 11.1 years were compared to 25 individuals who remained CN (CN-stable). In sample 2, 7 CN-AD converters (average follow-up 7.1 years) were compared to 25 CN-stable individuals. RESULTS: AD-signature cortical thinning in CN-AD converters in both samples was remarkably similar, about 0.2 mm (p < 0.05). Despite this small absolute difference, Cohen d effect sizes for these differences were very large (> 1). Of the 11 CN individuals with baseline low AD-signature thickness (>= 1 SD below cohort mean), 55% developed AD dementia over nearly the next decade, while none of the 9 high AD-signature thickness individuals (>= 1 SD above mean) developed dementia. This marker predicted time to diagnosis of dementia (hazard ratio = 3.4, p < 0.0005); 1 SD of thinning increased dementia risk by 3.4. CONCLUSIONS: By focusing on cortical regions known to be affected in AD dementia, subtle but reliable atrophy is identifiable in asymptomatic individuals nearly a decade before dementia, making this measure a potentially important imaging biomarker of early neurodegeneration.

21491887|t|Substantial contribution of the two imidazole rings of the His13-His14 dyad to Cu(II) binding in amyloid-beta(1-16) at physiological pH and its significance.
21491887|a|The interaction of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide with Cu(II) appears to play an important role in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease. At physiological pH, the Cu(II) coordination in Abeta is heterogeneous, and there exist at least two binding modes in which Cu(II) is coordinated by histidine residues. Electron spin resonance studies have revealed a picture of the Cu(II) binding at a higher or lower pH, where only one of the two binding modes is almost exclusively present. We describe a procedure to directly examine the coordination of Cu(II) to each histidine residue in the dominant binding mode at physiological pH. We use nonlabeled and residue-specifically (15)N-labeled Abeta(1-16). For quantitative analysis, the intensities of three-pulse electron spin-echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) spectra are analyzed. Spectral simulations show that ESEEM intensities provide information about the contribution of each histidine residue. Indeed, the ESEEM experiments at pH 6.0 confirm the dominant contribution of His6 to the Cu(II) coordination as expected from the work of other researchers. Interestingly, however, the ESEEM data obtained at pH 7.4 reveal that the contributions of the three residues to the Cu(II) coordination are in the order of His14   His6 > His13 in the dominant binding mode. The order indicates a significant contribution from the simultaneous coordination by His13 and His14 at physiological pH, which has been underappreciated. These findings are supported by hyperfine sublevel correlation spectroscopy experiments. The simultaneous coordination by the two adjacent residues is likely to be present in a non-beta-sheet structure. The coexistence of different secondary structures is possibly the molecular origin for the formation of amorphous aggregates rather than fibrils at relatively high concentrations of Cu(II). Through our approach, precise and useful information about Cu(II) binding in Abeta(1-16) at physiological pH is obtained without any side-chain modification, amino acid residue replacement, or pH change, each of which might lead to an alteration in the peptide structure or the coordination environment.

21492779|t|Radioiodinated benzimidazole derivatives as single photon emission computed tomography probes for imaging of beta-amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease.
21492779|a|Five iodinated 2-phenyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazole derivatives were synthesized and evaluated as potential probes for beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques. One of the compounds, 4-(6-iodo-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)-N,N-dimethylaniline (12), showed excellent affinity for Abeta(1-42) aggregates (K(i) = 9.8 nM). Autoradiography with sections of postmortem Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain revealed that a radioiodinated probe [(125)I]12, labeled Abeta plaques selectively with low nonspecific binding. Biodistribution experiments with normal mice injected intravenously with [(125)I]12 showed high uptake [4.14 percent injected dose per gram (% ID/g) at 2 min] into and rapid clearance (0.15% ID/g at 60 min) from the brain, which may bring about a good signal-to-noise ratio and therefore achieve highly sensitive detection of Abeta plaques. In addition, [(125)I]12 labeled amyloid plaques in vivo in an AD transgenic model. The preliminary results strongly suggest that [(125)I]12 bears characteristics suitable for detecting amyloid plaques in vivo. When labeled with (123)I, it may be a useful SPECT imaging agent for Abeta plaques in the brain of living AD patients.

21496477|t|Protective effects of bone morphogenetic protein 7 against amyloid-beta induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells.
21496477|a|Bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7) has neuroprotective effects against ischemia, oxidation stress, and lipopolysaccharide, but its role on amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we exposed PC12 cells to Abeta25-35 for 26 h to induce neurotoxicity, and added exogenous BMP7 at 2 h to observe the neuroprotective effects. The protective mechanisms involved, mostly related to inhibition of cell apoptosis and oxidation stress, were analyzed. In rat in vivo experiments, we bilaterally injected Abeta1-40 into the basal forebrain to simulate neuropathological processes in AD, performed the Morris water maze test to evaluate the effect of Abeta on spatial learning and memory, and explored the change of endogenous BMP7 expression in the brain. The present study demonstrated that BMP7 prevented neuronal injuries in PC12 cells induced by Abeta25-35, including cell apoptosis and morphological impairment of dendrites as well as oxidation stress. BMP7 treatment significantly protected PC12 cells against Abeta25-35-induced injury and inhibited the increasing content of the Bax gene and the decreasing activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD). Abeta1-40 bilaterally injected into the rat basal forebrain obviously inhibited the rat's spatial learning ability and memory, and significantly induced downregulation of endogenous BMP7 in the basal forebrain while upregulating it in the hippocampus. Our results suggest that BMP7 has neuroprotective effects against Abeta, which may be mediated through inhibition of Bax gene expression during cell apoptosis and elevation of SOD activities during the oxidative stress response. On the other hand, endogenous BMP7 may have a potential self-modulation capacity through negative feedback between the region of the basal forebrain and the hippocampus as a protective cytokine.

21496499|t|Tetrandrine suppresses amyloid-beta-induced inflammatory cytokines by inhibiting NF-kappaB pathway in murine BV2 microglial cells.
21496499|a|Microglial cells play an important role in mediating neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) by production of a series of proinflammatory mediators and clearance of Abeta peptides and senile plaques. Tetrandrine, a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid isolated from the Chinese herb Radix Stephania tetrandra, has been demonstrated to decrease the expression of proinflammatory mediators by inhibition of NF-kappaB activation. Here we investigated whether tetrandrine may affect the phagocytosis of microglia and the expression of cytokines and NF-kappaB in murine BV2 microglial cells. We found that fibrillar Amyloid-beta (fAbeta) induced phagocytosis of microglia and dramatically increased the levels of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1beta) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) as well as the expression of phospho NF-kappaB p65 in microglia cultures. The treatment with tetrandrine resulted in downregulation of phospho NF-kappaB p65 expression and strikingly reduced the production of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha. However, tetrandrine did not affect fAbeta induced phagocytosis of microglia. In conclusion, tetrandrine can decrease microglial detriment of neurotoxicity while maintaining microglial benefit of neuroprotection. Tetrandrine may be an efficacious and promising remedy in the treatment of AD.

21497122|t|Death-associated protein kinase 1 phosphorylates Pin1 and inhibits its prolyl isomerase activity and cellular function.
21497122|a|Pin1 is a phospho-specific prolyl isomerase that regulates numerous key signaling molecules and whose deregulation contributes to disease notably cancer. However, since prolyl isomerases are often believed to be constitutively active, little is known whether and how Pin1 catalytic activity is regulated. Here, we identify death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1), a known tumor suppressor, as a kinase responsible for phosphorylation of Pin1 on Ser71 in the catalytic active site. Such phosphorylation fully inactivates Pin1 catalytic activity and inhibits its nuclear location. Moreover, DAPK1 inhibits the ability of Pin1 to induce centrosome amplification and cell transformation. Finally, Pin1 pSer71 levels are positively correlated with DAPK1 levels and negatively with centrosome amplification in human breast cancer. Thus, phosphorylation of Pin1 Ser71 by DAPK1 inhibits its catalytic activity and cellular function, providing strong evidence for an essential role of the Pin1 enzymatic activity for its cellular function.

21497565|t|Validation and implementation of a liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry assay for quantitation of the total and unbound RO4929097, a gamma-secretase inhibitor targeting Notch signaling, in human plasma.
21497565|a|A reversed-phased liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for quantitation of the total and unbound RO4929097, a gamma-secretase inhibitor targeting Notch signaling, in human plasma. Sample preparation involved a liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a Waters X-Terra  MS C(18) column with an isocratic mobile phase consisting of methanol/0.45% formic acid in water (60:40, v/v) running at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min for 6 min. The lower limits of quantitation (LLOQs) were 5 ng/ml for the total RO4929097 in plasma and 0.5 ng/ml for the unbound drug in phosphate buffer solution (PBS). Calibration curves were linear over RO4929097 concentration range of 5-2000 ng/ml in plasma for the total drug and 0.5-200 ng/ml in PBS for the unbound drug. The intra-day and inter-day accuracy and precision were within the generally accepted criteria for bioanalytical method (<15%). The method has been successfully employed to characterize the total and unbound plasma pharmacokinetics of RO4929097 after its oral administration in cancer patients.

21497592|t|Selective dihydropyiridine compounds facilitate the clearance of beta-amyloid across the blood-brain barrier.
21497592|a|Increasing evidence suggests that the soluble form of the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Previously, we reported that treatment with certain antihypertensive dihydropyridine (DHP) compounds can mitigate Abeta production in whole cells and reduce brain Abeta burden in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. As Abeta clearance across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a key regulatory step in the deposition of Abeta in the brain, we examined the effect of DHP treatment on Abeta brain clearance. Treatment with certain DHP compounds significantly increased Abeta(1-42) transcytosis across the BBB in an in vitro model. The rank order of these compounds was nitrendipine>nicardipine=cilnidipine=lercanidipine>nimodipine>azelnidipine=nilvadipine. Conversely, amlodipine, felodipine, isradipine, and nifedipine had no effect on Abeta(1-42) BBB transcytosis. In an in vivo paradigm of Abeta clearance across the BBB, peripheral administration of nitrendipine, cilnidipine, and nilvadipine to wild-type animals facilitated the brain clearance of centrally administered exogenous Abeta(1-42), whereas with amlodipine, there was no effect. We also observed improved cognitive function in mice treated with nilvadipine following central Abeta(1-42) insult. Thus, in addition to the effect of certain DHP compounds on Abeta production, we demonstrate that certain DHP compounds also facilitate the clearance of Abeta across the BBB. This dual mechanism of action may be particularly effective in attenuating Abeta brain burden in Alzheimer's disease and could open the door to a new class of therapies for the treatment of this disease.

21500269|t|R-flurbiprofen improves axonal transport in the Tg2576 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease as determined by MEMRI.
21500269|a|Axonal pathology is a prevalent feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is thought to occur predominantly due to the accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta). However, it remains unclear whether therapeutics geared toward reducing Abeta improves axonal deficits. We have previously used Manganese Enhanced MRI to demonstrate that axonal transport deficits occur before plaque formation in the Tg2576 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Here we tested whether axonal transport deficits in the Tg2576 mouse model improve in response to the Abeta42 selective lowering agent R-Flurbiprofen (R-F). We demonstrated that in young animals (before Abeta plaque formation), R-F treatment reduced Abeta42 levels and coincided with a significant improvement in axonal transport (P = 0.0186). However, in older animals (after plaque formation had occurred), we observed that R-F treatment did not reduce Abeta42 levels although we still observed a significant improvement in axonal transport as assessed with MEMRI (P = 0.0329). We then determined that R-F treatment reduced tau hyper-phosphorylation in the older animals. These data indicate that both Abeta42 and tau comprise a role in axonal transport rate deficits in the Tg2576 model of Alzheimer's Disease.

21503735|t|Beta-secretase as a target for Alzheimer's disease drug discovery: an overview of in vitro methods for characterization of inhibitors.
21503735|a|beta-Secretase 1 (BACE1) is the enzyme involved in the abnormal production of the amyloidogenic peptide Abeta42, one of the major causes of histological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Thus, BACE1 represents a key target protein in the development of new potential drugs for the non-symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Since the discovery of BACE1 one decade ago, both in the pharmaceutical industry and in academia there has been an intense search for novel inhibitors to be developed as new effective drugs. There is a great deal of interest in the discovery of selective non-peptide BACE1 inhibitors with a new chemical skeleton, suited for central nervous system penetration and endowed with more appropriate pharmacokinetic properties. Therefore, the selection of appropriate methods for screening and characterization of BACE1 inhibitors is crucial. This review focuses on the description of the in vitro methods to test BACE1 activity and inhibition, with particular emphasis on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) methods, aiming at critically highlighting advantages and drawbacks. An overview of BACE1 inhibitors is given, underlying the variability of the FRET methods reported in the literature, and the structure evolution of inhibitors active in cellular cultures and in vivo, from peptide to small synthetic and natural structures.

21504023|t|Effect of the beta-sheet-breaker peptide LPFFD on oriented network of amyloid beta25-35 fibrils.
21504023|a|Amyloid fibrils are self-associating filamentous structures deposited in extracellular tissue in various neurodegenerative and protein misfolding disorders. It has been shown that beta-sheet-breaker (BSB) peptides may interfere with amyloid fibril assembly. Although BSB peptides are prospective therapeutic agents in amyloidosis, there is ambiguity about the mechanisms and generality of their action. In the present work we analyzed the effect of the BSB peptide LPFFD on the growth kinetics, morphologic, and mechanical properties of amyloid beta25-35 (Abeta25-35) fibrils assembled in an oriented array on mica surface. Abeta25-35 is thought to represent the biologically active, toxic fragment of the full-length Abeta peptide. Growth kinetics and morphologic features were analyzed using in situ atomic force microscopy in the presence of various concentrations of LPFFD. We found that the addition of LPFFD only slightly altered the assembly kinetics of Abeta25-35 fibrils. Already formed fibrils did not disassemble in the presence of high concentrations of LPFFD. The mechanical stability of the fibrils was explored with force spectroscopy methods. The nanomechanical behavior of Abeta25-35 fibrils is characterized by the appearance of force staircases which correspond to the force-driven unzipping and dissociation of several protofilaments. In the presence of LPFFD single-plateau force traces dominated. The effects of LPFFD on Abeta25-35 fibril assembly and stability suggest that inter-protofilament interactions were slightly weakened. Complete disassembly of fibrils, however, was not observed. Thus, under the conditions explored here, LPFFD may not be considered as a BSB peptide with generalized beta-sheet breaking properties.

21504025|t|Structure and assembly-disassembly properties of wild-type transthyretin amyloid protofibrils observed with atomic force microscopy.
21504025|a|Transthyretin (TTR) is an important human transport protein present in the serum and the cerebrospinal fluid. Aggregation of TTR in the form of amyloid fibrils is associated with neurodegeneration, but the mechanisms of cytotoxicity are likely to stem from the presence of intermediate assembly states. Characterization of these intermediate species is therefore essential to understand the etiology and pathogenesis of TTR-related amyloidoses. In the present work we used atomic force microscopy to investigate the morphological features of wild-type (WT) TTR amyloid protofibrils that appear in the early stages of aggregation. TTR protofibrils obtained by mild acidification appeared as flexible filaments with variable length and were able to bind amyloid markers (thioflavin T and Congo red). Surface topology and contour-length distribution displayed a periodic pattern of ~ 15 nm, suggesting that the protofibrils assemble via an end-binding oligomer fusion mechanism. The average height and periodic substructure found in protofibrils is compatible with the double-helical model of the TTR amyloid protofilament. Over time protofibrils aggregated into bundles and did not form mature amyloid-like fibrils. Unlike amyloid fibrils that are typically stable under physiological conditions, the bundles dissociated into component protofibrils with axially compacted and radially dilated structure when exposed to phosphate-buffered saline solution. Thus, WT TTR can form metastable filamentous aggregates that may represent an important transient state along the pathway towards the formation of cytotoxic TTR species.

21504739|t|Naproxen interferes with the assembly of Abeta oligomers implicated in Alzheimer's disease.
21504739|a|Experimental and epidemiological studies have shown that the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug naproxen may be useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. To investigate the interactions of naproxen with Abeta dimers, which are the smallest cytotoxic aggregated Abeta peptide species, we use united atom implicit solvent model and exhaustive replica exchange molecular dynamics. We show that naproxen ligands bind to Abeta dimer and penetrate its volume interfering with the interpeptide interactions. As a result naproxen induces a destabilizing effect on Abeta dimer. By comparing the free-energy landscapes of naproxen interactions with Abeta dimers and fibrils, we conclude that this ligand has stronger antiaggregation potential against Abeta fibrils rather than against dimers. The analysis of naproxen binding energetics shows that the location of ligand binding sites in Abeta dimer is dictated by the Abeta amino acid sequence. Comparison of the in silico findings with experimental observations reveals potential limitations of naproxen as an effective therapeutic agent in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

21507938|t|Amyloid-beta annular protofibrils evade fibrillar fate in Alzheimer disease brain.
21507938|a|Annular protofibrils (APFs) represent a new and distinct class of amyloid structures formed by disease-associated proteins. In vitro, these pore-like structures have been implicated in membrane permeabilization and ion homeostasis via pore formation. Still, evidence for their formation and relevance in vivo is lacking. Herein, we report that APFs are in a distinct pathway from fibril formation in vitro and in vivo. In human Alzheimer disease brain samples, amyloid-beta APFs were associated with diffuse plaques, but not compact plaques; moreover, we show the formation of intracellular APFs. Our results together with previous studies suggest that the prevention of amyloid-beta annular protofibril formation could be a relevant target for the prevention of amyloid-beta toxicity in Alzheimer disease.

21510923|t|The hexapeptide PGVTAV suppresses neurotoxicity of human alpha-synuclein aggregates.
21510923|a|In Parkinson's disease patients, alpha-synuclein is the major component of the intracellular protein aggregates found in dopaminergic neurons. Previously, short synthetic alpha-synuclein-derived peptides have been shown to not only prevent alpha-synuclein fibrillation but also dissolve preformed alpha-synuclein aggregates in vitro. The hexapeptide PGVTAV was the shortest peptide that retained the ability to block alpha-synuclein fibrillation. For preventative or therapeutic effectiveness, a treatment must suppress the neurotoxicity of alpha-synuclein aggregates and remain stable in plasma. The present study shows that specific peptides can protect neuronal cells from alpha-synuclein aggregation-induced cell death. The beta-sheet-breaking hexapeptide PGVTAV remained intact in human plasma for longer than one day, suggesting that it may be a candidate for the development of therapeutics to treat Parkinson's disease.

21511472|t|Inhibition and structural reliability of prenylated flavones from the stem bark of Morus lhou on beta-secretase (BACE-1).
21511472|a|The action of beta-secretase is strongly tied to the onset of Alzheimer's disease. The development of inhibitors of beta-secretase is thus critical to combating this disease, which threatens an ever increasing number of the population and grows in importance as the population ages. Herein we show that flavones from Morus lhou potently inhibit beta-secretase. Our aim in this manuscript is to explore the inhibitory kinetics of natural compounds and develop a phamacophore model which details the critical features responsible for inhibitory activity. The IC(50) values of compounds for beta-secretase inhibition were determined to range between 3.4 and 146.1 muM. Prenylated flavone 2 (IC(50)=3.4 muM) was 20 times more effective than its parent compound, noratocarpetin 1 (IC(50)=60.6 muM). The stronger activity was related with resorcinol moiety on B-ring and isoprenyl functionality at C-3. Kinetic analysis shows that the four effective compounds (1-4) have a noncompetitive mode of action. The binding affinity of flavones for beta-secretase calculated using in silico docking experiments correlated well with their IC(50) values and noncompetitive inhibition modes.

21513285|t|Mutations that replace aromatic side chains promote aggregation of the Alzheimer's Abeta peptide.
21513285|a|The aggregation of polypeptides into amyloid fibrils is associated with a number of human diseases. Because these fibrils--or intermediates on the aggregation pathway--play important roles in the etiology of disease, considerable effort has been expended to understand which features of the amino acid sequence promote aggregation. One feature suspected to direct aggregation is the pi-stacking of aromatic residues. Such pi-stacking interactions have also been proposed as the targets for various aromatic compounds that are known to inhibit aggregation. In the case of Alzheimer's disease, the aromatic side chains Phe19 and Phe20 in the wild-type amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide have been implicated. To explicitly test whether the aromaticity of these side chains plays a role in aggregation, we replaced these two phenylalanine side chains with leucines or isoleucines. These residues have similar sizes and hydrophobicities as Phe but are not capable of pi-stacking. Thioflavin-T fluorescence and electron microscopy demonstrate that replacement of residues 19 and 20 by Leu or Ile did not prevent aggregation, but rather enhanced amyloid formation. Further experiments showed that aromatic inhibitors of aggregation are as effective against Ile- and Leu-substituted versions of Abeta42 as they are against wild-type Abeta. These results suggest that aromatic pi-stacking interactions are not critical for Abeta aggregation or for the inhibition of Abeta aggregation.

21513747|t|Soluble Abeta levels correlate with cognitive deficits in the 12-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
21513747|a|Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is believed to be central in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) characterized by cognitive deficits. However, it remains uncertain which form(s) of Abeta pathology is responsible for the cognitive deficits in AD. In the present study, the cognitive deficits and the profiles of Abeta pathology were characterized in the 12-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 double transgenic mice, and their correlations were examined. Compared with non-transgenic littermates, the middle-aged APPswe/PS1dE9 mice exhibited spatial learning and memory deficits in the water maze test and long-term contextual memory deficits in the step-down passive avoidance test. Among the middle-aged APPswe/PS1dE9 mice, hippocampal soluble Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 levels were highly correlated with spatial learning deficits and long-term contextual memory deficits, as well as cortical and hippocampal soluble Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 levels were strongly correlated with spatial memory deficits. By contrast, no significant correlations were observed between three measures of cognitive functions and amyloid plaque burden (total Abeta plaque load and fibrillar Abeta plaque load), total Abeta levels (Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42), as well as insoluble Abeta levels (Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42). Stepwise multiple regression analysis identified hippocampal soluble Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 levels as independent factors for predicting the spatial learning deficits and the long-term contextual memory deficits, as well as hippocampal and cortical soluble Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 levels as independent factors for predicting the spatial memory deficits in transgenic mice. These results demonstrate that cognitive deficits are highly related to the levels of soluble Abeta in middle-aged APPswe/PS1dE9 mice, in which soluble Abeta levels are only a tiny fraction of the amount of total Abeta levels. Consequently, our findings provide further evidence that soluble Abeta might primarily contribute to cognitive deficits in AD, suggesting that reducing the levels of soluble Abeta species would be a therapeutic intervention for AD patients even with large deposits of aggregated, insoluble Abeta.

21514440|t|Tyrosine nitration within the proline-rich region of Tau in Alzheimer's disease.
21514440|a|A substantial body of evidence suggests that nitrative injury contributes to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders. Previously, we showed in vitro that within the tau protein the N-terminal tyrosine residues (Y18 and Y29) are more susceptible to nitrative modifications than other tyrosine sites (Y197 and Y394). Using site-specific antibodies to nitrated tau at Y18 and Y29, we identified tau nitrated in both glial (Y18) and neuronal (Y29) tau pathologies. In this study, we report the characterization of two novel monoclonal antibodies, Tau-nY197 and Tau-nY394, recognizing tau nitrated at Y197 and Y394, respectively. By Western blot analysis, Tau-nY197 labeled soluble tau and insoluble paired helical filament proteins (PHF-tau) nitrated at Y197 from control and AD brain samples. Tau-nY394 failed to label soluble tau isolated from control or severe AD samples, but labeled insoluble PHF-tau to a limited extent. Immunohistochemical analysis using Tau-nY197 revealed the hallmark tau pathology associated with AD; Tau-nY394 did not detect any pathological lesions characteristic of the disorder. These data suggest that a subset of the hallmark pathological inclusions of AD contain tau nitrated at Y197. However, nitration at Y197 was also identified in soluble tau from all control samples, including those at Braak stage 0, suggesting that nitration at this site in the proline-rich region of tau may have normal biological functions in the human brain.

21514441|t|Observations in APP bitransgenic mice suggest that diffuse and compact plaques form via independent processes in Alzheimer's disease.
21514441|a|Studies of familial Alzheimer's disease suggest that misfolding and aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides initiate the pathogenesis. The Arctic mutation of Abeta precursor protein (APP) results in AD, and Arctic Abeta is more prone to form Abeta protofibrils and extracellular deposits. Herein is demonstrated that the burden of diffuse Abeta deposits but not compact plaques is increased when tg-Swe mice are crossed with tg-ArcSwe mice synthesizing low levels of Arctic Abeta. The diffuse deposits in bitransgenic mice, which contain primarily wild-type Abeta42, accumulate in regions both with and without transgene expression. However, APP processing, when compared with tg-Swe, remains unchanged in young bitransgenic mice, whereas wild-type Abeta42 aggregation is accelerated and fibril architecture is altered in vitro and in vivo when a low level of Arctic Abeta42 is introduced. Thus, the increased number of diffuse deposits is likely due to physical interactions between Arctic Abeta and wild-type Abeta42. The selective increase of a single type of parenchymal Abeta deposit suggests that different pathways lead to formation of diffuse and compact plaques. These findings could have general implications for Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and particular relevance to patients heterozygous for the Arctic APP mutation. Moreover, it further illustrates how Abeta neuropathologic features can be manipulated in vivo by mechanisms similar to those originally conceptualized in prion research.

21514693|t|Ovarian hormone loss induces bioenergetic deficits and mitochondrial beta-amyloid.
21514693|a|Previously, we demonstrated that reproductive senescence was associated with mitochondrial deficits comparable to those of female triple-transgenic Alzheimer's mice (3xTgAD). Herein, we investigated the impact of chronic ovarian hormone deprivation and 17beta-estradiol (E2) replacement on mitochondrial function in nontransgenic (nonTg) and 3xTgAD female mouse brain. Depletion of ovarian hormones by ovariectomy (OVX) in nontransgenic mice significantly decreased brain bioenergetics, and induced mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. In 3xTgAD mice, OVX significantly exacerbated mitochondrial dysfunction and induced mitochondrial beta-amyloid and beta-amyloid (Abeta)-binding-alcohol-dehydrogenase (ABAD) expression. Treatment with E2 at OVX prevented OVX-induced mitochondrial deficits, sustained mitochondrial bioenergetic function, decreased oxidative stress, and prevented mitochondrial beta-amyloid and ABAD accumulation. In vitro, E2 increased maximal mitochondrial respiration in neurons and basal and maximal respiration in glia. Collectively, these data demonstrate that ovarian hormone loss induced a mitochondrial phenotype comparable to a transgenic female model of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which was prevented by E2. These findings provide a plausible mechanism for increased risk of Alzheimer's disease in premenopausally oophorectomized women while also suggesting a therapeutic strategy for prevention.

21514924|t|Cognitively preserved subjects with transitional cerebrospinal fluid ss-amyloid 1-42 values have thicker cortex in Alzheimer's disease vulnerable areas.
21514924|a|BACKGROUND: Establishing the relationship between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ss-amyloid 1-42 (Ass) and cortical thickness (CTh) would represent a major step forward in the understanding of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) process. We studied this relationship in a group of healthy control subjects and subjects with subjective memory complaints with preserved cognitive function at neuropsychological testing. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 33 individuals (17 healthy control subjects and 16 subjects with subjective memory complaints) underwent structural 3-Tesla magnetic resonance image scanning and a spinal tap. Cerebrospinal fluid Ass was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The relationship between CSF Ass values and CTh in several regions of interest, both susceptible and unrelated to AD pathology, was analyzed with a curve fit analysis and CTh difference maps were derived from group comparisons. RESULTS: Dichotomizing the whole sample according to Ass values (cutoff 500 pg/mL), we found the expected cortical thinning in Ass positive subjects in temporoparietal areas (p < .05 corrected). When analyzing the relationship between CSF Ass and CTh in AD-susceptible regions, we found a significant inverted U-shaped relationship (quadratic). Therefore, the sample was further divided into tertiles (according to CSF Ass values) to perform subsequent subgroup comparisons. Increased CTh in temporoparietal areas and precuneus (p < .05 corrected) was found in the middle Ass tertile (CSF Ass between 416 and 597 pg/mL) when compared with the high Ass tertile (616-881 pg/mL). CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between Ass and CTh in preclinical stages may not be linear. Cortical thickness in temporoparietal and precuneus regions is greater in subjects with transitional CSF Ass values.

21515354|t|Soybean isoflavone alleviates beta-amyloid 1-42 induced inflammatory response to improve learning and memory ability by down regulation of Toll-like receptor 4 expression and nuclear factor-kappaB activity in rats.
21515354|a|beta-amyloid 1-42 (Abeta1-42)-induced learning and memory impairment in rats is believed to be associated with inflammation. Cytokine production is a key pathologic event in the progression of inflammatory processes. In this rat study, soybean isoflavones (SIF) was used to investigate it's protective effects on inflammation caused by beta-amyloid 1-42 (Abeta1-42), which is associated with learning and memory impairment in Alzheimer disease. We characterized the learning and memory ability. cytokine profiles of circulating interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in the serum and the expression of Toll like receptor4 (TLR4) and nuclear factor-kappaB p65 (NF-kappaB p65) mRNA and protein in the brain tissue following intracerebroventricular administration of Abeta1-42 by miniosmotic pump for 14 days. The results showed that functional deficits of learning and memory in SIF treatment groups were significantly improved compared to the control group without SIF treatment in water maze test. The serum IL-1beta and TNF-alpha level were significantly increased, and the expressions of TLR4 and NF-kappaB p65 mRNA and protein in the brain were up-regulated, indicating inflammation response was initiated following administration of Abeta1-42. After intragastric pre-treatment with SIF, inflammatory cytokines was significantly reduced and also SIF reversed the Abeta1-42 induced up-regulation of TLR4 and NF-kappaB p65 mRNA and protein expression in the brain and expression of NF-kappaB p65 in nuclei. These results suggested that SIF reduced the cytokine cascade and inflammatory response induced by Abeta1-42 which could result in the improvement of spatial learning and memory ability impairment in the rats.

21515373|t|Retromer disruption promotes amyloidogenic APP processing.
21515373|a|Retromer deficiency has been implicated in sporadic AD and animals deficient in retromer components exhibit pronounced neurodegeneration. Because retromer performs retrograde transport from the endosome to the Golgi apparatus and neuronal Abeta is found in late endosomal compartments, we speculated that retromer malfunction might enhance amyloidogenic APP processing by promoting interactions between APP and secretase enzymes in late endosomes. We have evaluated changes in amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and trafficking as a result of disrupted retromer activity by knockdown of Vps35, a vacuolar sorting protein that is an essential component of the retromer complex. Knocking down retromer activity produced no change in the quantity or cellular distribution of total cellular APP and had no affect on internalization of cell-surface APP. Retromer deficiency did, however, increase the ratio of secreted Abeta42:Abeta40 in HEK-293 cells over-expressing APP695, due primarily to a decrease in Abeta40 secretion. Recent studies suggest that the retromer-trafficked protein, Wntless, is secreted at the synapse in exosome vesicles and that these same vesicles contain Abeta. We therefore hypothesized that retromer deficiency may be associated with altered exosomal secretion of APP and/or secretase fragments. Holo-APP, Presenilin and APP C-terminal fragments were detected in exosomal vesicles secreted from HEK-293 cells. Levels of total APP C-terminal fragments were significantly increased in exosomes secreted by retromer deficient cells. These data suggest that reduced retromer activity can mimic the effects of familial AD Presenilin mutations on APP processing and promote export of amyloidogenic APP derivatives.

21519046|t|The potential dual effects of anesthetic isoflurane on hypoxia-induced caspase-3 activation and increases in beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme levels.
21519046|a|BACKGROUND: beta-Amyloid protein (Abeta) accumulation, caspase activation, apoptosis, and hypoxia-induced neurotoxicity have been suggested to be involved in Alzheimer disease neuropathogenesis. Abeta is produced from amyloid precursor protein through proteolytic processing by the aspartyl protease beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme (BACE) and gamma-secretase. Inhaled anesthetics have long been considered to protect against neurotoxicity. However, recent studies have suggested that the inhaled anesthetic isoflurane may promote neurotoxicity by inducing caspase activation and apoptosis, and by increasing levels of BACE and Abeta. We therefore sought to determine whether isoflurane can induce concentration-dependent dual effects on hypoxia-induced caspase-3 activation and increases in BACE levels: protection versus promotion. METHODS: H4 human neuroglioma cells were treated with hypoxia (3% O(2)) alone, different concentrations of isoflurane (0.5% and 2%), and the combination of hypoxia and 0.5% or 2% isoflurane. The levels of caspase-3 cleavage (activation), BACE, and Bcl-2 were determined by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: We show for the first time that treatment with 0.5% isoflurane for 8 hours attenuated, whereas treatment with 2% isoflurane for 8 hours enhanced, hypoxia-induced caspase-3 activation and increases in BACE levels. The 2% isoflurane treatment also enhanced a hypoxia-induced decrease in Bcl-2 levels. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a potential concept that isoflurane has dual effects (protection versus promotion) on hypoxia-induced toxicity, which may act through Bcl-2 family proteins. These findings could lead to more systematic studies to determine the potential dual effects of anesthetics on Alzheimer disease-associated neurotoxicity.

In the present study, Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(25-35), but not Abeta(1-16) and Abeta(35-25), reduce the viability of primary cerebral endothelial cells (CECs) in accordance with apoptosis induction. Increases in caspase 3 and PARP protein cleavage with reductions of the Bcl-2/Bax protein ratio accompanied by a loss in the mitochondria membrane potential were identified in Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(25-35)-treated CECs. A significant decrease in intracellular telomerase activity by Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(25-35) was detected; meanwhile, reduced telomerase activity by telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) siRNA enhanced the cytotoxic effect of Abeta. The addition of serum might block the Abeta(25-35)-induced cytotoxic effect via elevated telomerase activity in according with stimulating phospho-AKT protein expression, which was blocked by adding AKT inhibitor LY294002. Decreases in heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and its client proteins including TERT, AKT, p53, CDK4 were observed in Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(25-35), but not Abeta(1-16) and Abeta(35-25), -treated CECs. The knockdown of HSP90 gene expression by HSP90 siRNA significantly inhibits telomerase activity with decreasing TERT protein expression. The application of HSP90 activity inhibitor geldanamycin (GA) and radicicol (RD) potentiates the telomerase inhibition and apoptosis induction of Abeta in CECs. An increase in protein ubiquitination by Abeta(25-35), but not Abeta(35-25), treatment was examined, and Abeta-inhibited HSP90 and TERT protein expression and telomerase activity was reversed by adding proteasome inhibitor, MG132. Additionally, increased TERT protein ubiquitination by Abeta(25-35) was detected in CECs via immunoprecipitation/Western blotting analysis. The data of the present study firstly demonstrates that telomerase inhibition contributes to the apoptosis induction of Abeta in CECs.

21522131|t|APP and APLP2 are essential at PNS and CNS synapses for transmission, spatial learning and LTP.
21522131|a|Despite its key role in Alzheimer pathogenesis, the physiological function(s) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its proteolytic fragments are still poorly understood. Previously, we generated APPsalpha knock-in (KI) mice expressing solely the secreted ectodomain APPsalpha. Here, we generated double mutants (APPsalpha-DM) by crossing APPsalpha-KI mice onto an APLP2-deficient background and show that APPsalpha rescues the postnatal lethality of the majority of APP/APLP2 double knockout mice. Surviving APPsalpha-DM mice exhibited impaired neuromuscular transmission, with reductions in quantal content, readily releasable pool, and ability to sustain vesicle release that resulted in muscular weakness. We show that these defects may be due to loss of an APP/Mint2/Munc18 complex. Moreover, APPsalpha-DM muscle showed fragmented post-synaptic specializations, suggesting impaired postnatal synaptic maturation and/or maintenance. Despite normal CNS morphology and unaltered basal synaptic transmission, young APPsalpha-DM mice already showed pronounced hippocampal dysfunction, impaired spatial learning and a deficit in LTP that could be rescued by GABA(A) receptor inhibition. Collectively, our data show that APLP2 and APP are synergistically required to mediate neuromuscular transmission, spatial learning and synaptic plasticity.

21523435|t|The mechanism for heme to prevent Abeta(1-40) aggregation and its cytotoxicity.
21523435|a|The beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) aggregation in the brain, known as amyloid plaques, is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aberrant interaction of Cu(2+) ion with Abeta potentiates AD by inducing Abeta aggregation and generating neurotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, the biosynthesized recombinant Abeta(1-40) was, for the first time, used to investigate the mechanism for heme to prevent Abeta(1-40) aggregation and its cytotoxicity. Cell viability studies of SH-SY5Y cells and rat primary hippocampal neurons showed that exogenous heme can protect the cells by reducing cytotoxicity in the presence of Cu(2+) and/or Abeta(1-40). UV-vis spectroscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and differential pulse voltammetry were applied to examine the interaction between heme and Abeta(1-40). It was proven that a heme-Abeta(1-40) complex is formed and can stabilize the alpha-helix structure of Abeta(1-40) to inhibit Abeta(1-40) aggregation. The heme-Abeta(1-40) complex possesses peroxidase activity and it may catalyze the decomposition of H(2)O(2), reduce the generation of ROS downstream, and ultimately protect the cells. These results indicated that exogenous heme is able to alleviate the cytotoxicity induced by Abeta(1-40) and Cu(2+). This information may be a foundation to develop a potential strategy to treat AD.

21524590|t|Protective effect of epsilon-viniferin on beta-amyloid peptide aggregation investigated by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.
21524590|a|Abnormal beta-amyloid peptide accumulation and aggregation is considered to be responsible for the formation and cerebral deposition of senile plaques in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Inhibition of the formation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) fibrils would be an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of AD. Resveratrol and its derivatives exhibit a broad range of pharmacological properties such as protection against cardiovascular diseases and cancers, as well as promoting antiaging effects. We reported previously that epsilon-viniferin glucoside (VG), a resveratrol-derived dimer, strongly inhibits Abeta (25-35) fibril formation in vitro. In this study, we investigated the effects of VG on the aggregation of the full-length peptides (Abeta (1-40) and Abeta (1-42)) and on the beta-amyloid-induced toxicity in PC12 cells. VG inhibited Abeta cytotoxicity and the non-covalent complex between VG and Abeta was observed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.

21527754|t|Amyloid beta enhances migration of endothelial progenitor cells by upregulating CX3CR1 in response to fractalkine, which may be associated with development of choroidal neovascularization.
21527754|a|OBJECTIVE: Deposits that accumulate beneath retinal pigment epithelium, called drusen, are early signs of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). We have shown that amyloid beta (Abeta) is present in drusen, and Abeta may be involved in AMD development. We have also shown that endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) may contribute to the development of choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the role played by CX3CR1, a chemokine receptor, in EPC migration and CNV formation. METHODS AND RESULTS: EPCs collected from human umbilical cords were found to express higher levels of CX3CR1 than human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and exposure of EPCs to Abeta caused further upregulation of CX3CR1. This upregulation was decreased by blocking fractalkine, a ligand of CX3CR1. Exposure of EPCs to fractalkine increased their migration, but pretreatment with Abeta enhanced the migration. The fractalkine-induced EPC migration was more inhibited by EPCs derived from CX3CR1(-/-) mice than wild-type mice. The area of laser-induced CNV was significantly smaller in wild-type mice that received bone marrow transplantation from CX3CR1(-/-) mice than in those that received transplantation from wild-type mice. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that Abeta enhances EPC migration through the upregulation of CX3CR1. This upregulation might play a role in development of CNV.

21530492|t|Protective effect of the phosphodiesterase III inhibitor cilostazol on amyloid beta-induced cognitive deficits associated with decreased amyloid beta accumulation.
21530492|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is characterized by progressive cognitive impairment, is the most common neurodegenerative disease. Here, we investigated the preventive effect of a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, cilostazol against cognitive decline in AD mouse model. In vitro studies using N2a cells stably expressing human amyloid precursor protein Swedish mutation (N2aSwe) showed that cilostazol decreased the amyloid beta (Abeta) levels in the conditioned medium and cell lysates. Cilostazol attenuated the expression of ApoE, which is responsible for Abeta aggregation, in N2aSwe. Intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta(25-35) in C57BL/6J mice resulted in increased immunoreactivity of Abeta and p-Tau, and microglia activation in the brain. Oral administration of cilostazol for 2 weeks before Abeta administration and once a day for 4 weeks post-surgery almost completely prevented the Abeta-induced increases of Abeta and p-Tau immunoreactivity, as well as CD11b immunoreactivity. However, post-treatment with cilostazol 4 weeks after Abeta administration, when Abeta was already accumulated, did not prevent the Abeta-induced neuropathological responses. Furthermore, cilostazol did not affect the neprilysin and insulin degrading enzymes involved in the degradation of the Abeta peptide, but decreased ApoE levels in Abeta-injected brain. In addition, cilostazol significantly improved spatial learning and memory in Abeta-injected mice. The findings suggest that a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, cilostazol significantly decreased Abeta accumulation and improved memory impairment induced by Abeta(25-35). The beneficial effects of cilostazol might be explained by the reduction of Abeta accumulation and tau phosphorylation, not through an increase in Abeta degradation but via a significant decrease in ApoE-mediated Abeta aggregation. Cilostazol may be the basis of a novel strategy for the therapy of AD.

21531045|t|Gadolinium-staining reveals amyloid plaques in the brain of Alzheimer's transgenic mice.
21531045|a|Detection of amyloid plaques in the brain by in vivo neuroimaging is a very promising biomarker approach for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and evaluation of therapeutic efficacy. Here we describe a new method to detect amyloid plaques by in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based on the intracerebroventricular injection of a nontargeted gadolinium (Gd)-based contrast agent, which rapidly diffuses throughout the brain and increases the signal and contrast of magnetic resonance (MR) images by shortening the T1 relaxation time. This gain in image sensitivity after in vitro and in vivo Gd staining significantly improves the detection and resolution of individual amyloid plaques in the cortex and hippocampus of AD transgenic mice. The improved image resolution is sensitive enough to demonstrate an age-dependent increase of amyloid plaque load and a good correlation between the amyloid load measured by muMRI and histology. These results provide the first demonstration that nontargeted Gd staining can enhance the detection of amyloid plaques to follow the progression of AD and to evaluate the activity of amyloid-lowering therapeutic strategies in longitudinal studies.

21533606|t|Cerebral amyloid angiopathy in streptozotocin rat model of sporadic Alzheimer's disease: a long-term follow up study.
21533606|a|Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is manifested as accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide in the wall of meningeal and cerebral arteries, arterioles and capillaries and is frequently found postmortem in sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) patients. It is difficult to assess when and how cerebral amyloid angiopathy develops and progresses in humans in vivo, which is why animal AD models are used. Streptozotocin-intracerebroventricularly (STZ-icv) treated rats have been recently proposed as the model of sAD which develops insulin resistant brain state preceding Abeta pathology development. Vascular Abeta deposits in the brain of STZ-icv-treated rats (3 months old at the time of icv treatment) were visualized by Thioflavine-S staining, Congo red staining and Abeta immunohistochemistry. Thioflavine-S and Congo red staining revealed diffuse congophilic deposits in the wall of meningeal and cortical blood vessels both 6 and 9 months after the STZ-icv treatment. Preliminary Abeta1-42 and Abeta1-16 immunohistochemistry experiments showed positive staining in blood vessels 3 and 9 months after the STZ-icv treatment, respectively. Results suggest that cerebral amyloid angiopathy observed 6 and 9 months after the STZ-icv treatment seems to be a continuation and progression of the amyloid pathology observed already 3 months following the STZ-icv treatment in this non-transgenic sAD animal model.

21533854|t|Pre- and post-synaptic cortical cholinergic deficits are proportional to amyloid plaque presence and density at preclinical stages of Alzheimer's disease.
21533854|a|Amyloid imaging has identified cognitively normal older people with plaques as a group possibly at increased risk for developing Alzheimer's disease-related dementia. It is important to begin to thoroughly characterize this group so that preventative therapies might be tested. Existing cholinotropic agents are a logical choice for preventative therapy as experimental evidence suggests that they are anti-amyloidogenic and clinical trials have shown that they delay progression of mild cognitive impairment to dementia. A detailed understanding of the status of the cortical cholinergic system in preclinical AD is still lacking, however. For more than 30 years, depletion of the cortical cholinergic system has been known to be one of the characteristic features of AD. Reports to date have suggested that some cholinergic markers are altered prior to cognitive impairment while others may show changes only at later stages of dementia. These studies have generally been limited by relatively small sample sizes, long postmortem intervals and insufficient definition of control and AD subjects by the defining histopathology. We, therefore, examined pre- and post-synaptic elements of the cortical cholinergic system in frontal and parietal cortex in 87 deceased subjects, including non-demented elderly with and without amyloid plaques as well as demented persons with neuropathologically confirmed AD. Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity was used as a presynaptic marker while displacement of (3)H-pirenzepine binding by oxotremorine-M in the presence and absence of GppNHp was used to assess postsynaptic M1 receptor coupling. The results indicate that cortical ChAT activity as well as M1 receptor coupling are both significantly decreased in non-demented elderly subjects with amyloid plaques and are more pronounced in subjects with AD and dementia. These findings confirm that cortical cholinergic dysfunction in AD begins at the preclinical stage of disease and suggest that cholinotropic agents currently used for AD treatment are a logical choice for preventative therapy.

21534960|t|Fyn kinase regulates the association between amyloid precursor protein and Dab1 by promoting their localization to detergent-resistant membranes.
21534960|a|The adaptor protein Disabled1 (Dab1) interacts with amyloid precursor protein (APP) and decreases its pathological processing, an effect mediated by Fyn tyrosine kinase. Fyn is highly enriched in lipid rafts, a major site of pathological APP processing. To investigate the role of Fyn in the localization and phosphorylation of APP and Dab1 in lipid rafts, we isolated detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) fractions from wild-type and Fyn knock-out mice. In wild-type mice, all of the Fyn kinase, 17% of total APP, and 33% of total Dab1 were found in DRMs. Nearly all of the tyrosine phosphorylated forms of APP and Dab1 were in DRMs. APP and Dab1 co-precipitated both in and out of DRM fractions, indicating an association that is independent of subcellular localization. Fyn knock-out mice had decreased APP, Dab1, and tyrosine-phosphorylated Dab1 in DRMs but increased co-immunoprecipitation of DRM APP and Dab1. Expression of phosphorylation deficient APP or Dab1 constructs revealed that phosphorylation of APP increases, whereas phosphorylation of Dab1 decreases, the interaction between APP and Dab1. Consistent with these observations, Reelin treatment led to increased Dab1 phosphorylation and decreased association between APP and Dab1. Reelin also caused increased localization of APP and Dab1 to DRMs, an effect that was not seen in Fyn knock-out neurons. These findings suggest that Reelin treatment promotes the localization of APP and Dab1 to DRMs, and affects their phosphorylation by Fyn, thus regulating their interaction.

21535936|t|Dexamethasone potentiated Abeta-induced learning and memory impairment in rats.
21535936|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine whether dexamethasone (DEX) could potentiate amyloid beta-protein (Abeta)-induced learning and memory impairment in rats, and, if so, what the underlying mechanism is. METHODS: Morris water maze was used to investigate whether DEX could potentiate Abeta-induced learning and memory impairment in rats, and the histopathologic changes in CA1 field of hippocampus were examined under a light microscope. Immunohistochemistry was used to observe the change of the phosphorylated tau at Thr-231 in the CA1 field of hippocampus. The effects of DEX on the levels of phospho-tau and p25 induced by Abeta were analyzed by Western blot. RESULTS: The results showed that DEX could potentiate Abeta-induced learning and memory impairment and pathological damage in CA1 field of hippocampus in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats, and could enhance the increased levels of phosphorylated tau induced by Abeta(25-35) in the neuronal cell bodies in CA1 field of hippocampus of SD rats and in the protein extracts from hippocampus. Pretreatment of hippocampal neurons with DEX could up-regulate the increased levels of phosphorylated tau and p25 protein induced by Abeta(25-35) in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that DEX could potentiate Abeta-induced learning and memory impairment and pathological damage in CA1 field of hippocampus in SD rats, which might be related to DEX up-regulating the levels of phosphorylated tau and p25 protein induced by Abeta(25-35). Since Abeta and glucocorticoids increase with aging, DEX potentiating Abeta-induced learning and memory impairment may be one of the etiology of Alzheimer's disease.

21535939|t|3-n-Butylphthalide (NBP) attenuated neuronal autophagy and amyloid-beta expression in diabetic mice subjected to brain ischemia.
21535939|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of dl-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) on brain damage in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice subjected to cerebral ischemia. METHODS: we pretreated diabetic mice with NBP orally for 4 weeks prior and 2 days after transient common carotid artery occlusion (CCAO) operation. Immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy were performed to investigate the neuronal loss, astrocytes activation, amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein expression, and autophagy activation. RESULTS: The results showed that diabetes increased stroke-induced neuronal loss, astrocytes activation, Abeta generation, and autophagy activity, while NBP administration attenuated these changes. Immunofluorescence double staining of Abeta with autophagosome-specific antibody LC3 showed that most elevated Abeta(+) signal was co-localized with LC3(+) signal. CONCLUSION: Our finding suggests that NBP attenuates Abeta generation promoted by diabetes in ischemia might act through inhibiting abnormally activated neuronal autophagy. Therefore, treatment with NBP to modulate autophagy might provide a novel therapeutic strategy for diabetes by preventing ischemic brain damage and depressing the risk of post-stroke dementia.

21538458|t|Applications of mass spectrometry to metabolomics and metabonomics: detection of biomarkers of aging and of age-related diseases.
21538458|a|Every 5 years or so new technologies, or new combinations of old ones, seemingly burst onto the science scene and are then sought after until they reach the point of becoming commonplace. Advances in mass spectrometry instrumentation, coupled with the establishment of standardized chemical fragmentation libraries, increased computing power, novel data-analysis algorithms, new scientific applications, and commercial prospects have made mass spectrometry-based metabolomics the latest sought-after technology. This methodology affords the ability to dynamically catalogue and quantify, in parallel, femtomole quantities of cellular metabolites. The study of aging, and the diseases that accompany it, has accelerated significantly in the last decade. Mutant genes that alter the rate of aging have been found that increase lifespan by up to 10-fold in some model organisms, and substantial progress has been made in understanding fundamental alterations that occur at both the mRNA and protein level in tissues of aging organisms. The application of metabolomics to aging research is still relatively new, but has already added significant insight into the aging process. In this review we summarize these findings. We have targeted our manuscript to two audiences: mass spectrometrists interested in applying their technical knowledge to unanswered questions in the aging field, and gerontologists interested in expanding their knowledge of both mass spectrometry and the most recent advances in aging-related metabolomics.

21538702|t|Attention-related networks in Alzheimer's disease: a resting functional MRI study.
21538702|a|In addition to memory deficits, attentional impairment is a common manifestation of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present study examines the abnormalities of attention-related functional networks in AD using resting functional MRI (fMRI) technique and evaluates the sensitivity and specificity of these networks as potential biomarkers compared with the default mode network (DMN). Group independent component analysis (Group ICA) was applied to fMRI data from 15 AD patients and 16 normal healthy elderly controls (NC) to derive the dorsal attention network (DAN) and the ventral attention network (VAN) which are respectively responsible for the endogenous attention orienting ("top-down") process and the exogenous attention re-orienting ("bottom-up") process. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed for activity in core regions within each of these networks. Functional connectivity analysis revealed disrupted DAN and preserved (less impaired) VAN in AD patients compared with NC, which might indicate impairment of a "top-down" and intact "bottom-up" attentional processing mechanisms in AD. ROC curve analysis suggested that activity in the left intraparietal sulcus and left frontal eye field from DAN as well as the posterior cingulate cortex from the DMN could serve as sensitive and specific biomarkers distinguishing AD from NC.

21539800|t|Amyloid oligomer formation probed by water proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
21539800|a|Formation of amyloid oligomers, the most toxic species of amyloids in degenerative diseases, is critically coupled to the interplay with surrounding water. The hydrophobic force driving the oligomerization causes water removal from interfaces, changing the surface-hydration properties. Here, we show that such effects alter the magnetic relaxation response of local water in ways that may enable oligomer detection. By using water proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we measured significantly longer transverse magnetic relaxation (T(2)) times in mixtures of serum and amyloidogenic Abeta(1-42) peptides versus similar concentration solutions of serum and nonamyloidogenic scrambled Abeta(42-1) peptides. Immunochemistry with oligomer-specific antibodies, electron microscopy and computer simulations demonstrated that the hyperintense magnetic signal correlates with Abeta(1-42) oligomerization. Finding early biophysical markers of the oligomerization process is crucial for guiding the development of new noninvasive imaging techniques, enabling timely diagnosis of amyloid-related diseases and pharmacological intervention.

21543591|t|Soluble Abeta oligomers inhibit long-term potentiation through a mechanism involving excessive activation of extrasynaptic NR2B-containing NMDA receptors.
21543591|a|In Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia severity correlates strongly with decreased synapse density in hippocampus and cortex. Numerous studies report that hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) can be inhibited by soluble oligomers of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta), but the synaptic elements that mediate this effect remain unclear. We examined field EPSPs and whole-cell recordings in wild-type mouse hippocampal slices. Soluble Abeta oligomers from three distinct sources (cultured cells, AD cortex, or synthetic peptide) inhibited LTP, and this was prevented by the selective NR2B inhibitors ifenprodil and Ro 25-6981. Soluble Abeta enhanced NR2B-mediated NMDA currents and extrasynaptic responses; these effects were mimicked by the glutamate reuptake inhibitor dl-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartic acid. Downstream, an Abeta-mediated rise in p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation was followed by downregulation of cAMP response element-binding protein, and LTP impairment was prevented by inhibitors of p38 MAPK or calpain. Thus, soluble Abeta oligomers at low nanomolar levels present in AD brain increase activation of extrasynaptic NR2B-containing receptors, thereby impairing synaptic plasticity.

21543615|t|BACE1 activity is modulated by cell-associated sphingosine-1-phosphate.
21543615|a|Sphingosine kinase (SphK) 1 and 2 phosphorylate sphingosine to generate sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a pluripotent lipophilic mediator implicated in a variety of cellular events. Here we show that the activity of beta-site APP cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1), the rate-limiting enzyme for amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) production, is modulated by S1P in mouse neurons. Treatment by SphK inhibitor, RNA interference knockdown of SphK, or overexpression of S1P degrading enzymes decreased BACE1 activity, which reduced Abeta production. S1P specifically bound to full-length BACE1 and increased its proteolytic activity, suggesting that cellular S1P directly modulates BACE1 activity. Notably, the relative activity of SphK2 was upregulated in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. The unique modulatory effect of cellular S1P on BACE1 activity is a novel potential therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease.

21544098|t|Serum amyloid P component facilitates DNA clearance and inhibits plasmid transfection: implications for human DNA vaccine.
21544098|a|The demonstration that naked plasmid DNA can induce strong immune responses in mice has attracted considerable attention in the vaccine community. However, similar immunizations have been less/not effective in clinical trials during the past decade, and the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we hypothesized that some DNA-binding proteins in human serum may serve as host barriers, responsible for the low efficiency of plasmids' transfection in vivo. Using proteomics, we showed that human serum amyloid P component (hSAP) is specifically present in human DNA-protein complexes. Further analysis indicated that hSAP effectively binds plasmid DNA, inhibits DNA transfection into somatic cells and facilitates the endocytosis of DNA by macrophages, whereas mouse SAP (mSAP) has similar, but much weaker, activities. In the presence of hSAP, the plasmid DNA expression in vivo and plasmid DNA-induced immune responses also significantly decreased. Therefore, our results suggest that hSAP contributes to extracellular DNA clearance and the inhibition of plasmid DNA transfection in vivo. This mechanism may be partly responsible for the insufficient immune responses to DNA vaccination in human beings; therefore, it may serve as a novel target for the improvement of DNA vaccines and DNA-based gene therapy.

21546126|t|An amyloid beta42-dependent deficit in anandamide mobilization is associated with cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.
21546126|a|The endocannabinoids and their attending cannabinoid (CB)(1) receptors have been implicated in the control of cognition, but their possible roles in dementias are still unclear. In the present study, we used liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry to conduct an endocannabinoid-targeted lipidomic analysis of postmortem brain samples from 38 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and 17 control subjects, matched for age and postmortem interval. The analysis revealed that midfrontal and temporal cortex tissue from AD patients contains, relative to control subjects, significantly lower levels of the endocannabinoid anandamide and its precursor 1-stearoyl, 2-docosahexaenoyl-sn-glycero-phosphoethanolamine-N-arachidonoyl (NArPE). No such difference was observed with the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol or 15 additional lipid species. In AD patients, but not in control subjects, statistically detectable positive correlations were found between (1) anandamide content in midfrontal cortex and scores of the Kendrick's Digit Copy test (p = 0.004, r = 0.81; n = 10), which measures speed of information processing; and (2) anandamide content in temporal cortex and scores of the Boston Naming test (p = 0.027, r = 0.52; n = 18), which assesses language facility. Furthermore, anandamide and NArPE levels in midfrontal cortex of the study subjects inversely correlated with levels of the neurotoxic amyloid peptide, amyloid beta-protein (Abeta)(42), while showing no association with Abeta(40) levels, amyloid plaque load or tau protein phosphorylation. Finally, high endogenous levels of Abeta(42) in Swedish mutant form of amyloid precursor protein (APP(SWE))/Neuro-2a cells directly reduced anandamide and NArPE concentrations in cells lysates. The results suggest that an Abeta(42)-dependent impairment in brain anandamide mobilization contributes to cognitive dysfunction in AD.

21548553|t|s-Allyl cysteine, s-ethyl cysteine, and s-propyl cysteine alleviate beta-amyloid, glycative, and oxidative injury in brain of mice treated by D-galactose.
21548553|a|The neuroprotective effects of s-allyl cysteine, s-ethyl cysteine, and s-propyl cysteine in D-galactose (DG)-treated mice were examined. DG treatment increased the formation of Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42), enhanced mRNA expression of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and beta-site APP cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE1), and reduced neprilysin expression in brain (P < 0.05); however, the intake of three test compounds significantly decreased the production of Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) and suppressed the expression of APP and BACE1 (P < 0.05). DG treatments declined brain protein kinase C (PKC) activity and mRNA expression (P < 0.05). Intake of test compounds significantly retained PKC activity, and the expression of PKC-alpha and PKC-gamma (P < 0.05). DG treatments elevated brain activity and mRNA expression of aldose reductase (AR) and sorbitol dehydrogenase as well as increased brain levels of carboxymethyllysine (CML), pentosidine, sorbitol, and fructose (P < 0.05). Test compounds significantly lowered AR activity, AR expression, and CML and pentosidine levels (P < 0.05). DG treatments also significantly increased the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and protein carbonyl and decreased the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (P < 0.05); however, the intake of test compounds in DG-treated mice significantly decreased ROS and protein carbonyl levels and restored brain GPX, SOD, and catalase activities (P < 0.05). These findings support that these compounds via their anti-Abeta, antiglycative, and antioxidative effects were potent agents against the progression of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

21550980|t|Characterization of prefibrillar Tau oligomers in vitro and in Alzheimer disease.
21550980|a|Neurofibrillary tangles, composed of insoluble aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein Tau, are a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD) and other tauopathies. However, recent evidence indicates that neuronal dysfunction precedes the formation of these insoluble fibrillar deposits, suggesting that earlier prefibrillar Tau aggregates may be neurotoxic. To determine the composition of these aggregates, we have employed a photochemical cross-linking technique to examine intermolecular interactions of full-length Tau in vitro. Using this method, we demonstrate that dimerization is an early event in the Tau aggregation process and that these dimers self-associate to form larger oligomeric aggregates. Moreover, using these stabilized Tau aggregates as immunogens, we generated a monoclonal antibody that selectively recognizes Tau dimers and higher order oligomeric aggregates but shows little reactivity to Tau filaments in vitro. Immunostaining indicates that these dimers/oligomers are markedly elevated in AD, appearing in early pathological inclusions such as neuropil threads and pretangle neurons as well as colocalizing with other early markers of Tau pathogenesis. Taken as a whole, the work presented herein demonstrates the existence of alternative Tau aggregates that precede formation of fibrillar Tau pathologies and raises the possibility that these hierarchical oligomeric forms of Tau may contribute to neurodegeneration.

21553928|t|Single-molecule atomic force microscopy force spectroscopy study of Abeta-40 interactions.
21553928|a|Misfolding and aggregation of amyloid beta-40 (Abeta-40) peptide play key roles in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying these molecular processes. We developed a novel experimental approach that can directly probe aggregation-prone states of proteins and their interactions. In this approach, the proteins are anchored to the surface of the atomic force microscopy substrate (mica) and the probe, and the interaction between anchored molecules is measured in the approach-retraction cycles. We used dynamic force spectroscopy (DFS) to measure the stability of transiently formed dimers. One of the major findings from DFS analysis of alpha-synuclein (alpha-Syn) is that dimeric complexes formed by misfolded alpha-Syn protein are very stable and dissociate over a range of seconds. This differs markedly from the dynamics of monomers, which occurs on a microsecond to nanosecond time scale. Here we applied the same approach to quantitatively characterize interactions of Abeta-40 peptides over a broad range of pH values. These studies showed that misfolded dimers are characterized by lifetimes in the range of seconds. This value depends on pH and varies between 2.7 s for pH 2.7 and 0.1 s for pH 7, indicating that the aggregation properties of Abeta-40 are modulated by the environmental conditions. The analysis of the contour lengths revealed the existence of various pathways for dimer dissociation, suggesting that dimers with different conformations are formed. These structural variations result in different aggregation pathways, leading to different types of oligomers and higher-order aggregates, including fibrils.

21555336|t|Assessment of mild dementia with amyloid and dopamine terminal positron emission tomography.
21555336|a|We assessed the relationship between consensus clinical diagnostic classification and neurochemical positron emission tomography imaging of striatal vesicular monoamine transporters and cerebrocortical deposition of abeta-amyloid in mild dementia. Seventy-five subjects with mild dementia (Mini-Mental State Examination score>=18) underwent a conventional clinical evaluation followed by 11C-dihydrotetrabenazine positron emission tomography imaging of striatal vesicular monoamine transporters and 11C-Pittsburgh compound-B positron emission tomography imaging of cerebrocortical abeta-amyloid deposition. Clinical classifications were assigned by consensus of an experienced clinician panel. Neuroimaging classifications were assigned as Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia or dementia with Lewy bodies on the basis of the combined 11C-dihydrotetrabenazine and 11C-Pittsburgh compound-B results. Thirty-six subjects were classified clinically as having Alzheimer's disease, 25 as having frontotemporal dementia and 14 as having dementia with Lewy bodies. Forty-seven subjects were classified by positron emission tomography neuroimaging as having Alzheimer's disease, 15 as having dementia with Lewy bodies and 13 as having frontotemporal dementia. There was only moderate agreement between clinical consensus and neuroimaging classifications across all dementia subtypes, with discordant classifications in ~35% of subjects (Cohen's kappa=0.39). Discordant classifications were least frequent in clinical consensus Alzheimer's disease (17%), followed by dementia with Lewy bodies (29%) and were most common in frontotemporal dementia (64%). Accurate clinical classification of mild neurodegenerative dementia is challenging. Though additional post-mortem correlations are required, positron emission tomography imaging likely distinguishes subgroups corresponding to neurochemically defined pathologies. Use of these positron emission tomography imaging methods may augment clinical classifications and allow selection of more uniform subject groups in disease-modifying therapeutic trials and other prospective research involving subjects in the early stages of dementia.

21555603|t|Comparison of analytical platforms for cerebrospinal fluid measures of beta-amyloid 1-42, total tau, and p-tau181 for identifying Alzheimer disease amyloid plaque pathology.
21555603|a|BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of Alzheimer disease (AD) are currently being considered for inclusion in revised diagnostic criteria for research and/or clinical purposes to increase the certainty of antemortem diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: To test whether CSF biomarker assays differ in their ability to identify true markers of underlying AD pathology (eg, amyloid plaques and/or neurofibrillary tangles) in living individuals. DESIGN: We compared the performances of the 2 most commonly used platforms, INNOTEST enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and INNO-BIA AlzBio3, for measurement of CSF beta-amyloid (Abeta) and tau proteins to identify the presence of amyloid plaques in a research cohort (n=103). Values obtained for CSF Abeta1-42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau(181)) using the 2 assay platforms were compared with brain amyloid load as assessed by positron emission tomography using the amyloid imaging agent Pittsburgh compound B. SETTING: The Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at Washington University in St Louis, Missouri. SUBJECTS: Research volunteers who were cognitively normal or had mild to moderate AD dementia. RESULTS: The 2 assay platforms yielded different (approximately 2- to 6-fold) absolute values for the various analytes, but relative values were highly correlated. The CSF Abeta1-42 correlated inversely and tau and p-tau(181) correlated positively with the amount of cortical Pittsburgh compound B binding, albeit to differing degrees. Both assays yielded similar patterns of CSF biomarker correlations with amyloid load. The ratios of total tau to Abeta1-42 and p-tau(181) to Abeta1-42 outperformed any single analyte, including Abeta1-42, in discriminating individuals with vs without cortical amyloid. CONCLUSIONS: The INNOTEST and INNO-BIA CSF platforms perform equally well in identifying individuals with underlying amyloid plaque pathology. Differences in absolute values, however, point to the need for assay-specific diagnostic cutoff values.

21555785|t|Mechanism of amylin fibrillization enhancement by heparin.
21555785|a|We characterized the interaction of amylin with heparin fragments of defined length, which model the glycosaminoglycan chains associated with amyloid deposits found in type 2 diabetes. Binding of heparin fragments to the positively charged N-terminal half of monomeric amylin depends on the concentration of negatively charged saccharides but is independent of oligosaccharide length. By contrast, amylin fibrillogenesis has a sigmoidal dependence on heparin fragment length, with an enhancement observed for oligosaccharides longer than four monomers and a leveling off of effects beyond 12 monomers. The length dependence suggests that the negatively charged helical structure of heparin electrostatically complements the positively charged surface of the fibrillar amylin cross-beta structure. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy experiments indicate that heparin associates with amylin fibrils, rather than enhancing fibrillogenesis catalytically. Short heparin fragments containing two- or eight-saccharide monomers protect against amylin cytotoxicity toward a MIN6 mouse cell model of pancreatic beta-cells.

21557317|t|Computer simulation study of amyloid fibril formation by palindromic sequences in prion peptides.
21557317|a|We simulate the aggregation of large systems containing palindromic peptides from the Syrian hamster prion protein SHaPrP 113-120 (AGAAAAGA) and the mouse prion protein MoPrP 111-120 (VAGAAAAGAV) and eight sequence variations: GAAAAAAG, (AG)(4) , A8, GAAAGAAA, A10, V10, GAVAAAAVAG, and VAVAAAAVAV The first two peptides are thought to act as the Velcro that holds the parent prion proteins together in amyloid structures and can form fibrils themselves. Kinetic events along the fibrillization pathway influence the types of structures that occur and variations in the sequence affect aggregation kinetics and fibrillar structure. Discontinuous molecular dynamics simulations using the PRIME20 force field are performed on systems containing 48 peptides starting from a random coil configuration. Depending on the sequence, fibrillar structures form spontaneously over a range of temperatures, below which amorphous aggregates form and above which no aggregation occurs. AGAAAAGA forms well organized fibrillar structures whereas VAGAAAAGAV forms less well organized structures that are partially fibrillar and partially amorphous. The degree of order in the fibrillar structure stems in part from the types of kinetic events leading up to its formation, with AGAAAAGA forming less amorphous structures early in the simulation than VAGAAAAGAV. The ability to form fibrils increases as the chain length and the length of the stretch of hydrophobic residues increase. However as the hydrophobicity of the sequence increases, the ability to form well-ordered structures decreases. Thus, longer hydrophobic sequences form slightly disordered aggregates that are partially fibrillar and partially amorphous. Subtle changes in sequence result in slightly different fibril structures.

21557621|t|Seed-dependent deposition behavior of Abeta peptides studied with wireless quartz-crystal-microbalance biosensor.
21557621|a|Real-time monitoring of the deposition processes of Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 peptides on various seeds has been performed using a 55 MHz wireless quartz-crystal microbalance (QCM) over long-time periods (~40 h). Dissolved peptide solutions were stirred for nucleation and growth of seeds at pH = 7.4 and 4.6, which were immobilized on the sensor chips. The isolated Abeta peptides were then flowed at the neutral pH, focusing on the interaction between the seeds and the monomers (or small multimers), excluding other interactions among seeds and other aggregates. The thioflavin-T fluorescence assay and atomic-force microscopy were used for evaluating structures of the seeds and deposited aggregates. The deposition rate, determined by the frequency decrease, is about 100 monomers/nm(2)/year in the case of fibril formation. The notable deposition behavior was observed in the deposition of Abeta1-40 peptide on Abeta1-42 seeds grown at the lower pH, which can be an important model for Alzheimer's disease.

21558319|t|Glucocorticoids facilitate astrocytic amyloid-beta peptide deposition by increasing the expression of APP and BACE1 and decreasing the expression of amyloid-beta-degrading proteases.
21558319|a|In most cases, the molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) is unknown. Elevated basal cortisol levels in AD patients suggest that glucocorticoids (GC) may contribute to the development and/or maintenance of AD. Amyloid plaques are the hallmark of AD, and they are considered to play an early role in the AD process. However, little is known about how their formation is regulated by stress and GC. Astrocyte accumulation is one of the earliest neuropathological changes in AD. Here, we report that GC elevated amyloid-beta (Abeta) production in primary cultures of astrocytes by increasing amyloid precursor protein (APP) and beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 gene expression. Notably, GC administered to normal, middle-aged mice promoted the expression of APP and beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 in astrocytes, as determined by double immunofluorescence. Additionally, confocal microscopy and ELISA revealed that GC markedly reduced Abeta degradation and clearance by astrocytes in vitro, indicating a decreased neuroprotective capacity of the astrocytes. This may have been due to the decrease of several Abeta-degrading proteases, such as insulin-degrading enzyme and matrix metalloproteinase-9. These effects occurred through the activation of GC receptors. Taken together, our results demonstrate that GC can enhance the production of Abeta, reduce its degradation in astrocytes, and provide a molecular mechanism linking stress factors to AD. Our study suggests that GC can facilitate AD pathogenesis and that reducing GC in the elderly and early AD patients would be beneficial.

21558417|t|Regulation of Notch1 signaling by the APP intracellular domain facilitates degradation of the Notch1 intracellular domain and RBP-Jk.
21558417|a|The Notch1 receptor is a crucial controller of cell fate decisions, and is also a key regulator of cell growth and differentiation in a variety of contexts. In this study, we have demonstrated that the APP intracellular domain (AICD) attenuates Notch1 signaling by accelerated degradation of the Notch1 intracellular domain (Notch1-IC) and RBP-Jk, through different degradation pathways. AICD suppresses Notch1 transcriptional activity by the dissociation of the Notch1-IC-RBP-Jk complex after processing by gamma-secretase. Notch1-IC is capable of forming a trimeric complex with Fbw7 and AICD, and AICD enhances the protein degradation of Notch1-IC through an Fbw7-dependent proteasomal pathway. AICD downregulates the levels of RBP-Jk protein through the lysosomal pathway. AICD-mediated degradation is involved in the preferential degradation of non-phosphorylated RBP-Jk. Collectively, our results demonstrate that AICD functions as a negative regulator in Notch1 signaling through the promotion of Notch1-IC and RBP-Jk protein degradation.

21562247|t|Expanded ATXN2 CAG repeat size in ALS identifies genetic overlap between ALS and SCA2.
21562247|a|OBJECTIVES: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder of motor neurons that results in progressive muscle weakness and limits survival to 2-5 years after disease onset. Intermediate CAG repeat expansions in ataxin 2 (ATXN2), the causative gene of spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), have been implicated in sporadic ALS. We studied ATXN2 in a large cohort of patients with sporadic and familial ALS. METHODS: We determined ATXN2 CAG repeat size in 1,948 sporadic and familial ALS cases and 2,002 controls from Belgium and the Netherlands. RESULTS: In controls, the maximal ATXN2 repeat size was 31. In sporadic ALS, a significant amount of longer repeat sizes (>= 32, range 32-39) were encountered (in 0.5% or 10/1,845 ALS cases, vs 0% in controls, p = 0.0006). Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that a cutoff of >= 29 appeared optimal to discriminate ALS from control (p = 0.036, odds ratio [OR] 1.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-3.64). A meta-analysis with the previously published results from the United States showed that the association between a repeat length of >= 29 and ALS became stronger (p < 0.0001, OR 2.93, 95% CI 1.73-4.98). In unexplained familial ALS, we found an intermediate repeat expansion of 31 and a homozygous repeat expansion of 33 each in 1.1% of families. The phenotype of patients with ALS with expanded repeat sizes ranged from rapidly progressive typical ALS to slowly progressive ALS with reduced sensory nerve action potentials. CONCLUSION: Our data reveal a novel genetic overlap between ALS and SCA2.

21562267|t|Critical role of astroglial apolipoprotein E and liver X receptor-alpha expression for microglial Abeta phagocytosis.
21562267|a|Liver X receptors (LXRs) regulate immune cell function and cholesterol metabolism, both factors that are critically involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD). To investigate the therapeutic potential of long-term LXR activation in amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide deposition in an AD model, 13-month-old, amyloid plaque-bearing APP23 mice were treated with the LXR agonist TO901317. Postmortem analysis demonstrated that TO901317 efficiently crossed the blood-brain barrier. Insoluble and soluble Abeta levels in the treated APP23 mice were reduced by 80% and 40%, respectively, compared with untreated animals. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, however, was hardly changed by the compound, suggesting that the observed effects were instead mediated by Abeta disposal. Despite the profound effect on Abeta levels, spatial learning in the Morris water maze was only slightly improved by the treatment. ABCA1 (ATP-binding cassette transporter 1) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) protein levels were increased and found to be primarily localized in astrocytes. Experiments using primary microglia demonstrated that medium derived from primary astrocytes exposed to TO901317 stimulated phagocytosis of fibrillar Abeta. Conditioned medium from TO901317-treated ApoE(-/-) or LXRalpha(-/-) astrocytes did not increase phagocytosis of Abeta. In APP23 mice, long-term treatment with TO901317 strongly increased the association of microglia and Abeta plaques. Short-term treatment of APP/PS1 mice with TO901317 also increased this association, which was dependent on the presence of LXRalpha and was accompanied by increased ApoE lipidation. Together, these data suggest that astrocytic LXRalpha activation and subsequent release of ApoE by astrocytes is critical for the ability of microglia to remove fibrillar Abeta in response to treatment with TO901317.

21562856|t|YAP accelerates Abeta(25-35)-induced apoptosis through upregulation of Bax expression by interaction with p73.
21562856|a|Accumulation of amyloid-beta-peptide (Abeta) in the brain is considered as a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous studies show that p73 is vital for mediating the pathogenic process of AD. Yes-associated protein (YAP) has been shown to positively regulate p73 in promoting apoptosis induced by anti-cancer agents. However, the functional role of YAP and potential relationship between YAP and p73 in AD are unknown. In the present study, we found that YAP accelerated apoptosis in response to Abeta(25-35) and the nuclear translocation of YAP was involved in cellular signals that regulated the apoptosis. Abeta(25-35) induced YAP translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus accompanied with the increased phosphorylation on Y357, resulting in the enhancement of interaction between YAP and p73. Moreover, inhibition of YAP expression by small hairpin RNA (shRNA) suppressed apoptosis induced by Abeta(25-35). More importantly, p73-mediated induction of Bax expression and activation were in a YAP-dependent manner. Overexpression of YAP accelerated Bax translocation, upregulated Bax expression and promoted caspase-3 activation. Taken together, our findings first demonstrated that YAP accelerated Abeta-induced apoptosis through nucleus translocation, leading to the induction of Bax expression and activation. Our results provided a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AD through inhibiting YAP/p73/Bax pathway.

21565831|t|A standardized and biocompatible preparation of aggregate-free amyloid beta peptide for biophysical and biological studies of Alzheimer's disease.
21565831|a|We provide a validated and rapid protocol for the solubilization of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta). This procedure involves sequential solubilization using structure-breaking organic solvents hexafluoroisopropanol and DMSO followed by column purification. The low solubility and tendency of Abeta to aggregate considerably impede the in vitro handling and biophysical or biological investigation of Abeta, despite the interest in this peptide because of its implication in Alzheimer's disease. The main advantage of the proposed protocol over others is that it results in standardized aggregate-free Abeta peptide samples that are biocompatible for cell culture studies and yield reproducible aggregation kinetics and cytotoxicities. This three-step protocol also enables the co-solubilization of the longer Abeta42 variant with Abeta40 in ratios relevant to Alzheimer's disease.

21567509|a|The ability of an aqueous extract of W. somnifera L. Dunal (Family: Solanaceae) roots to inhibit fibril formation by the amyloid-beta peptide in vitro was investigated. W. somnifera is used extensively in traditional Ayurvedic medicine as a nerve tonic with reputed memory enhancing properties. Inhibition of fibrillogenesis measured by transmission electron microscopy and ThT fluorescence assay showed that an aqueous extract of W. somnifera strongly inhibited Abeta fibril formation in a concentration-dependent manner, when compared with control samples. These results suggest that the aqueous extract of W. somnifera root has an ability to inhibit the formation of mature amyloid-beta fibrils in vitro, which are known to lead to amyloid plaque formation in vivo.

21570408|t|Expansion of type II CAAX proteases reveals evolutionary origin of gamma-secretase subunit APH-1.
21570408|a|Intramembrane proteases are responsible for a number of regulated proteolysis events occurring within or near the plasma and intracellular membranes. Members of one large and diverse family of putative intramembrane metalloproteases are widely distributed in all domains of life, including the type II CAAX prenyl proteases and their prokaryotic homologs with putative bacteriocin-related functions. We used sensitive sequence similarity searches to expand this large CPBP (CAAX proteases and bacteriocin-processing enzymes) family to include more than 5800 members and infer its homologous relationships to several other protein families, including the PrsW proteases, the DUF2324 (DUF, domain of unknown function) family and the gamma-secretase subunit APH-1 proteins. They share four predicted core transmembrane segments and possess similar yet distinct sets of sequence motifs. Remote similarity between APH-1 and membrane proteases sheds light on APH-1's evolutionary origin and raises the possibility that APH-1 may possess proteolytic activity in the current or ancestral form of gamma-secretase.

21575606|t|Phosphate and HEPES buffers potently affect the fibrillation and oligomerization mechanism of Alzheimer's Abeta peptide.
21575606|a|The oligomerization of Abeta peptide into amyloid fibrils is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Due to its biological relevance, phosphate is the most commonly used buffer system for studying the formation of Abeta and other amyloid fibrils. Investigation into the characteristics and formation of amyloid fibrils frequently relies upon material formed in vitro, predominantly in phosphate buffers. Herein, we examine the effects on the fibrillation and oligomerization mechanism of Abeta peptide that occur due solely to the influence of phosphate buffer. We reveal that significant differences in amyloid fibrillation are observed due to fibrillation being initiated in phosphate or HEPES buffer (at physiological pH and temperature). Except for the differing buffer ions, all experimental parameters were kept constant. Fibril formation was assessed using fluorescently monitored kinetic studies, microscopy, X-ray fiber diffraction and infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies. Based on this set up, we herein reveal profound effects on the mechanism and speed of Abeta fibrillation. The three histidine residues at positions 6, 13 and 14 of Abeta(1-40) are instrumental in these mechanistic changes. We conclude that buffer plays a more significant role in fibril formation than has been generally acknowledged.

21575663|t|Design and evaluation of a 6-mer amyloid-beta protein derived phage display library for molecular targeting of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease: Comparison with two cyclic heptapeptides derived from a randomized phage display library.
21575663|a|Amyloid plaques are the main molecular hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Specific carriers are needed for molecular imaging and for specific drug delivery. In order to identify new low molecular weight amyloid plaque-specific ligands, the phage display technology was used to design short peptides that bind specifically to amyloid-beta protein, which is the principal component of amyloid plaques. For this purpose, a phage display library was designed from the amino acid sequence of amyloid-beta 1-42. Then, the diversity was increased by soft oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. This library was screened against amyloid-beta 1-42 and several phage clones were isolated. Their genomes were sequenced to identify the displayed peptides and their dissociation constants for amyloid-beta 1-42 binding were evaluated by ELISA. The two best peptides, which are derived from the C-terminus hydrophobic domain of amyloid-beta 1-42 that forms a beta-strand in amyloid fibers, were synthesized and biotinylated. After confirming their binding affinity for amyloid-beta 1-42 by ELISA, the specific interaction with amyloid plaques was validated by immunohistochemistry on brain sections harvested from a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. The thioflavin T aggregation assay has furthermore shown that our peptides are able to inhibit the amyloid fiber formation. They are not toxic for neurons, and some of them are able to cross the blood-brain barrier after grafting to a magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent. To conclude, these peptides have high potential for molecular targeting of amyloid plaques, either as carriers of molecular imaging and therapeutic compounds or as amyloid fiber disrupting agents.

21584286|t|Altered oxidative stress levels in Indian Parkinson's disease patients with PARK2 mutations.
21584286|a|The aim of this pilot study was to determine the baseline state of oxidative stress indices in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Peripheral blood samples of 15 PD subjects were analyzed and compared with ten age matched healthy controls. Patients with PARK2 mutations were also compared with PD patients without mutations. There was significant increase in malondialdehyde content and superoxide-dismutase (SOD) activity in peripheral blood parameters in PD patients (p < 0.05) in comparison to controls. These findings suggest an important role of oxidative stress in Parkinson's disease evolution and progress. No changes were observed in glutathione peroxidase and nitric oxide levels. We found significant correlation between SOD activity and lipid peroxidation when the biochemical data was further analyzed. In addition, significant increase in the levels of SOD among the PD patients with PARK2 mutations was observed, which can be ascribed to chronic oxidative stress induced by PARK2 mutations.

21585286|t|Cathepsins S, B and L with aminopeptidases display beta-secretase activity associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
21585286|a|beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE1) cleaves the wild type (WT) beta-site very slowly (k(cat)/K(m): 46.6 m(-1) s(-1)). Therefore we searched for additional beta-secretases and identified three cathepsins that split the WT beta-site much faster. Human cathepsin S cleaves the WT beta-site (k(cat)/K(m): 54 700 m(-1) s(-1)) 1170-fold faster than BACE1 and cathepsins B and L are 440- and 74-fold faster than BACE1, respectively. These cathepsins split two bonds flanking the WT beta-site (K-MD-A), where the K-M bond (85%) is cleaved more efficiently than the D-A bond (15%). Cleavage at the major K-M bond yields Abeta (amyloid beta-peptide) extended by N-terminal Met that should be removed to generate Abeta initiated by Asp1. The activity of cytosol and microsomal aminopeptidases on relevant peptides revealed rapid removal of N-terminal Met but not N-terminal Asp. Brain aminopeptidases showed similar specificity. Thus, aminopeptidases would convert Abeta extended by Met into regular Abeta (Asp1) found in amyloid plaques. Earlier studies indicate that Abeta is likely produced in the endosome and lysosome system where cathepsins S, B and L are localized and cysteine cathepsin inhibitors reduce the level of Abeta in cells and animals. Taken together, cathepsins S, B and L deserve further evaluation as therapeutic targets to develop disease modifying drugs to treat Alzheimer's disease.

21585370|t|Amyloid-beta peptide(1-40) elimination from cerebrospinal fluid involves low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 at the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier.
21585370|a|Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) concentration in CSF is potentially a diagnostic and therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The purpose of this study was to clarify the elimination mechanism of human Abeta(1-40) [hAbeta (1-40)] from CSF. After intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration, [(125) I]hAbeta(1-40) was eliminated from the rat CSF with a half-life of 17.3 min. The elimination of [(125) I]hAbeta(1-40) was significantly inhibited by human receptor-associated protein (RAP) and the elimination was attenuated in either anti-low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP)1 antibody-treated or RAP-deficient mice, suggesting that a member(s) of the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene family is involved in the elimination of hAbeta(1-40) from CSF. The amounts of LRP1 and LRP2 proteins were determined by means of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and the LRP1 content in rat choroid plexus was determined to be 3.7 fmol/mug protein, whereas the LRP2 content was below the detection limit (<0.2 fmol/mug protein). Conditionally, immortalized rat choroid plexus epithelial cells exhibited predominant apical-to-basal and apical-to-cell transport of [(125) I]hAbeta(1-40). These results indicated that hAbeta(1-40) is actively eliminated from CSF and this process is at least partly mediated by LRP1 expressed at choroid plexus epithelial cells, which therefore play a role in determining CSF concentrations of hAbeta(1-40).

21587206|t|APP heterozygosity averts memory deficit in knockin mice expressing the Danish dementia BRI2 mutant.
21587206|a|An autosomal dominant mutation in the BRI2/ITM2B gene causes familial Danish dementia (FDD). Analysis of FDD(KI) mice, a mouse model of FDD genetically congruous to the human disease since they carry one mutant and one wild-type Bri2/Itm2b allele, has shown that the Danish mutation causes loss of Bri2 protein, synaptic plasticity and memory impairments. BRI2 is a physiological interactor of Abeta-precursor protein (APP), a gene associated with Alzheimer disease, which inhibits processing of APP. Here, we show that APP/Bri2 complexes are reduced in synaptic membranes of FDD(KI) mice. Consequently, APP metabolites derived from processing of APP by beta-, alpha- and gamma-secretases are increased in Danish dementia mice. APP haplodeficiency prevents memory and synaptic dysfunctions, consistent with a role for APP metabolites in the pathogenesis of memory and synaptic deficits. This genetic suppression provides compelling evidence that APP and BRI2 functionally interact, and that the neurological effects of the Danish form of BRI2 only occur when sufficient levels of APP are supplied by two alleles. This evidence establishes a pathogenic sameness between familial Danish and Alzheimer's dementias.

21593432|t|Neuropeptide pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) slows down Alzheimer's disease-like pathology in amyloid precursor protein-transgenic mice.
21593432|a|Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) has neuroprotective and neurotrophic properties and is a potent alpha-secretase activator. As PACAP peptides and their specific receptor PAC1 are localized in central nervous system areas affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD), this study aims to examine the role of the natural peptide PACAP as a valuable approach in AD therapy. We investigated the effect of PACAP in the brain of an AD transgenic mouse model. The long-term intranasal daily PACAP application stimulated the nonamyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and increased expression of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor and of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein. In addition, it caused a strong reduction of the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) transporter receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) mRNA level. PACAP, by activation of the somatostatin-neprilysin cascade, also enhanced expression of the Abeta-degrading enzyme neprilysin in the mouse brain. Furthermore, daily PAC1-receptor activation via PACAP resulted in an increased mRNA level of both the PAC1 receptor and its ligand PACAP. Our behavioral studies showed that long-term PACAP treatment of APP[V717I]-transgenic mice improved cognitive function in animals. Thus, nasal application of PACAP was effective, and our results indicate that PACAP could be of therapeutic value in treating AD.

21593437|t|Identification of pure subcortical vascular dementia using 11C-Pittsburgh compound B.
21593437|a|BACKGROUND: Subcortical vascular dementia (SVaD) is considered the most common type of vascular dementia and often follows a slowly progressive course, simulating Alzheimer disease (AD). Whether the progressive cognitive decline is associated with pure SVaD or concomitant AD remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine what proportion of patients with SVaD lack abnormal amyloid imaging, and to examine differences in the clinical or MRI features between subjects with SVaD with cortical amyloid deposition and those without. METHODS: We measured brain amyloid deposition using (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET in 45 patients (men: women = 19:26; mean age 74.2 +- 7.6 years) with SVaD. They all met DSM-IV criteria for vascular dementia and had severe white matter high signal intensities without territorial infarction or macrohemorrhage on MRI. RESULTS: Thirty-one (68.9%) of 45 patients with SVaD were negative for cortical PiB binding. There was significant difference between (11)C-PiB-positive and (11)C-PiB-negative groups in terms of age (79.5 vs 71.9 years), Mini-Mental State Examination score (18.6 vs 22.6), the number of lacunes (3.9 vs 9.0), and the visual rating scale of hippocampal atrophy (3.1 vs 2.3). The neuropsychological assessments revealed that patients with (11)C-PiB-negative SVaD performed better on the delayed recall of both the verbal and visual memory test than did those with (11)C-PiB-positive scan. CONCLUSION: SVaD without abnormal amyloid imaging was more common than expected. Patients with SVaD with and without abnormal amyloid imaging differed in clinical and MRI features, although there was considerable overlap.

21593564|t|Effect of environmental enrichment on the immunoendocrine aging of male and female triple-transgenic 3xTg-AD mice for Alzheimer's disease.
21593564|a|We have previously shown that 3xTgAD mice (triple-transgenic mice for Alzheimer's disease, harboring PS1(M146V), AbetaPP(Swe), tau(P301L) transgenes) suffer detrimental changes in some key lymphocyte functions, described as health and longevity markers, with males being more affected than females and showing higher mortality rates. In the present work, 3xTgAD and wild type 129/C57BL6 male and female non- and environmentally enriched mice were used. The enriched environment (EE) began in the adulthood (6 months) and lasted for 5.5 months. The animals were sacrificed at advanced stages of the disease (15 month-old), and spleen, thymus, and plasma were obtained. The results indicate that 3xTg-AD males are especially benefitted from EE exposure, as shown by the improvement in lymphocyte functional activities such as chemotaxis and natural killer cytotoxicity, as well as in plasma corticosterone levels. By contrast, wild type females seem to be highly sensitive to EE removal, as regards the proliferation capacity of lymphocytes and their intracellular glutathione content. These results support the relevance of gender differences in AD when screening for new strategies for the control of the disease, and suggest that active life, by means of EE, should be maintained until natural death in order to preserve all the positive effects that this strategy exerts on the immune system.

21593565|t|The role of CNI-1493 in the function of primary microglia with respect to amyloid-beta.
21593565|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomer toxicity is a crucial factor in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, the aim of therapeutic research is to target the modification of secretase activity, increase Abeta degradation, reduce Abeta formation, and modulate Abeta-induced neuroinflammation. Recently, the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor CNI-1493 has been shown to reduce plaque load and has led to an improvement in memory performance in a transgenic mouse model. We examined the role of CNI-1493 in the microglial inflammatory response to Abeta using both a microglia cell line as well as primary microglia isolated from mesocortices. MTT assays were performed to quantify cell viability. FACS analysis was used to measure phagocytosis. We used ELISA to analyse cytokine concentrations in response to CNI-1493 treatment. Western-blot/Dot-blot techniques were used to show the interaction of CNI-1493 with Abeta-oligomers as well as to measure apoptosis in microglia cells. RT-PCR was used to analyze secretase expression, and secretase function was determined using fluorimetric assays. CNI-1493 is able to prevent oligomer formation as well as apoptosis in microglia. A significant reduction was found in the Abeta-induced release of IL-6 and TNF-alpha in the presence of CNI-1493. Phagocytosis is an essential Abeta removal mechanism and was enhanced by CNI-1493 in primary microglia. CNI-1493 also influenced the alpha-secretase product C83 with an increase in the treated cells, while a simultaneous reduction in Abeta secretion was also observed. We hypothesize that CNI-1493 not only reduces neuroinflammation and consequent neurodegeneration, but also leads to a shift in AbetaPP-processing towards the non-amyloidogenic pathway. Therefore, CNI-1493 is a promising candidate for the treatment of AD.

21593566|t|Autoantibodies against amyloid and glial-derived antigens are increased in serum and cerebrospinal fluid of Lewy body-associated dementias.
21593566|a|There is increasing evidence that in Lewy body-associated dementias (encompassing Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)), the adaptive immune system is altered and the degenerative process includes glial cells in addition to neuronal structures. We therefore aimed to determine levels of autoantibodies against amyloid and glial-derived structures in these dementia types. Using a newly developed Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we measured levels of IgG autoantibodies against neuronal and glial structures in serum and cerebrospinal fluid of a total of 91 subjects (13 PDD, 14 DLB, 11 Alzheimer's disease (AD), 11 frontotemporal dementia (FTD), 11 vascular dementia patients (VaD), and 31 healthy controls). Autoantibody levels against alpha-synuclein, amyloid-beta42 (Abeta42), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), myelin basic protein (MBP), and S100B were determined. In all groups, autoantibody levels were about three magnitudes higher in serum than in CSF. Serum autoantibody levels against alpha-synuclein, Abeta42, MOG, MBP, and S100B were higher in PDD/DLB compared to tau-associated dementias (AD, FTD), VaD, and controls, respectively, with most of them reaching highly significant p-values. In cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), levels of antibodies against oligodendrocyte-derived antigens (MOG, MBP) were significantly increased in PDD/DLB. Increased levels of autoantibodies against both neuronal- and glial-derived antigens in serum and CSF of Lewy body-associated dementias indicate an altered activity of the adaptive immune system in these dementia types. The potential of neural-derived IgG autoantibodies as part of a biomarker panel for the diagnosis of Lewy body-associated dementias should be further evaluated.

21595698|t|Axonal injury in young pediatric head trauma: a comparison study of beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP) immunohistochemical staining in traumatic and nontraumatic deaths.
21595698|a|We tested the independent utility of beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP) immunohistochemical staining as evidence of brain trauma in the deaths of young children. Blinded reviewers retrospectively reviewed immunostained brain tissues from homicidal deaths, age-matched control cases without evidence of trauma, as well as cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The reviewers correctly identified five of the seven cases with documented inflicted head trauma. However, one of seven age-matched control cases and one of 10 SIDS/sudden unexplained death in infancy (SUDI) cases demonstrated staining patterns similar to those seen in cases of inflicted trauma. We discuss these cases and the circumstances surrounding them with the intent to explain the difficulties associated with immunohistological interpretation of axonal injury. Although the utility of beta-APP is quite powerful if not confounded by global hypoxic-ischemic injury, ultimately, beta-APP studies should be only one piece of information in the determination of cause and manner of death.

21601003|t|Amyloid-beta: the seeds of darkness.
21601003|a|Whilst the amyloid-beta (Abeta) hypothesis/centric theory continues to evolve, genetic, biochemical and pathological evidence still suggests that Abeta is central to the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In particular, Abeta-oligomers/soluble Abeta, may be an earlier determinant of Alzheimer's disease and better correlative of cognitive impairment. Whilst there are a number of Abeta-oligomeric species in existence (making therapeutic and diagnostic biomarker choice cumbersome), their existence is in equilibrium with Abeta-fibrils, the main constituent of cored plaques. Although Alzheimer's disease remains incurable, improvements to Abeta immunotherapies and strategies to target Abeta continue to evolve, with the reliance upon Abeta imaging to shed light on the outcome of therapeutics proving very useful.

21601614|t|Development of Alzheimer-disease neuroimaging-biomarkers using mouse models with amyloid-precursor protein-transgene expression.
21601614|a|There are important recent developments in Alzheimer's disease (AD) translational research, especially with respect to the imaging of amyloid pathology in vivo using MRI and PET technologies. Here we exploit the most widely used transgenic mouse models of amyloid pathology in order to relate the imaging findings to our knowledge about the histopathological phenotype of these models. The development of new diagnostic criteria of AD necessitates the use of biological markers to diagnose AD even in the absence of overt dementia or early symptomatic mild cognitive impairment. The validity of the diagnosis will depend on the availability of an in vivo marker to reflect underlying neurobiological changes of AD. Transgenic models with essential features of AD pathology and mechanisms provide a test setting for the development and evaluation of new biological imaging markers. Among the best established imaging markers of amyloid pathology in transgenic animals are high-field MRI of brain atrophy, proton spectroscopy of neurochemical changes, high-field MRI of amyloid plaque load, and in vivo plaque imaging using radio-labelled ligands with PET. We discuss the implications of the findings as well as the methodological limitations and the specific requirements of these technologies. We furthermore outline future directions of transgene-imaging research. Transgene imaging is an emerging area of translational research that implies strong multi- and interdisciplinary collaborations. It will become ever more valuable with the introduction of new diagnostic standards and novel treatment approaches which will require valid and reliable biological markers to improve the diagnosis and early treatment of AD patients.

21602806|t|Specification of transplantable astroglial subtypes from human pluripotent stem cells.
21602806|a|Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have been differentiated efficiently to neuronal cell types. However, directed differentiation of hPSCs to astrocytes and astroglial subtypes remains elusive. In this study, hPSCs were directed to nearly uniform populations of immature astrocytes (>90% S100beta(+) and GFAP(+)) in large quantities. The immature human astrocytes exhibit similar gene expression patterns as primary astrocytes, display functional properties such as glutamate uptake and promotion of synaptogenesis, and become mature astrocytes by forming connections with blood vessels after transplantation into the mouse brain. Furthermore, hPSC-derived neuroepithelia, patterned to rostral-caudal and dorsal-ventral identities with the same morphogens used for neuronal subtype specification, generate immature astrocytes that express distinct homeodomain transcription factors and display phenotypic differences of different astroglial subtypes. These human astroglial progenitors and immature astrocytes will be useful for studying astrocytes in brain development and function, understanding the roles of astrocytes in disease processes and developing novel treatments for neurological disorders.

21605634|t|APP/SOD1 overexpressing mice present reduced neuropathic pain sensitivity.
21605634|a|There are controversies regarding pain expression in mentally disabled people, including Down syndrome patients. The aim of this study was to examine neuropathic pain-related behavior and peripheral nerve regeneration in mouse model of Down syndrome. Sciatic nerves of double transgenic mice, overexpressing both amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) genes, and FVB/N wild type mice were transected and immediately resutured. Evaluation of autotomy and functional recovery was carried out during 4-week follow-up. We found markedly less severe autotomy in transgenic animals, although the onset of autotomy was significantly delayed in control mice. Interestingly, neuroma formation at the injury site was significantly more prominent in transgenic animals. Sciatic function index outcome was better in transgenic mice than in wild-type group. Histological evaluation revealed no statistically significant differences in the number of GAP-43-positive growth cones and macrophages in the distal stump of the transected nerve between groups. However, in transgenic animals, the regenerating axons were arranged more chaotically. The number of Schwann cells in the distal stump of the transected nerves was significantly lower in transgenic mice. The number of surviving motoneurons was markedly decreased in transgenic group. We measured also the atrophy of denervated muscles and found it decreased in APP/SOD1 overexpressing mice. Taken together, in this model of Down syndrome, we observed increased neuroma formation and decreased autotomy after peripheral nerve injury. Our findings suggest that APP/SOD1 overexpressing mice are less sensitive for neuropathic pain associated with neuroma.

21612223|t|Zn2+'s ability to alter the distribution of Cu2+ among the available binding sites of Abeta(1-16)-polyethylenglycol-ylated peptide: implications in Alzheimer's disease.
21612223|a|The formation of mixed copper(II) and zinc(II) complexes with Abeta(1-16)-PEG has been investigated. The peptide fragment forms stable mixed metal complexes at physiological pH in which the His13/His14 dyad is the zinc(II)'s preferred binding site, while copper(II) coordination occurs at the N-terminus also involving the His6 imidazole. Copper(II) is prevented by zinc(II) excess from the binding to the two His residues, His13 and His14. As the latter binding mode has been recently invoked to explain the redox activity of the copper-Abeta complex, the formation of ternary metal complexes may justify the recently proposed protective role of zinc(II) in Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, the reported results suggest that zinc(II) competes with copper for Abeta binding and inhibits copper-mediated Abeta redox chemistry.

21613623|t|Boosting brain uptake of a therapeutic antibody by reducing its affinity for a transcytosis target.
21613623|a|Monoclonal antibodies have therapeutic potential for treating diseases of the central nervous system, but their accumulation in the brain is limited by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Here, we show that reducing the affinity of an antibody for the transferrin receptor (TfR) enhances receptor-mediated transcytosis of the anti-TfR antibody across the BBB into the mouse brain where it reaches therapeutically relevant concentrations. Anti-TfR antibodies that bind with high affinity to TfR remain associated with the BBB, whereas lower-affinity anti-TfR antibody variants are released from the BBB into the brain and show a broad distribution 24 hours after dosing. We designed a bispecific antibody that binds with low affinity to TfR and with high affinity to the enzyme beta-secretase (BACE1), which processes amyloid precursor protein into amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides including those associated with Alzheimer's disease. Compared to monospecific anti-BACE1 antibody, the bispecific antibody accumulated in the mouse brain and led to a greater reduction in brain Abeta after a single systemic dose. TfR-facilitated transcytosis of this bispecific antibody across the BBB may enhance its potency as an anti-BACE1 therapy for treating Alzheimer's disease.

21616081|t|Monte Carlo study of the formation and conformational properties of dimers of Abeta42 variants.
21616081|a|Small soluble oligomers, and dimers in particular, of the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) are believed to play an important pathological role in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we investigate the spontaneous dimerization of Abeta42, with 42 residues, by implicit solvent all-atom Monte Carlo simulations, for the wild-type peptide and the mutants F20E, E22G and E22G/I31E. The observed dimers of these variants share many overall conformational characteristics but differ in several aspects at a detailed level. In all four cases, the most common type of secondary structure is intramolecular antiparallel beta-sheets. Parallel, in-register beta-sheet structure, as in models for Abeta fibrils, is rare. The primary force driving the formation of dimers is hydrophobic attraction. The conformational differences that we do see involve turns centered in the 20-30 region. The probability of finding turns centered in the 25-30 region, where there is a loop in Abeta fibrils, is found to increase upon dimerization and to correlate with experimentally measured rates of fibril formation for the different Abeta42 variants. Our findings hint at reorganization of this part of the molecule as a potentially critical step in Abeta aggregation.

21621545|a|Amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) is central to the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Of the two predominant Abeta alloforms, Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42), the latter forms more toxic oligomers. C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of Abeta were recently shown to inhibit Abeta(1-42) toxicity in vitro. Here, we studied Abeta(1-42) assembly in the presence of three effective CTF inhibitors and an ineffective fragment, Abeta(21-30). Using a discrete molecular dynamics approach that recently was shown to capture key differences between Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) oligomerization, we compared Abeta(1-42) oligomer formation in the absence and presence of CTFs or Abeta(21-30) and identified structural elements of Abeta(1-42) that correlated with Abeta(1-42) toxicity. CTFs co-assembled with Abeta(1-42) into large heterooligomers containing multiple Abeta(1-42) and inhibitor fragments. In contrast, Abeta(21-30) co-assembled with Abeta(1-42) into heterooligomers containing mostly a single Abeta(1-42) and multiple Abeta(21-30) fragments. The CTFs, but not Abeta(21-30), decreased the beta-strand propensity of Abeta(1-42) in a concentration-dependent manner. CTFs and Abeta(21-30) had a high binding propensity to the hydrophobic regions of Abeta(1-42), but only CTFs were found to bind the Abeta(1-42) region A2-F4. Consequently, only CTFs but not Abeta(21-30) reduced the solvent accessibility of Abeta(1-42) in region D1-R5. The reduced solvent accessibility of Abeta(1-42) in the presence of CTFs was comparable to the solvent accessibility of Abeta(1-40) oligomers formed in the absence of Abeta fragments. These findings suggest that region D1-R5, which was more exposed to the solvent in Abeta(1-42) than in Abeta(1-40) oligomers, is involved in mediating Abeta(1-42) oligomer neurotoxicity.

21622003|t|Synthesis and evaluation of benzofuran-2-yl(phenyl)methanone derivatives as ligands for beta-amyloid plaques.
21622003|a|A series of benzofuran-2-yl(phenyl)methanone derivatives were synthesized and evaluated as novel probes for beta-amyloid plaques. These derivatives were produced by a Rap-Stoermer condensation reaction. Compounds with a N,N-dimethylamino group displayed high affinity for Abeta(1-42) aggregates with K(i) values in the nanomolar range. Autoradiography with brain sections of AD model mice (APP/PS1) revealed that a radioiodinated probe, [(125)I]10, labeled beta-amyloid plaques selectively and displayed good brain uptake (3.53% ID/g) at 2 min. The results suggest that benzofuran-2-yl(phenyl)methanone derivatives should be investigated further as potential probes for detecting beta-amyloid plaques in the AD brain.

21624563|t|Florbetapir f-18: a histopathologically validated Beta-amyloid positron emission tomography imaging agent.
21624563|a|Florbetapir F-18 is a molecular imaging agent combining high affinity for beta-amyloid, pharmacokinetic properties that allow positron emission tomography (PET) imaging within a convenient time after dose administration, and the wide availability of the radionuclide fluorine-18. Florbetapir F-18 is prepared by nucleophilic radiofluorination in approximately 60 minutes with a decay-corrected yield of 20%-40% and with a specific activity typically exceeding 100 Ci/mmol. The florbetapir F-18 dissociation constant (K(d)) for binding to beta-amyloid in brain tissue from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients was 3.7 +- 0.3 nmol/L, and the maximum binding capacity (B(max)) was 8800 +- 1600 fmol/mg protein. Autoradiography studies have shown that florbetapir F-18 selectively binds to beta-amyloid aggregates in AD patient brain tissue, and the binding intensity is correlated with the density of beta-amyloid quantified by standard neuropathologic techniques. Studies in animals revealed no safety concerns and rapid and transient normal brain uptake (6.8% injected dose/g at 2 minutes and 1.9% injected dose/g at 60 minutes in the mouse). Florbetapir F-18 has been well-tolerated in studies of more than 2000 human subjects. Biodistribution studies in humans revealed predominantly hepatobiliary excretion. The whole body effective dose was 7 mSv from a dose of 370 MBq. The pharmacokinetic of florbetapir F-18 make it possible to obtain a PET image with a brief (10 minutes) acquisition time within a convenient time window of 30-90 minutes after dose administration. Clinical studies have demonstrated a clear correlation between in vivo PET imaging with florbetapir F-18 and postmortem histopathologic quantitation of beta-amyloid in the brain.

21629967|t|CALHM1 P86L polymorphism modulates CSF Abeta levels in cognitively healthy individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease.
21629967|a|The calcium homeostasis modulator 1 (CALHM1) gene codes for a novel cerebral calcium channel controlling intracellular calcium homeostasis and amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide metabolism, a key event in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The P86L polymorphism in CALHM1 (rs2986017) initially was proposed to impair CALHM1 functionally and to lead to an increase in Abeta accumulation in vitro in cell lines. Recently, it was reported that CALHM1 P86L also may influence Abeta metabolism in vivo by increasing Abeta levels in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Although the role of CALHM1 in AD risk remains uncertain, concordant data have now emerged showing that CALHM1 P86L is associated with an earlier age at onset of AD. Here, we have analyzed the association of CALHM1 P86L with CSF Abeta in samples from 203 AD cases and 46 young cognitively healthy individuals with a positive family history of AD. We failed to detect an association between the CALHM1 polymorphism and CSF Abeta levels in AD patients. Our data, however, revealed a significant association of CALHM1 P86L with elevated CSF Abeta42 and Abeta40 in the normal cohort at risk for AD. This work shows that CALHM1 modulates CSF Abeta levels in presymptomatic individuals, strengthening the notion that CALHM1 is involved in AD pathogenesis. These data further demonstrate the utility of endophenotype-based approaches focusing on CSF biomarkers for the identification or validation of risk factors for AD.

21630115|t|Postsynaptic degeneration as revealed by PSD-95 reduction occurs after advanced Abeta and tau pathology in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.
21630115|a|Impairment of synaptic plasticity underlies memory dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Molecules involved in this plasticity such as PSD-95, a major postsynaptic scaffold protein at excitatory synapses, may play an important role in AD pathogenesis. We examined the distribution of PSD-95 in transgenic mice of amyloidopathy (5XFAD) and tauopathy (JNPL3) as well as in AD brains using double-labeling immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. In wild type control mice, PSD-95 primarily labeled neuropil with distinct distribution in hippocampal apical dendrites. In 3-month-old 5XFAD mice, PSD-95 distribution was similar to that of wild type mice despite significant Abeta deposition. However, in 6-month-old 5XFAD mice, PSD-95 immunoreactivity in apical dendrites markedly decreased and prominent immunoreactivity was noted in neuronal soma in CA1 neurons. Similarly, PSD-95 immunoreactivity disappeared from apical dendrites and accumulated in neuronal soma in 14-month-old, but not in 3-month-old, JNPL3 mice. In AD brains, PSD-95 accumulated in Hirano bodies in hippocampal neurons. Our findings support the notion that either Abeta or tau can induce reduction of PSD-95 in excitatory synapses in hippocampus. Furthermore, this PSD-95 reduction is not an early event but occurs as the pathologies advance. Thus, the time-dependent PSD-95 reduction from synapses and accumulation in neuronal soma in transgenic mice and Hirano bodies in AD may mark postsynaptic degeneration that underlies long-term functional deficits.

21630409|t|Dissecting the role of single regions of an IAPP mimic and IAPP in inhibition of Abeta40 amyloid formation and cytotoxicity.
21630409|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are linked to the self-association of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) and islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), respectively. We have shown that IAPP-GI, a soluble IAPP analogue and mimic of nonamyloidogenic and nontoxic IAPP, binds Abeta with high affinity and blocks its cytotoxic self-assembly and fibrillogenesis. We have also shown that IAPP and Abeta interact with each other into nonfibrillar and nontoxic heterocomplexes that suppress cytotoxic self-association by both polypeptides. The Abeta-IAPP interaction might thus be a molecular link between AD and T2D. We studied the role of individual IAPP-GI and IAPP regions in their inhibitory function on Abeta40 self-association and cytotoxicity. We found that the presence of the two hot-spot regions of the Abeta-IAPP interaction interface in IAPP(8-28) is not sufficient for inhibitory function and that, in addition to IAPP(8-28), the presence of the N-terminal region IAPP(1-7) is absolutely required. By contrast, the C-terminal region, IAPP(30-37), is not required although its presence together with IAPP(1-7) in IAPP-GI results in a marked enhancement of the inhibitory effect as compared to IAPP(1-28)-GI. We suggest that the inhibitory effect of IAPP-GI and IAPP on Abeta40 fibrillogenesis and cell toxicity is mediated primarily by interactions involving the hot regions of the Abeta-IAPP interaction interface and the N terminus of IAPP while a concerted and likely structure-stabilizing action of the N- and C-terminal IAPP regions potentiates this effect. These results identify important molecular determinants of the amyloid suppressing function of the Abeta40-IAPP interaction and could contribute to the design of novel inhibitors of Abeta40 aggregation and cell degeneration.

21634787|t|Amyloid of the Candida albicans Ure2p prion domain is infectious and has an in-register parallel beta-sheet structure.
21634787|a|Ure2p of Candida albicans (Ure2(albicans) or CaUre2p) can be a prion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but Ure2p of Candida glabrata (Ure2(glabrata)) cannot, even though the Ure2(glabrata) N-terminal domain is more similar to that of the S. cerevisiae Ure2p (Ure2(cerevisiae)) than Ure2(albicans) is. We show that the N-terminal N/Q-rich prion domain of Ure2(albicans) forms amyloid that is infectious, transmitting [URE3alb] to S. cerevisiae cells expressing only C. albicans Ure2p. Using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance of selectively labeled C. albicans Ure2p(1-90), we show that this infectious amyloid has an in-register parallel beta-sheet structure, like that of the S. cerevisiae Ure2p prion domain and other S. cerevisiae prion amyloids. In contrast, the N/Q-rich N-terminal domain of Ure2(glabrata) does not readily form amyloid, and that formed upon prolonged incubation is not infectious.

21638202|t|Pathway-specific alteration of synaptic plasticity in Tg2576 mice.
21638202|a|Various animal models of Alzheimer disease (AD) are characterized by deficits in spatial memory that are causally related to altered synaptic function and impairment of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus. In Tg2576 AD mice, we compared LTP in 2 major hippocampal pathways, Schaffer collateral (SC) and mossy fiber (MF) pathways. Whereas LTP was completely abolished in the SC pathway of Tg2576 mice, we found no decrease in LTP induced by stimulation of the MF pathway. In fact, we found that in the MF pathway, LTP was slightly, but significantly, enhanced compared with that in the MF pathway of WT littermates. This pathway-specific impairment of LTP is not attributable to alterations in transmitter release, as indicated by an unaltered paired-pulse ratio. These results suggest that the spatial memory deficits normally seen in AD models arise primarily from LTP impairment at the SC pathway.

21640074|t|Hypoxia induces beta-amyloid in association with death of RGC-5 cells in culture.
21640074|a|Beta-amyloid (Abeta) derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been associated with retinal degeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and glaucoma. This study examined whether hypoxia exposure induces Abeta accumulation in RGC-5 cells. While levels of APP mRNA and protein significantly increased in the cells, elevated abundance of Abeta was also observed in cells and culture medium between 12 or 24 and 48h after 5% O(2) hypoxia treatment. Additionally, there is a close relationship between induction of APP and Abeta and intracellular accumulation of ROS along with loss of mitochondrial membrane potential followed by the death of RGC-5 cells in culture under hypoxia. These results suggest a possible involvement of APP and Abeta in the death of RGCs challenged by hypoxia.

21640783|t|The correlation of plasma Abeta42 levels, depressive symptoms, and cognitive function in the Korean elderly.
21640783|a|OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate whether plasma amyloid beta 1-42 (Abeta42) levels are associated with depressive symptoms and/or cognitive function in community dwelling elderly. METHODS: Subjects were 123 participants of a population-based project designed to screen community dwelling elderly older than 65 years old in Gangwon Province, Korea, for the early detection of depression and dementia. Symptoms of depression were assessed using the SGDS-K (Short Geriatric Depression Scale-Korean version), and the MMSE-KC (Mini-Mental State Examination-Korean version) was used to assess cognitive function. Plasma Abeta42 levels were measured with the human amyloid beta ELISA Kit. RESULTS: The elderly with depressive symptoms (SGDS-K score >= 8) had higher plasma Abeta42 levels than those without depressive symptoms (SGDS-K score<8) (p<0.1). Plasma Abeta42 levels were positively correlated with SGDS-K scores (p<0.05). However, MMSE-KC scores were inversely associated with plasma Abeta42 levels (p<0.01). Plasma beta42 levels were also associated with MMSE-KC (F=8.07, p<0.01) and SGDS-K (F=4.53, p<0.05) by generalized linear model (GLM) with controlling age, sex and education. CONCLUSION: Plasma Abeta42 levels were associated with depressive symptoms and cognitive function in community dwelling elderly. The present study supports the possibility that plasma Abeta may be involved in the development of late onset depression.

21642424|t|Loss of cleavage at beta'-site contributes to apparent increase in beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) secretion by beta-secretase (BACE1)-glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) processing of amyloid precursor protein.
21642424|a|Several lines of evidence implicate lipid raft microdomains in Alzheimer disease-associated beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) production. Notably, targeting beta-secretase (beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP)-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1)) exclusively to lipid rafts by the addition of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor to its ectodomain has been reported to elevate Abeta secretion. Paradoxically, Abeta secretion is not reduced by the expression of non-raft resident S-palmitoylation-deficient BACE1 (BACE1-4C/A (C474A/C478A/C482A/C485A)). We addressed this apparent discrepancy in raft microdomain-associated BACE1 processing of APP in this study. As previously reported, we found that expression of BACE1-GPI elevated Abeta secretion as compared with wild-type BACE1 (WTBACE1) or BACE1-4C/A. However, this increase occurred without any difference in the levels of APP ectodomain released following BACE1 cleavage (soluble APPbeta), arguing against an overall increase in BACE1 processing of APP per se. Further analysis revealed that WTBACE1 cleaves APP at beta- and beta'-sites, generating +1 and +11 beta-C-terminal fragments and secreting intact as well as N-terminally truncated Abeta. In contrast, three different BACE1-GPI chimeras preferentially cleaved APP at the beta-site, mainly generating +1 beta-C-terminal fragment and secreting intact Abeta. As a consequence, cells expressing BACE1-GPI secreted relatively higher levels of intact Abeta without an increase in BACE1 processing of APP. Markedly reduced cleavage at beta'-site exhibited by BACE1-GPI was cell type-independent and insensitive to subcellular localization of APP or the pathogenic KM/NL mutant. We conclude that the apparent elevation in Abeta secretion by BACE1-GPI is mainly attributed to preferential cleavage at the beta-site and failure to detect +11 Abeta species secreted by cells expressing WTBACE1.

21642429|t|Cu(II) mediates kinetically distinct, non-amyloidogenic aggregation of amyloid-beta peptides.
21642429|a|Cu(II) ions are implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease by influencing the aggregation of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide. Elucidating the underlying Cu(II)-induced Abeta aggregation is paramount for understanding the role of Cu(II) in the pathology of Alzheimer disease. The aim of this study was to characterize the qualitative and quantitative influence of Cu(II) on the extracellular aggregation mechanism and aggregate morphology of Abeta(1-40) using spectroscopic, microelectrophoretic, mass spectrometric, and ultrastructural techniques. We found that the Cu(II):Abeta ratio in solution has a major influence on (i) the aggregation kinetics/mechanism of Abeta, because three different kinetic scenarios were observed depending on the Cu(II):Abeta ratio, (ii) the metal:peptide stoichiometry in the aggregates, which increased to 1.4 at supra-equimolar Cu(II):Abeta ratio; and (iii) the morphology of the aggregates, which shifted from fibrillar to non-fibrillar at increasing Cu(II):Abeta ratios. We observed dynamic morphological changes of the aggregates, and that the formation of spherical aggregates appeared to be a common morphological end point independent on the Cu(II) concentration. Experiments with Abeta(1-42) were compatible with the conclusions for Abeta(1-40) even though the low solubility of Abeta(1-42) precluded examination under the same conditions as for the Abeta(1-40). Experiments with Abeta(1-16) and Abeta(1-28) showed that other parts than the Cu(II)-binding His residues were important for Cu(II)-induced Abeta aggregation. Based on this study we propose three mechanistic models for the Cu(II)-induced aggregation of Abeta(1-40) depending on the Cu(II):Abeta ratio, and identify key reaction steps that may be feasible targets for preventing Cu(II)-associated aggregation or toxicity in Alzheimer disease.

21642435|t|Suppression of amyloid beta A11 antibody immunoreactivity by vitamin C: possible role of heparan sulfate oligosaccharides derived from glypican-1 by ascorbate-induced, nitric oxide (NO)-catalyzed degradation.
21642435|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) is generated from the copper- and heparan sulfate (HS)-binding amyloid precursor protein (APP) by proteolytic processing. APP supports S-nitrosylation of the HS proteoglycan glypican-1 (Gpc-1). In the presence of ascorbate, there is NO-catalyzed release of anhydromannose (anMan)-containing oligosaccharides from Gpc-1-nitrosothiol. We investigated whether these oligosaccharides interact with Abeta during APP processing and plaque formation. anMan immunoreactivity was detected in amyloid plaques of Alzheimer (AD) and APP transgenic (Tg2576) mouse brains by immunofluorescence microscopy. APP/APP degradation products detected by antibodies to the C terminus of APP, but not Abeta oligomers detected by the anti-Abeta A11 antibody, colocalized with anMan immunoreactivity in Tg2576 fibroblasts. A 50-55-kDa anionic, sodium dodecyl sulfate-stable, anMan- and Abeta-immunoreactive species was obtained from Tg2576 fibroblasts using immunoprecipitation with anti-APP (C terminus). anMan-containing HS oligo- and disaccharide preparations modulated or suppressed A11 immunoreactivity and oligomerization of Abeta42 peptide in an in vitro assay. A11 immunoreactivity increased in Tg2576 fibroblasts when Gpc-1 autoprocessing was inhibited by 3-beta[2(diethylamino)ethoxy]androst-5-en-17-one (U18666A) and decreased when Gpc-1 autoprocessing was stimulated by ascorbate. Neither overexpression of Gpc-1 in Tg2576 fibroblasts nor addition of copper ion and NO donor to hippocampal slices from 3xTg-AD mice affected A11 immunoreactivity levels. However, A11 immunoreactivity was greatly suppressed by the subsequent addition of ascorbate. We speculate that temporary interaction between the Abeta domain and small, anMan-containing oligosaccharides may preclude formation of toxic Abeta oligomers. A portion of the oligosaccharides are co-secreted with the Abeta peptides and deposited in plaques. These results support the notion that an inadequate supply of vitamin C could contribute to late onset AD in humans.

21645162|t|Mechanism of PrP-amyloid formation in mice without transmissible spongiform encephalopathy.
21645162|a|Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker (GSS) P102L disease is a familial form of a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) that can present with or without vacuolation of neuropil. Inefficient disease transmission into 101LL transgenic mice was previously observed from GSS P102L without vacuolation. However, several aged, healthy mice had large plaques composed of abnormal prion protein (PrP(d)). Here we perform the ultrastructural characterization of such plaques and compare them with PrP(d) aggregates found in TSE caused by an infectious mechanism. PrP(d) plaques in 101LL mice varied in maturity, with some being composed of deposits without visible amyloid fibrils. PrP(d) was present on cell membranes in the vicinity of all types of plaques. In contrast to the unicentric plaques seen in infectious murine scrapie, the plaques seen in the current model were multicentric and were initiated by protofibrillar forms of PrP(d) situated on oligodendroglia, astrocytes and neuritic cell membranes. We speculate that the initial conversion process leading to plaque formation begins with membrane-bound PrP(C) but that subsequent fibrillization does not require membrane attachment. We also observed that the membrane alterations consistently seen in murine scrapie and other infectious TSEs were not present in 101LL mice with plaques, suggesting differences in the pathogenesis of these conditions.

21645521|t|Amyloid fibrillation kinetics: insight from atomistic nucleation theory.
21645521|a|We consider the nucleation of nanosized amyloid fibrils composed of successively layered beta-sheets at the molecular level when this process takes place by direct polymerization of protein segments (beta-strands) into beta-sheets. Application of the atomistic nucleation theory (ANT) to amyloid nucleation of beta(2)-microglobulin and amyloid beta(40) allows us to predict the fibril nucleus size and the fibril nucleation rate as functions of the supersaturation of the protein solution. The ANT predictions are compared to recent time-resolved optical experiments where they measure the effect of the protein concentration and mutations on the initial lag time before amyloid fibrils form in the protein solution. The presented analysis reveals the general principles underlying the nucleation kinetics of nanosized amyloid fibrils and indicates that it can be treated in the framework of existing general theories of the nucleation of new phases.

21646356|t|Metalloprotease meprin beta generates nontoxic N-terminal amyloid precursor protein fragments in vivo.
21646356|a|Identification of physiologically relevant substrates is still the most challenging part in protease research for understanding the biological activity of these enzymes. The zinc-dependent metalloprotease meprin beta is known to be expressed in many tissues with functions in health and disease. Here, we demonstrate unique interactions between meprin beta and the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Although APP is intensively studied as a ubiquitously expressed cell surface protein, which is involved in Alzheimer disease, its precise physiological role and relevance remain elusive. Based on a novel proteomics technique termed terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates (TAILS), APP was identified as a substrate for meprin beta. Processing of APP by meprin beta was subsequently validated using in vitro and in vivo approaches. N-terminal APP fragments of about 11 and 20 kDa were found in human and mouse brain lysates but not in meprin beta(-/-) mouse brain lysates. Although these APP fragments were in the range of those responsible for caspase-induced neurodegeneration, we did not detect cytotoxicity to primary neurons treated by these fragments. Our data demonstrate that meprin beta is a physiologically relevant enzyme in APP processing.

21647937|t|Synaptic failure and adenosine triphosphate imbalance induced by amyloid-beta aggregates are prevented by blueberry-enriched polyphenols extract.
21647937|a|The potential neuroprotective properties of fruits have been widely recognized. In this study, we evaluated the protective properties of a blueberry extract (BB-4), rich in polyphenols, in a neurodegenerative model induced by amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta). Chronic treatment with Abeta drastically reduced synaptic transmission and the extent of secretory vesicles, which were recovered partially with BB-4. Also, the extract recovered Ca(2+) transients in hippocampal neurons preincubated with Abeta (0.5 and 5 muM) by about 25% +- 3% and 30% +- 2, respectively. In this work, we demonstrate a novel effect of the BB-4 extract on Abeta-induced ATP leakage, in which this extract was able to antagonize the acute ATP leakage but not chronic ATP depletion. On the other hand, BB-4 prevented the uncoupling of mitochondrial function induced by FCCP by about 85%, but it was unable to modify the uncoupling induced by Abeta. The present results strongly indicate that BB-4 plays a role in the process of Abeta aggregation by reducing the toxic species (i.e., 40 kDa). These findings suggest that a blueberry extract can protect neuronal tissue from Abeta toxicity mainly through its antiaggregation property, and its antioxidant properties and mitochondrial membrane potential capacities are secondary mechanisms important in chronic stages. Our work suggests that BB-4 could be an important nutritional complement to neuronal health as well as a potential nutraceutical formulation useful as a dietary supplement in the elderly.

21648462|t|Effects of Cu ions and explicit water molecules on the copper binding domain of amyloid precursor protein APP(131-189): a molecular dynamics study.
21648462|a|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a cell-surface trans-membrane glycoprotein that appears to play an important role in in vivo Cu ion homeostasis. This protein includes a copper-binding-domain (CuBD) fragment consisting of residues 124-189, of which His147, His151, Tyr168, and possibly Met170 comprise the explicit Cu-binding site (CuBS). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are carried out on Cu-free and Cu-bound APP models, based on crystal structures including residues 131-189 obtained from the Protein Data Bank, to confirm the site of Cu-ion binding and to elucidate the effects of the oxidation state of the Cu ions (default GROMACS parameters modeled only the electrostatic binding to the Cu ions at the CuBS) and explicit water molecules on the conformational properties of the 131-189 residue portion of the CuBD. MD trajectory analysis demonstrated a conformational change of Met170. The sulfur atom of Met170 moves closer to the Cu(II) ion and away from Cu(I), and this change may play an important role in the reduction of Cu(II) and the release of Cu(I). Two explicit water molecules were included in the MD simulations. These water molecules that bind strongly to the Cu ions via their lone pair electrons result in a significant modification of the binding interactions with the other residues at the CuBS.

21649759|t|Astrocytes in the aging brain express characteristics of senescence-associated secretory phenotype.
21649759|a|Cellular stress increases progressively with aging in mammalian tissues. Chronic stress triggers several signaling cascades that can induce a condition called cellular senescence. Recent studies have demonstrated that senescent cells express a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Emerging evidence indicates that the number of cells expressing biomarkers of cellular senescence increases in tissues with aging, which implies that cellular senescence is an important player in organismal aging. In the brain, the aging process is associated with degenerative changes, e.g. synaptic loss and white matter atrophy, which lead to progressive cognitive impairment. There is substantial evidence for the presence of oxidative, proteotoxic and metabolic stresses in aging brain. A low-level, chronic inflammatory process is also present in brain during aging. Astrocytes demonstrate age-related changes that resemble those of the SASP: (i) increased level of intermediate glial fibrillary acidic protein and vimentin filaments, (ii) increased expression of several cytokines and (iii) increased accumulation of proteotoxic aggregates. In addition, in vitro stress evokes a typical senescent phenotype in cultured astrocytes and, moreover, isolated astrocytes from aged brain display the proinflammatory phenotype. All of these observations indicate that astrocytes are capable of triggering the SASP and the astrocytes in aging brain display typical characteristics of cellular senescence. Bearing in mind the many functions of astrocytes, it is evident that the age-related senescence of astrocytes enhances the decline in functional capacity of the brain. We will review the astroglial changes occurring during aging and emphasize that senescent astrocytes can have an important role in age-related neuroinflammation and neuronal degeneration.

21651893|t|Attenuation of neurodegenerative phenotypes in Alzheimer-like presenilin 1/presenilin 2 conditional double knockout mice by EUK1001, a promising derivative of xanomeline.
21651893|a|The M1/M4-preferring muscarinic agonist xanomeline was found to have some benefit in the treatment of the memory impairment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but side effects precluded further development. EUK1001, a fluorinated derivative of xanomeline, because of greater affinity for M1 muscarinic receptors, is likely to have a significantly better side effect profile than xanomeline. We have now studied the effects of 3-month chronic administration of EUK1001 and xanomeline (0.5mg/kg/day) in AD-like presenilin 1/presenilin 2 conditional double knockout (PS cDKO) mice. Only EUK1001 was found to significantly ameliorate the deficit in recognition memory. Histological analysis demonstrated partial attenuation of the brain atrophy in EUK1001-treated PS cDKO mice and minimal effect in the xanomeline-treated mice. Both compounds effectively suppressed the elevation of brain tau phosphorylation in the PS cDKO mice, but neither inhibited the increased inflammatory responses. These results indicate that EUK1001 showed superiority to xanomeline with regard to attenuation of several AD-like neurodegenerative phenotypes in PS cDKO mice. These results suggest further investigation of the development of EUK1001 for the treatment of AD is indicated.

21652214|t|Neuroprotective effects of linarin through activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in amyloid-beta-induced neuronal cell death.
21652214|a|Linarin, a natural occurring flavanol glycoside derived from Mentha arvensis and Buddleja davidii is known to have anti-acetylcholinesterase effects. The present study intended to explore the neuroprotective effects of linarin against Abeta(25-35)-induced neurotoxicity with cultured rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12 cells) and the possible mechanisms involved. For this purpose, PC12 cells were cultured and exposed to 30 muM Abeta(25-35) in the absence or presence of linarin (0.1, 1.0 and 10 muM). In addition, the potential contribution of the PI3K/Akt neuroprotective pathway in linarin-mediated protection against Abeta(25-35)-induced neurotoxicity was also investigated. The results showed that linarin dose-dependently increased cell viability and reduced the number of apoptotic cells as measured by MTT assay, Annexin-V/PI staining, JC-1 staining and caspase-3 activity assay. Linarin could also inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity induced by Abeta(25-35) in PC12 cells. Further study revealed that linarin induced the phosphorylation of Akt dose-dependently. Treatment of PC12 cells with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 attenuated the protective effects of linarin. Furthermore, linarin also stimulated phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), a downstream target of PI3K/Akt. Moreover, the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was also increased by linarin treatment. These results suggest that linarin prevents Abeta(25-35)-induced neurotoxicity through the activation of PI3K/Akt, which subsequently inhibits GSK-3beta and up-regulates Bcl-2. These findings raise the possibility that linarin may be a potent therapeutic compound against Alzheimer's disease acting through both acetylcholinesterase inhibition and neuroprotection.

21652708|t|Characterization of oligomer formation of amyloid-beta peptide using a split-luciferase complementation assay.
21652708|a|Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is the amyloid component of senile plaques in Alzheimer disease (AD) brains. Recently a soluble oliomeric form of Abeta in Abeta precursor protein transgenic mouse brains and AD brains was identified as a potential causative molecule for memory impairment, suggesting that soluble Abeta oligomers cause neurodegeneration in AD. Further characterization of this species has been hampered, however, because the concentrations are quite small and it is difficult to monitor Abeta oligomers specifically. Here we developed a novel method for monitoring Abeta oligomers using a split-luciferase complementation assay. In this assay, the N- and C-terminal fragments of Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) are fused separately to Abeta. We found that conditioned media from both N- and C-terminal fragments of Gluc-tagged Abeta1-42 doubly transfected HEK293 cells showed strong luminescence. We used gel filtration analyses to analyze the size of oligomers formed by the luciferase complementation assay, and found that it matched closely with oligomers formed by endogenous Abeta in Tg2576 neurons. Large oligomers (24-36-mers), 8-mers, trimers, and dimers predominate. In both systems, Abeta formed oligomers intracellularly, which then appear to be secreted as oligomers. We then evaluated several factors that might impact oligomer formation. The level of oligomerization of Abeta1-40 was similar to that of Abeta1-42. Homodimers formed more readily than heterodimers. The level of oligomerization of murine Abeta1-42 was similar to that of human Abeta1-42. As expected, the familial AD-linked Arctic mutation (E22G) significantly enhanced oligomer formation. These data suggest that Gluc-tagged Abeta enables the analysis of Abeta oligomers.

21654060|t|Novel anti-inflammatory compound SEN1176 alleviates behavioral deficits induced following bilateral intrahippocampal injection of aggregated amyloid-beta1-42.
21654060|a|Behavioral effects of a novel anti-inflammatory SEN1176 were investigated. This pyrrolo[3,2-e][1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine suppresses amyloid-beta (Abeta)1-42-induced macrophage production of nitric oxide, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 in a dose-dependent fashion, an activity profile consistent with SEN1176 being a neuroinflammation inhibitor. Using male Sprague-Dawley rats, SEN1176 was examined relative to detrimental behavioral effects induced following bilateral intrahippocampal (IH) injections of aggregated Abeta1-42. The rats were trained to respond under an alternating-lever cyclic-ratio (ALCR) schedule of food reinforcement, enabling measurement of parameters of operant performance that reflect aspects of learning and memory. Under the ALCR schedule, orally administered SEN1176 at 5, 20, or 30 mg/kg was effective in reducing the behavioral deficit caused by bilateral IH aggregated Abeta1-42 injections in a dose-related manner over a 90-day treatment period. SEN1176 at 20 and 30 mg/kg significantly reduced lever switching errors and, at doses of 5, 10, and 30 mg/kg, significantly reduced incorrect lever perseverations, indicating a reduction of the behavioral deficit induced as a result of inflammation following IH Abeta1-42 injections. When treatment with SEN1176 was instigated 30 days after IH Abeta1-42 injections, it resulted in progressive protection, and withdrawal of SEN1176 treatment 60 days after IH Abeta1-42 injections revealed partial retention of the protective effect. SEN1176 also significantly reduced numbers of activated astrocytes adjacent to the aggregated Abeta1-42 injection sites. These results indicate the potential of SEN1176 for alleviating chronic neuroinflammatory processes related to brain Abeta deposition that affect learning and memory in Alzheimer's disease.

21654468|t|Intercalary segmental reconstruction of long bones after malignant bone tumor resection using primary methyl methacrylate cement spacer interposition and secondary bone grafting: the induced membrane technique.
21654468|a|BACKGROUND: Bone reconstruction after surgical resection of malignant bone tumor in children remains a difficult challenge and various techniques exist. Induced membrane reconstruction as described by Masquelet et al has been reported in traumatic large bone defects. We have been using this 2-stage technique after primary malignant bone tumors resection in children since 2000. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 12 cases: 6 Ewing sarcomas and 6 osteosarcomas. Mean age of the patients was 9 years old (range, 3 to 15.5 y). Surgical treatment consisted of wide resection and insertion of a cement spacer then secondary bone grafting. All patients had neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy and 2 patients had adjuvant radiotherapy. RESULTS: Surgical excision was complete in all cases. There was no local recurrence at 6.2 years (range, 4.6 to 9.1 y) follow-up. Three patients had pulmonary metastasis (of whom 1 deceased) and 1 had a metastasis on the contralateral limb. The 11 patients operated on the lower limb achieved weight bearing 4.1 months (range, 0.2 to 14.2 mo) after the second stage of the procedure. Complications were numerous with 7 nonunions (4 unifocal and 3 bifocal), 5 fractures (in 4 patients), 5 protruding wires (in 4 patients), and 2 femoral varus deformities. There was no infection. CONCLUSIONS: Induced membrane reconstruction seems to be a simple and reliable technique in pediatric bone tumors and these results are promising. Extended use of locking nails could reduce the high rate of nonunion though it is not always possible in skeletally immature patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV (case series).

21654636|t|Interaction between prion protein and toxic amyloid beta assemblies can be therapeutically targeted at multiple sites.
21654636|a|A role for PrP in the toxic effect of oligomeric forms of Abeta, implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), has been suggested but remains controversial. Here we show that PrP is required for the plasticity-impairing effects of ex vivo material from human AD brain and that standardized Abeta-derived diffusible ligand (ADDL) preparations disrupt hippocampal synaptic plasticity in a PrP-dependent manner. We screened a panel of anti-PrP antibodies for their ability to disrupt the ADDL-PrP interaction. Antibodies directed to the principal PrP/Abeta-binding site and to PrP helix-1, were able to block Abeta binding to PrP suggesting that the toxic Abeta species are of relatively high molecular mass and/or may bind multiple PrP molecules. Two representative and extensively characterized monoclonal antibodies directed to these regions, ICSM-35 and ICSM-18, were shown to block the Abeta-mediated disruption of synaptic plasticity validating these antibodies as candidate therapeutics for AD either individually or in combination.

21658472|t|Functionalization of liposomes with ApoE-derived peptides at different density affects cellular uptake and drug transport across a blood-brain barrier model.
21658472|a|A promising strategy to enhance blood-brain barrier penetration by drugs is the functionalization of nanocarriers with uptake-facilitating ligands. We studied the cellular uptake, by cultured RBE4 brain capillary endothelial cells, of nanoliposomes (NLs) covalently coupled with monomer or tandem dimer of apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-derived peptides (residues 141-150), at various densities. NLs without functionalization did not show either relevant membrane accumulation or cellular uptake, as monitored by confocal microscopy and quantified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Functionalization with peptides mediated an efficient NLs uptake that increased with peptide density; NLs carrying monomeric peptide performed the best. Moreover, we studied the ability of ApoE-NLs to enhance the transport of a drug payload through a RBE4 cell monolayer. The permeability of a tritiated curcumin derivative was enhanced after its entrapment into ApoE-NLs, in particular those functionalized with the dimer (+83% with respect to free drug, P < 0.01). Thus, these NLs appear particularly suitable for implementing further strategies for drug brain targeting.

21665950|t|Soluble oligomers of amyloid-beta peptide disrupt membrane trafficking of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptor contributing to early synapse dysfunction.
21665950|a|beta-Amyloid (Abeta), a peptide generated from the amyloid precursor protein, is widely believed to underlie the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease (AD). Emerging evidences suggest that soluble Abeta oligomers adversely affect synaptic function, leading to cognitive failure associated with AD. The Abeta-induced synaptic dysfunction has been attributed to the synaptic removal of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors (AMPARs). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the loss of AMPAR induced by Abeta at synapses are largely unknown. In this study we have examined the effect of Abeta oligomers on phosphorylated GluA1 at serine 845, a residue that plays an essential role in the trafficking of AMPARs toward extrasynaptic sites and the subsequent delivery to synapses during synaptic plasticity events. We found that Abeta oligomers reduce basal levels of Ser-845 phosphorylation and surface expression of AMPARs affecting AMPAR subunit composition. Abeta-induced GluA1 dephosphorylation and reduced receptor surface levels are mediated by an increase in calcium influx into neurons through ionotropic glutamate receptors and activation of the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin. Moreover, Abeta oligomers block the extrasynaptic delivery of AMPARs induced by chemical synaptic potentiation. In addition, reduced levels of total and phosphorylated GluA1 are associated with initial spatial memory deficits in a transgenic mouse model of AD. These findings indicate that Abeta oligomers could act as a synaptic depressor affecting the mechanisms involved in the targeting of AMPARs to the synapses during early stages of the disease.

21669222|t|Cognitive and histological disturbances after chlorpyrifos exposure and chronic Abeta(1-42) infusions in Wistar rats.
21669222|a|Exposure to pesticides has been linked to an increased vulnerability to neurodegenerative diseases. In order to study whether the exposure to the organophosphate chlorpyrifos renders the brain prone to amyloid-beta peptide deposition and accelerates its neuropathological and behavioural effects, Wistar rats were injected a single subcutaneous dose of chlorpyrifos (250 mg/kg) and subsequently infused with Abeta(1-42) peptide (i.c.v.) for 15 days. No effects of either treatment were noted in the classic water maze test. The animals infused with Abeta peptide showed worse performance when the platform was both hidden and moved from trial to trial. Both groups showed worse performance when the platform was visible and moved from trial to trial. No amyloid deposition was observed in hippocampus or cerebral cortex after the infusion period, although microtubule-associated protein 1A (MAP1A) immunoreactivity was significantly reduced in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, whereas chlorpyrifos exposure produced a significant reduction of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) in the prefrontal cortex. Therefore, behavioural deficits could be related to a loss of dendrite and spine processes in these brain regions.

21670152|t|Sequestration of toxic oligomers by HspB1 as a cytoprotective mechanism.
21670152|a|Small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are molecular chaperones that protect cells from cytotoxic effects of protein misfolding and aggregation. HspB1, an sHsp commonly associated with senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD), prevents the toxic effects of Abeta aggregates in vitro. However, the mechanism of this chaperone activity is poorly understood. Here, we observed that in two distinct transgenic mouse models of AD, mouse HspB1 (Hsp25) localized to the penumbral areas of plaques. We have demonstrated that substoichiometric amounts of human HspB1 (Hsp27) abolish the toxicity of Abeta oligomers on N2a (mouse neuroblastoma) cells. Using biochemical methods, spectroscopy, light scattering, and microscopy methods, we found that HspB1 sequesters toxic Abeta oligomers and converts them into large nontoxic aggregates. HspB1 was overexpressed in N2a cells in response to treatment with Abeta oligomers. Cultured neurons from HspB1-deficient mice were more sensitive to oligomer-mediated toxicity than were those from wild-type mice. Our results suggest that sequestration of oligomers by HspB1 constitutes a novel cytoprotective mechanism of proteostasis. Whether chaperone-mediated cytoprotective sequestration of toxic aggregates may bear clues to plaque deposition and may have potential therapeutic implications must be investigated in the future.

21670386|t|Longitudinal change of biomarkers in cognitive decline.
21670386|a|OBJECTIVE: To delineate the trajectories of Abeta42 level in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), fludeoxyglucose F18 (FDG) uptake using positron emission tomography, and hippocampal volume using magnetic resonance imaging and their relative associations with cognitive change at different stages in aging and Alzheimer disease (AD). DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: The 59 study sites for the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 819 participants 55 to 90 years of age with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and AD who were followed up during the period from 2005 to 2007. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of change in level of Abeta42 in CSF, FDG uptake, hippocampal volume, and the Alzheimer Disease's Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale score during up to 36 months of follow-up by diagnostic group as well as prediction of cognitive change by each biomarker. RESULTS: Reductions in the level of Abeta42 in CSF were numerically greater in participants with normal cognition than in participants with mild cognitive impairment or AD; whereas both glucose metabolic decline and hippocampal atrophy were significantly slower in participants with normal cognition than in participants with mild cognitive impairment or AD. Positive APOE4 status accelerated hippocampal atrophic changes in participants with mild cognitive impairment or AD, but did not modify rates of change in level of Abeta42 in CSF or FDG uptake. The Alzheimer Disease's Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale scores were related only to the baseline level of Abeta42 in CSF and the baseline FDG uptake in participants with normal cognition, which were about equally associated with change in FDG uptake and hippocampal volume in participants with mild cognitive impairment and best modeled by change in FDG uptake in participants with AD. CONCLUSION: Trajectories of Abeta42 level in CSF, FDG uptake, and hippocampal volume vary across different cognitive stages. The longitudinal patterns support a hypothetical sequence of AD pathology in which amyloid deposition is an early event before hypometabolism or hippocampal atrophy, suggesting that biomarker prediction for cognitive change is stage dependent.

21671331|t|Polyphenolic glycosides and aglycones utilize opposing pathways to selectively remodel and inactivate toxic oligomers of amyloid beta.
21671331|a|Substantial evidence suggests that soluble prefibrillar oligomers of the Abeta42 peptide associated with Alzheimer's disease are the most cytotoxic aggregated Abeta isoform. Limited previous work has revealed that aromatic compounds capable of remodeling Abeta oligomers into nontoxic conformers typically do so by converting them into off-pathway aggregates instead of dissociating them into monomers. Towards identifying small-molecule antagonists capable of selectively dissociating toxic Abeta oligomers into soluble peptide at substoichiometric concentrations, we have investigated the pathways used by polyphenol aglycones and their glycosides to remodel Abeta soluble oligomers. We find that eleven polyphenol aglycones of variable size and structure utilize the same remodeling pathway whereby Abeta oligomers are rapidly converted into large, off-pathway aggregates. Strikingly, we find that glycosides of these polyphenols all utilize a distinct remodeling pathway in which Abeta oligomers are rapidly dissociated into soluble, disaggregated peptide. This disaggregation activity is a synergistic combination of the aglycone and glycone moieties because combinations of polyphenols and sugars fail to disaggregate Abeta oligomers. We also find that polyphenolic glycosides and aglycones use the same opposing pathways to remodel Abeta fibrils. Importantly, both classes of polyphenols fail to remodel nontoxic Abeta oligomers (which are indistinguishable in size and morphology to Abeta soluble oligomers) or promote aggregation of freshly disaggregated Abeta peptide; thus revealing that they are specific for remodeling toxic Abeta conformers. We expect that these and related small molecules will be powerful chemical probes for investigating the conformational and cellular underpinnings of Abeta-mediated toxicity.

21672962|t|Telomere shortening reduces Alzheimer's disease amyloid pathology in mice.
21672962|a|Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder of the elderly and advancing age is the major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease development. Telomere shortening represents one of the molecular causes of ageing that limits the proliferative capacity of cells, including neural stem cells. Studies on telomere lengths in patients with Alzheimer's disease have revealed contrary results and the functional role of telomere shortening on brain ageing and Alzheimer's disease is not known. Here, we have investigated the effects of telomere shortening on adult neurogenesis and Alzheimer's disease progression in mice. The study shows that aged telomerase knockout mice with short telomeres (G3Terc-/-) exhibit reduced dentate gyrus neurogenesis and loss of neurons in hippocampus and frontal cortex, associated with short-term memory deficit in comparison to mice with long telomere reserves (Terc+/+). In contrast, telomere shortening improved the spatial learning ability of ageing APP23 transgenic mice, a mouse model for Alzheimer's disease. Telomere shortening was also associated with an activation of microglia in ageing amyloid-free brain. However, in APP23 transgenic mice, telomere shortening reduced both amyloid plaque pathology and reactive microgliosis. Together, these results provide the first experimental evidence that telomere shortening, despite impairing adult neurogenesis and maintenance of post-mitotic neurons, can slow down the progression of amyloid plaque pathology in Alzheimer's disease, possibly involving telomere-dependent effects on microglia activation.

21673407|t|Cerebral serotonin 4 receptors and amyloid-beta in early Alzheimer's disease.
21673407|a|The 5-HT4 receptor may play a role in memory and learning and 5-HT4 receptor activation has been suggested to modulate acetylcholine release and to reduce amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation. The aim of this study was for the first time to investigate the in vivo cerebral 5-HT4 receptor binding in early Alzheimer disease (AD) patients in relation to cortical Abeta burden. Eleven newly diagnosed untreated AD patients (mean MMSE 24, range 19-27) and twelve age- and gender-matched healthy controls underwent a two-hour dynamic [11C]SB207145 PET scan to measure the binding potential of the 5-HT4 receptor. All AD patients and eight healthy controls additionally underwent a [11C]PIB PET scan to measure the cortical Abeta burden. When AD patients were defined on clinical criteria, no difference in cerebral 5-HT4 receptor binding between AD patients and healthy controls was found (p = 0.54). However, when individuals were reassigned to groups according to their amyloid status, the PIB-positive individuals had 13% higher 5-HT4 receptor levels than PIB-negative individuals (p = 0.02) and the importance of classification of groups is emphasized. The 5-HT4 receptor binding was a positively correlated to Abeta burden (p = 0.03) and negatively to MMSE score of the AD patients (p = 0.02). Our data suggests that cerebral 5-HT4 receptor upregulation starts at a preclinical stage of and continues while dementia is still at a mild stage, which contrasts other receptor subtypes. We speculate that this may either be a compensatory effect of decreased levels of interstitial 5-HT, an attempt to improve cognitive function, increase acetylcholine release or to counteract Abeta accumulation.

21674237|t|Sphingosylphosphorylcholine attenuated beta-amyloid production by reducing BACE1 expression and catalysis in PC12 cells.
21674237|a|Abnormal accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) is the main characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain and Abeta peptides are generated from proteolytic cleavages of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-site APP-converting enzyme 1 (BACE1) and presenilin 1 (PS1). Sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC), a choline-containing sphingolipid, showed suppressive effect on Abeta production in PC12 cells which stably express Swedish mutant of amyloid precursor protein (APPsw). SPC (> 3 muM) significantly lowered the accumulation of Abeta40/42 and the expression of BACE1. However, the transcriptions of other APP processing enzymes like ADAM10 and PS1 were not affected by the SPC addition. Meanwhile, phosphocholine (PC) or other lysophospholipids, such as lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), sphingosyl-1-phosphate (S1P), did not alter BACE1 expression. Down-regulatory effect of SPC on BACE1 expression appeared to be mediated by NF-kappaB which is known to suppress the trans-activation of BACE1 promoter in PC12 cells. Here, the nuclear tanslocation of NF-kappaB was enhanced by SPC treatment in immune-fluorescent image analysis and NF-kappaB reporter assay. Furthermore, the catalytic activities of BACE1 and BACE2 were dose-dependently inhibited by SPC displaying IC50 values of 2.79 muM and 12.05 muM, respectively. Overall, these data suggest that SPC has the potential to ameliorate Abeta pathology in neurons by down-regulating the BACE1-mediated amyloidogenic pathway.

21679734|t|Bilobalide regulates soluble amyloid precursor protein release via phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase-dependent pathway.
21679734|a|Bilobalide (BB) is a sesquiterpenoid extracted from Ginkgo biloba leaves. An increasing number of studies have demonstrated its neuroprotective effects. The neuroprotective mechanisms may be associated with modulation of intracellular signaling cascades such as the phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Using differentiated SH-SY5Y cells, this study investigated whether BB modulation of intracellular signaling pathways, such as the protein kinase C (PKC) and PI3K pathways, contributes to amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, a key event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We demonstrated in this study that BB enhanced the secretion of alpha-secretase-cleaved soluble amyloid precursor protein (sAPPalpha, a by-product of non-amyloidogenic processing of APP) and decreased the beta amyloid protein (Abeta, a by-product of amyloidogenic processing of APP) via PI3K-dependent pathway. The PI3K pathway mediated the rapid effect of BB on APP processing possibly via regulation of intracellular APP trafficking. After longer time BB incubation (12h), this effect was reinforced by PI3K pathway-mediated up-regulation of disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10, an alpha-secretase candidate). Given the strong association between APP metabolism and AD pathogenesis, the ability of BB to regulate APP processing suggests its potential use in AD prevention.

21679929|t|Regional expansion of hypometabolism in Alzheimer's disease follows amyloid deposition with temporal delay.
21679929|a|BACKGROUND: Cross-sectional imaging studies suggest that patterns of hypometabolism (measured by [(18)F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography [FDG-PET]) and amyloid deposition (measured by [(11)C] Pittsburgh Compound B [PiB]- PET) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) show some overlap with each other. This indicates that neuronal dysfunction might spread within the anatomical pattern of amyloid deposition. The aim of this study was to examine longitudinal regional patterns of amyloid deposition and hypometabolism in the same population of mild AD subjects and to establish their regional relationship to each other. METHODS: Twenty patients with mild AD underwent baseline (BL) and follow-up (FU) examination with [(18)F] FDG-PET and [(11)C] PiB-PET. Voxel-by-voxel statistical group comparison (SPM5) was performed between patient BL- and FU-PET data as well as between patients and 15 PiB-negative elderly control subjects, who had undergone identical imaging procedures. To obtain objective measures of regional overlap, Dice similarity coefficients (DSC) between the imaging findings were calculated. RESULTS: Compared with elderly control subjects, AD patients showed typical patterns of BL hypometabolism and BL amyloid deposition, with a similarity of 40% (DSC). Amyloid deposition was more extended than hypometabolism at BL and showed only minor changes over time, whereas significant expansion of hypometabolism was observed, almost exclusively within areas already affected by BL amyloid deposition. Thus, increased similarity of FU hypometabolism with BL amyloid deposition was found (DSC: 47%). CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal regional expansion of cerebral hypometabolism, as a measure of neuronal dysfunction in AD, seems to follow the anatomical pattern of amyloid deposition with temporal delay. This indicates that amyloid-based disruption of neuronal integrity might contribute to the regional expansion of neuronal dysfunction.

21681821|t|Liver-specific overexpression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) in transgenic mice accelerates development of hepatocellular carcinoma.
21681821|a|Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) plays a central role in tumor invasion and development of metastases. Expression of MMP-9 had been shown in human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). However, it remained unclear whether MMP-9 could influence development of HCC. In order to address this issue, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing MMP-9 in the liver. In order to avoid embryonic lethality a Cre-lox system was utilized for conditional overexpression of MMP-9 under control of an albumin enhancer and promoter. Induction of MMP-9 overexpression in transgenic mice was achieved by i.v. injection of an adenovirus coding for the Cre recombinase. Initiation of liver carcinogenesis was achieved by injection of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) followed by Phenobarbital administration in drinking water. Transgene expression was induced at the age of 6 wk. Four and six months later mice were sacrificed and examined macroscopically and microscopically in a blinded manner. Alb/Cre/MMP-9-transgenic mice showed liver specific overexpression of MMP-9-mRNA and protein after induction. At the age of 6 months livers of transgenic mice showed 15.7 +- 11.6 tumors (mean +- SD) in contrast to wildtype mice with only 7.9 +- 11.0 tumors (P < 0.03). By histopathology examination of the livers HCCs were identified in 42% of the transgenic mouse livers but only 8% in wildtype animals. In summary, we established a novel MMP-9 transgenic mouse model, and report on a significantly increased susceptibility of MMP-9 transgenic mice to chemically induced carcinogenesis. This is the first in vivo proof that MMP-9 overexpression promotes liver tumor development.

21682951|t|Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase Pin1 in ageing, cancer and Alzheimer disease.
21682951|a|Phosphorylation of proteins on serine or threonine residues preceding proline is a key signalling mechanism in diverse physiological and pathological processes. Pin1 (peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase) is the only enzyme known that can isomerise specific Ser/Thr-Pro peptide bonds after phosphorylation and regulate their conformational changes with high efficiency. These Pin1-catalysed conformational changes can have profound effects on phosphorylation signalling by regulating a spectrum of target activities. Interestingly, Pin1 deregulation is implicated in a number of diseases, notably ageing and age-related diseases, including cancer and Alzheimer disease. Pin1 is overexpressed in most human cancers; it activates numerous oncogenes or growth enhancers and also inactivates a large number of tumour suppressors or growth inhibitors. By contrast, ablation of Pin1 prevents cancer, but eventually leads to premature ageing and neurodegeneration. Consistent with its neuroprotective role, Pin1 has been shown to be inactivated in neurons of patients with Alzheimer disease. Therefore, Pin1-mediated phosphorylation-dependent prolyl isomerisation represents a unique signalling mechanism that has a pivotal role in the development of human diseases, and might offer an attractive new diagnostic and therapeutic target.

21683126|t|Transmigration of beta amyloid specific heavy chain antibody fragments across the in vitro blood-brain barrier.
21683126|a|Previously selected amyloid beta recognizing heavy chain antibody fragments (VHH) affinity binders derived from the Camelid heavy chain antibody repertoire were tested for their propensity to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) using an established in vitro BBB co-culture system. Of all tested VHH, ni3A showed highest transmigration efficiency which is, in part, facilitated by a three amino acid substitutions in its N-terminal domain. Additional studies indicated that the mechanism of transcellular passage of ni3A is by active transport. As VHH ni3A combines the ability to recognize amyloid beta and to cross the BBB, it has potential as a tool for non-invasive in vivo imaging and as efficient local drug targeting moiety in patients suffering from cerebral amyloidosis such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA).

21683475|t|Different beta-amyloid oligomer assemblies in Alzheimer brains correlate with age of disease onset and impaired cholinergic activity.
21683475|a|In this study, we examined the relationship between various beta-amyloid (Abeta) oligomer assemblies in autopsy brain with the levels of fibrillar Abeta and cholinergic synaptic function. Brain tissues obtained from the frontal cortex of 14 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients grouped into early-onset AD (EOAD) and late-onset AD (LOAD) and 12 age-matched control subjects were used to extract and quantify Abeta oligomers in soluble (TBS), detergent soluble (TBST), and insoluble (GuHCl) fractions. The predominant oligomeric Abeta assemblies detected were dodecamers, decamers, and pentamers, and different patterns of expression were observed between EOAD and LOAD patients. There was no association between any of the detected Abeta oligomer assemblies and fibrillar Abeta levels measured by N-methyl[(3)H] 2-(40-methylaminophenyl)-6-hydroxy-benzothiazole ([(3)H]PIB) binding. Levels of pentamers in the soluble fraction significantly correlated with a reduction in choline acetyltransferase activity in AD patients. The number of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors negatively correlated with the total amount of Abeta oligomers in the insoluble fraction in EOAD patients, and with decamers in the soluble fraction in LOAD patients. These novel findings suggest that distinct Abeta oligomers induce impairment of cholinergic neurotransmission in AD pathogenesis.

21684159|t|Novel quinoxaline derivatives for in vivo imaging of beta-amyloid plaques in the brain.
21684159|a|In a search for new probes to detect beta-amyloid plaques in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), we have synthesized and evaluated a series of quinoxaline derivatives containing a '6+6-6' ring system. These quinoxaline derivatives showed excellent affinity for Abeta(1-42) aggregates with K(i) values ranging from 2.6 to 10.7nM. Autoradiography with sections of brain tissue from an animal model of AD mice (APP/PS1) and AD patients revealed that [(125)I]5 labeled beta-amyloid plaques specifically. In biodistribution experiments using normal mice, [(125)I]5 displayed high uptake (6.03% ID/g at 2min) into and a moderately fast washout from the brain. Although additional refinements are needed to decrease the lipophilicity and improve the washout rate, the quinoxaline scaffold may be useful as a backbone structure to develop novel beta-amyloid imaging agents.

21689771|t|Gami-Chunghyuldan ameliorates memory impairment and neurodegeneration induced by intrahippocampal Abeta 1-42 oligomer injection.
21689771|a|Soluble oligomeric forms of amyloid beta (AbetaO) are regarded as a main cause of synaptic and cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and have been a primary target in the development of drug treatments for AD. The present study utilized a mouse model of AD induced by intrahippocampal injection of AbetaO (10 muM) to investigate the effects of Gami-Chunghyuldan (GCD), a standardized multi-herbal medicinal formula, on the presentation of memory deficits and neurohistological pathogenesis. GCD (10 and 50mg/kg/day, 5 days, p.o.) improved AbetaO-induced memory impairment as well as reduced neuronal cell death, astrogliosis, and microgliosis in the hippocampus. In addition, GCD prevented AbetaO-triggered synaptic disruption and cholinergic fiber loss. These results suggest that GCD may be useful in the prevention and treatment of AD.

21691423|t|Influence of Nanoparticle Size and Shape on Oligomer Formation of an Amyloidogenic Peptide.
21691423|a|Understanding the influence of macromolecular crowding and nanoparticles on the formation of in-register beta-sheets, the primary structural component of amyloid fibrils, is a first step towards describing in vivo protein aggregation and interactions between synthetic materials and proteins. Using all atom molecular simulations in implicit solvent we illustrate the effects of nanoparticle size, shape, and volume fraction on oligomer formation of an amyloidogenic peptide from the transthyretin protein. Surprisingly, we find that inert spherical crowding particles destabilize in-register beta-sheets formed by dimers while stabilizing beta-sheets comprised of trimers and tetramers. As the radius of the nanoparticle increases crowding effects decrease, implying smaller crowding particles have the largest influence on the earliest amyloid species. We explain these results using a theory based on the depletion effect. Finally, we show that spherocylindrical crowders destabilize the ordered beta-sheet dimer to a greater extent than spherical crowders, which underscores the influence of nanoparticle shape on protein aggregation.

21691800|t|Selective interaction of amyloid precursor protein with different isoforms of neural cell adhesion molecule.
21691800|a|Compare to the thoroughly studied beta-amyloid, the physiological function of amyloid precursor protein (APP) is not well understood. We now had identified neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM)-140 as a potential interaction partner of APP. Our data indicated that NCAM-140, but not NCAM-180, binds to the conserved central extracellular domain of APP. We also found that the phosphorylation levels of ERK1 and ERK2 were increased when cells were co-transfected with NCAM-140 and APP indicate that the interaction between NCAM-140 and APP may involve the MAPK pathway. These findings demonstrated that NCAM-140 interacts with APP, potentially playing a role in neurite outgrowth and neural development.

21692120|t|Lipid composition influences the release of Alzheimer's amyloid beta-peptide from membranes.
21692120|a|The behavior of the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) within a membrane environment is integral to its toxicity and the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Ganglioside GM1 has been shown to enhance the aggregation of Abeta, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we explored the interactions between the 40-residue alloform of Abeta (Abeta(40) ) and several model membranes, including pure palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) and palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylserine (POPS), an equimolar mixture of POPC and palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (POPE), and lipid rafts, both with and without GM1, to understand the behavior of Abeta(40) in various membrane microenvironments. Abeta(40) remained inserted in POPC, POPS, POPC/POPE, and raft membranes, but in several instances exited the raft containing GM1. Abeta(40) interacted with GM1 largely through hydrogen bonding, producing configurations containing beta-strands with C-termini that, in some cases, exited the membrane and became exposed to solvent. These observations provide insight into the release of Abeta from the membrane, a previously uncharacterized process of the Abeta aggregation pathway.

21692535|t|New insight into the IR-spectra/structure relationship in amyloid fibrils: a theoretical study on a prion peptide.
21692535|a|Molecular-level structural information on amyloid aggregates is of great importance for the understanding of protein-misfolding-related deseases. Nevertheless, this kind of information is experimentally difficult to obtain. In this work, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with a mixed quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics theoretical methodology, the perturbed matrix method (PMM), in order to study the amide I' IR spectrum of fibrils formed by a short peptide, the H1 peptide, derived from residues 109 through 122 of the Syrian hamster prion protein. The PMM/MD approach allows isolation of the amide I' signal arising from any desired peptide group of the polypeptide chain and quantification of the effect of the excitonic coupling on the frequency position. The calculated single-residue signals were found to be in good agreement with the experimental site-specific spectra obtained by means of isotope-labeled IR spectroscopy, providing a means for their interpretation at the molecular level. In particular, our results confirm the experimental hypothesis that residues ala117 are aligned in all strands and that the alignment gives rise to a red shift of the corresponding site-specific amide I' mode due to strong excitonic coupling among the ala117 peptide groups. In addition, our data show that a red shift of the amide I' band due to strong excitonic coupling can also occur for amino acids adjacent in sequence to the aligned ones. Thus, a red shift of the signal of a given isotope-labeled amino acid does not necessarily imply that the peptide groups under consideration are aligned in the beta-sheet.

21693162|t|Butanol extract of Ecklonia cava prevents production and aggregation of beta-amyloid, and reduces beta-amyloid mediated neuronal death.
21693162|a|Beta-amyloid (Abeta) is a major pathogenic peptide for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is generated by the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). The Abeta monomers aggregate into oligomeric and fibrillar forms which have been implicated as the toxic species inducing the neuronal dysfunction. Brown algae Ecklonia cava is known for its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory functions. Therefore, we tested the effect of E. cava extract on the production and aggregation of Abeta peptides. The butanol extract of E. cava reduced Abeta secretion from HEK293 cells expressing APP with Swedish mutation and increased soluble APPalpha and C-terminal fragment-alpha (CTFalpha), of which activity was similar to BACE (beta-site of APP cleaving enzyme) inhibitors. Furthermore, the extract inhibited Abeta oligomerization, particularly mid-size oligomer formation, confirmed by the ultrastructural morphology. Congo red, thioflavin T assays, and electron microscopy showed that the extract inhibited Abeta fibril formation effectively. Finally, the extract protected primary cortical neurons from various Abeta-induced cell deaths, especially oligomer-induced death. Although further study is needed to test the effectiveness of the extract in vivo, our results demonstrate, for the first time, that the butanol extract of E. cava could be used as an anti-Abeta agent for AD therapeutics.

21694447|t|The dynamics of CD147 in Alzheimer's disease development and pathology.
21694447|a|CD147, also known as basigin, EMMPRIN, neurothelin, TCSF, M6, HT7, OX47, or gp42, is a transmembrane glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin super-family. It is expressed in many neuronal and non-neuronal tissues including the hippocampus, pre-frontal cortex thyroid, heart, early erythroid, amygdala, and placenta. This protein is involved in various cellular and biological functions, such as lymphocyte migration and maturation, tissue repair cancer progression, T and B lymphocyte activation, and induction of extracellular matrix metalloproteinase. The CD147 protein interacts with other proteins such as cyclophilin A (CyPA), Cyclophilin B (CyPB), sterol carrier protein (SCP), caveolin-1 and integrins, and can influence amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide levels, a protein that is central to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Mechanisms by which CD147 regulate Abeta levels remain unclear, thus in this review we discuss its involvement in Abeta production and clearance and potential mechanisms by which controlling CD147 levels could impact on Abeta accumulation and AD pathogenesis.

21694457|t|Caspase-12 activation is involved in amyloid-beta protein-induced synaptic toxicity.
21694457|a|Synapse loss is considered to be the best correlate of cognitive impairments in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and growing evidence supports the notion that certain events that trigger neuronal death in AD can be initiated by the local activation of caspases within the synaptic compartment. We have demonstrated previously that presynaptic terminals are particularly vulnerable to endoplasmic-reticulum (ER)-stress depending of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta). This toxicity included a notable reduction of actin and synaptophysin protein and mitochondrial dysfunction. This synaptic damage was prevented by incubation with a wide range of caspase inhibitor, suggesting the activation of local synaptic apoptotic mechanisms. The ER-resident caspase-12 was initially identified as a mediator of Abeta neurotoxicity. Thus, the current study was conducted to explore the presence and local activation of the caspase-12 in cortical and hippocampal synaptosomes isolated from rat and from the triple transgenic mouse model of AD (3xTg-AD) in the presence of Abeta and ryanodine. Under these conditions, we found mitochondrial failure accompanied by a reduction in actin levels which was dependent on caspase-12 activation suggesting its participation in Abeta-induced synaptic toxicity.

21694460|t|Detection of amyloid-beta protein precursor homo-interactions using beta-galactosidase enzyme fragment complementation.
21694460|a|Amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) produces amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta), the major constituent of amyloid plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Experimental evidence suggests that increased dimerization of AbetaPP increases Abeta while decreased dimerization of AbetaPP decreases Abeta production. If true, developing tools for detecting AbetaPP-AbetaPP interactions to understand AbetaPP processing leading to Abeta production would be important. Here, we developed the method of beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) enzyme fragment complementation as a means to detect AbetaPP-AbetaPP interactions. Inactive beta-gal fragments are independently tagged to the C-terminal ends of monomeric AbetaPPs, and will come together to form a functional enzyme upon AbetaPP-AbetaPP interactions. Successful detection of beta-gal activity has been used to qualitatively visualize and quantify the amount of AbetaPP dimers or higher oligomers. This method can be used to enhance our understanding of the biological processes dependent upon AbetaPP-AbetaPP interactions.

21694462|t|Green tea epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and other flavonoids reduce Alzheimer's amyloid-induced mitochondrial dysfunction.
21694462|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction may play a role in the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, therapeutics targeted to improve mitochondrial function could be beneficial. Plant-derived flavonoids have shown promise in improving certain AD phenotypes, but the overall mechanism of action(s) through which flavonoids protect from AD is still unknown. To identify flavonoids and other natural products that may correct amyloid-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, 25 natural products were screened for their ability to restore altered mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, or ATP levels in neuroblastoma cells expressing mutant amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP). Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and luteolin were identified as the top two mitochondrial restorative compounds from the in vitro screen. EGCG was further tested in vivo to determine its effects on brain mitochondrial function in an AbetaPP/PS-1 (presenilin 1) double mutant transgenic mouse model of AD. EGCG treatment restored mitochondrial respiratory rates, MMP, ROS production, and ATP levels by 50 to 85% in mitochondria isolated from the hippocampus, cortex, and striatum. The results of this study lend further credence to the notion that EGCG and other flavonoids, such as luteolin, are 'multipotent therapeutic agents' that not only reduce toxic levels of brain Abeta, but also hold the potential to protect neuronal mitochondrial function in AD.

21694463|t|Investigation of matrix metalloproteinases, MMP-2 and MMP-9, in plasma reveals a decrease of MMP-2 in Alzheimer's disease.
21694463|a|Pathological changes in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain include amyoid-beta (Abeta) plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles, as well as neuronal death and synaptic loss. Matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 are known to degrade Abeta, and their expressions are increased in the AD brain, in particular in the astrocytes surrounding amyloid plaque. To investigate a possible association between plasma metalloproteinases and AD, we quantified MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities in the plasma of healthy controls (HC, n = 56), cases with mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 45), and AD (n = 50). All cases had previously been imaged with Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) and had a Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) assessment. MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity was determined using gelatine-zymography. There was a significant 1.5-fold decrease in MMP-2 activity in the AD group compared to HC (p < 0.001) and a 1.4-fold decrease compared to MCI (p < 0.01). There was no difference in MMP-9 levels between the three groups. A positive correlation was identified between MMP-2 plasma activity and MMSE score (r = 0.16, p < 0.05), but there was no association with PiB. This is the first report of a change in MMP-2 activity in AD plasma and these findings may provide some insight into AD pathogenesis.

21696834|t|Neuroimaging markers for the prediction and early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia.
21696834|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive age-related neurodegenerative disease. At the time of clinical manifestation of dementia, significant irreversible brain damage is already present, rendering the diagnosis of AD at early stages of the disease an urgent prerequisite for therapeutic treatment to halt, or at least slow, disease progression. In this review, we discuss various neuroimaging measures that are proving to have potential value as biomarkers of AD pathology for the detection and prediction of AD before the onset of dementia. Recent studies that have identified AD-like structural and functional brain changes in elderly people who are cognitively within the normal range or who have mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are discussed. A dynamic sequence model of changes that occur in neuroimaging markers during the different disease stages is presented and the predictive value of multimodal neuroimaging for AD dementia is considered.

21697382|t|The second-generation active Abeta immunotherapy CAD106 reduces amyloid accumulation in APP transgenic mice while minimizing potential side effects.
21697382|a|Immunization against amyloid-beta (Abeta) can reduce amyloid accumulation in vivo and is considered a potential therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease. However, it has been associated with meningoencephalitis thought to be mediated by inflammatory T-cells. With the aim of producing an immunogenic vaccine without this side effect, we designed CAD106 comprising Abeta1-6 coupled to the virus-like particle Qbeta. Immunization with this vaccine did not activate Abeta-specific T-cells. In APP transgenic mice, CAD106 induced efficacious Abeta antibody titers of different IgG subclasses mainly recognizing the Abeta3-6 epitope. CAD106 reduced brain amyloid accumulation in two APP transgenic mouse lines. Plaque number was a more sensitive readout than plaque area, followed by Abeta42 and Abeta40 levels. Studies with very strong overall amyloid reduction showed an increase in vascular Abeta, which atypically was nonfibrillar. The efficacy of Abeta immunotherapy depended on the Abeta levels and thus differed between animal models, brain regions, and stage of amyloid deposition. Therefore, animal studies may not quantitatively predict the effect in human Alzheimer's disease. Our studies provided no evidence for increased microhemorrhages or inflammatory reactions in amyloid-containing brain. In rhesus monkeys, CAD106 induced a similar antibody response as in mice. The antibodies stained amyloid deposits on tissue sections of mouse and human brain but did not label cellular structures containing APP. They reacted with Abeta monomers and oligomers and blocked Abeta toxicity in cell culture. We conclude that CAD106 immunization is suited to interfere with Abeta aggregation and its downstream detrimental effects.

21698718|t|Studies of the growth, evolution, and self-aggregation of beta-amyloid fibrils using tapping-mode atomic force microscopy.
21698718|a|Amyloid peptide (Abeta) is the major protein component of plaques found in Alzheimer's disease, and the aggregation of Abeta into oligomeric and fibrillic assemblies has been shown to be an early event of the disease pathway. Visualization of the progressive evolution of nanoscale changes in the morphology of Abeta oligomeric assemblies and amyloid fibrils has been accomplished ex situ using atomic force microscopy (AFM) in ambient conditions. In this report, the size and the shape of amyloid beta(1-40) fibrils, as well as the secondary organization into aggregate structures were monitored at different intervals over a period of 5 months. Characterizations with tapping-mode AFM serve to minimize the strong adhesive forces between the probe and the sample to prevent damage or displacement of fragile fibrils. The early stages of Abeta growth showed a predominance of spherical seed structures, oligomeric assemblies, and protofibrils; however the size and density of fibrils progressively increased with time. Within a few days of incubation, linear assemblies and fibrils became apparent. Over extended time scales of up to 5 months, the fibrils formed dense ensembles spanning lengths of several microns, which exhibit interesting changes due to self-organization of the fibrils into bundles or tangles. Detailed characterization of the Abeta assembly process at the nanoscale will help elucidate the role of Abeta in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease.

21699461|t|Association of beta-amyloid peptide fragments with neuronal nitric oxide synthase: Implications in the etiology of Alzheimers disease.

After extended incubation of nNOS (96 h) with each of the peptide fragments, Congo Red, turbidity and thioflavin-T assays detected the presence of soluble and insoluble fibrils that had formed at a rate of 5 nM.min(-1). A hydrophobic fragment Abeta(17-21) [Leu(17) - Val(18) - Phe(19) - Phe(20) - Ala(21)] and glycine zipper motifs within the peptide fragment Abeta(17-35) were critical in binding and in fibrillogenesis confirming that nNOS was amyloidogenic catalyst.

21699541|t|N-cadherin enhances APP dimerization at the extracellular domain and modulates Abeta production.
21699541|a|Sequential processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretase leads to the generation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides, which plays a central role in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. APP is capable of forming a homodimer through its extracellular domain as well as transmembrane GXXXG motifs. A number of reports have shown that dimerization of APP modulates Abeta production. On the other hand, we have previously reported that N-cadherin-based synaptic contact is tightly linked to Abeta production. In the present report, we investigated the effect of N-cadherin expression on APP dimerization and metabolism. Here, we demonstrate that N-cadherin expression facilitates cis-dimerization of APP. Moreover, N-cadherin expression led to increased production of Abeta as well as soluble APPbeta, indicating that beta-secretase-mediated cleavage of APP is enhanced. Interestingly, N-cadherin expression affected neither dimerization of C99 nor Abeta production from C99, suggesting that the effect of N-cadherin on APP metabolism is mediated through APP extracellular domain. We confirmed that N-cadherin enhances APP dimerization by a novel luciferase-complementation assay, which could be a platform for drug screening on a high-throughput basis. Taken together, our results suggest that modulation of APP dimerization state could be one of mechanisms, which links synaptic contact and Abeta production.

21699726|t|Prevention of the beta-amyloid peptide-induced inflammatory process by inhibition of double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase in primary murine mixed co-cultures.
21699726|a|BACKGROUND: Inflammation may be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). There has been little success with anti-inflammatory drugs in AD, while the promise of anti-inflammatory treatment is more evident in experimental models. A new anti-inflammatory strategy requires a better understanding of molecular mechanisms. Among the plethora of signaling pathways activated by beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides, the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathway could be an interesting target. In virus-infected cells, double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) controls the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. It is well-known that PKR is activated in AD. This led us to study the effect of a specific inhibitor of PKR on the Abeta42-induced inflammatory response in primary mixed murine co-cultures, allowing interactions between neurons, astrocytes and microglia. METHODS: Primary mixed murine co-cultures were prepared in three steps: a primary culture of astrocytes and microglia for 14 days, then a primary culture of neurons and astrocytes which were cultured with microglia purified from the first culture. Before exposure to Abeta neurotoxicity (72 h), co-cultures were treated with compound C16, a specific inhibitor of PKR. Levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), interleukin (IL)-1beta, and IL-6 were assessed by ELISA. Levels of PT451-PKR and activation of IkappaB, NF-kappaB and caspase-3 were assessed by western blotting. Apoptosis was also followed using annexin V-FITC immunostaining kit. Subcellular distribution of PT451-PKR was assessed by confocal immunofluorescence and morphological structure of cells by scanning electron microscopy. Data were analysed using one-way ANOVA followed by a Newman-Keuls' post hoc test RESULTS: In these co-cultures, PKR inhibition prevented Abeta42-induced activation of IkappaB and NF-kappaB, strongly decreased production and release of tumor necrosis factor (TNFalpha) and interleukin (IL)-1beta, and limited apoptosis. CONCLUSION: In spite of the complexity of the innate immune response, PKR inhibition could be an interesting anti-inflammatory strategy in AD.

Intrahippocampal injection of Abeta(1-40) induced spatial memory and learning decline in rats. Proteomic analysis revealed the changes in protein expression in the rat hippocampus treated with Abeta(1-40). Four proteins of interest which was in abundance was significantly altered in Abeta(1-40)-treated rats were identified by peptide mass fingerprint (PMF). These proteins corresponded to synapsin Ib, protein disulfide-isomerase A3 precursor, tubulin beta chain and ATP synthase beta subunit. Our results provide new insights into the relationship between Abeta and the pathogenesis of AD, and suggest potential targets for the therapy of AD.

21700581|t|Early detection of Alzheimer disease: 11C-PiB PET in twins discordant for cognitive impairment.
21700581|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether cognitively preserved monozygotic or dizygotic cotwins of persons with Alzheimer disease (AD) exhibit increased brain amyloid accumulation. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional carbon-11 labeled 2-(4'-methylaminophenyl)-6-hydroxybenzothiazole ((11)C)-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET study on 9 monozygotic and 8 dizygotic twin pairs discordant for cognitive impairment as well as on 9 healthy elderly control subjects. (11)C-PiB uptake was analyzed with Statistical Parametric Mapping and with region of interest analysis with the region-to-cerebellum ratio as a measure of tracer uptake. RESULTS: Cognitively preserved monozygotic cotwins of cognitively impaired probands had increased cortical (11)C-PiB uptake (117%-121% of control mean) in their temporal and parietal cortices and the posterior cingulate. Cognitively preserved dizygotic subjects did not differ from the controls. Further, the cognitively preserved monozygotic subjects showed similar (11)C-PiB uptake patterns as their cognitively impaired cotwins. The cognitively impaired subjects (monozygotic and dizygotic individuals combined) showed typical Alzheimer-like patterns of (11)C-PiB uptake. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic factors appear to influence the development of Alzheimer-like beta-amyloid plaque pathology. The dissociation between cognitive impairment and brain beta-amyloidosis in monozygotic twins implies that there may be important environmental/acquired factors that modulate the relationship between brain amyloidosis and neurodegeneration. AD may be detectable in high-risk individuals in its presymptomatic stage with (11)C-PiB PET, but clinical follow-up will be needed to confirm this.

21700583|t|Precuneus amyloid burden is associated with reduced cholinergic activity in Alzheimer disease.
21700583|a|OBJECTIVE: This study examined the relationship between postmortem precuneus cholinergic enzyme activity, Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) binding, and soluble amyloid-beta concentration in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer disease (AD). METHODS: Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity, [(3)H]PiB binding, and soluble amyloid-beta(1-42) (Abeta42) concentration were quantified in precuneus tissue samples harvested postmortem from subjects with no cognitive impairment (NCI), MCI, and mild AD and correlated with their last antemortem Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score and postmortem pathologic evaluation according to the National Institute on Aging-Reagan criteria, recommendations of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease, and Braak stage. RESULTS: Precuneus ChAT activity was lower in AD than in NCI and was comparable between MCI and NCI. Precuneus [(3)H]PiB binding and soluble Abeta42 levels were elevated in MCI and significantly higher in AD than in NCI. Across all case subjects, reduced ChAT activity was associated with increased [(3)H]PiB binding, increased soluble Abeta42, lower MMSE score, presence of the APOE*4 allele, and more advanced AD pathology. CONCLUSIONS: Despite accumulating amyloid burden, cholinergic enzyme activity is stable in the precuneus during prodromal AD. A decline in precuneus ChAT activity occurs only in clinical AD, when PiB binding and soluble Abeta42 levels are substantially elevated compared with those in MCI. Anti-amyloid interventions in MCI case subjects with a positive PiB PET scan may aid in reducing cholinergic deficits and cognitive decline later in the disease process.

21704433|t|Amyloid beta-induced ER stress is enhanced under mitochondrial dysfunction conditions.
21704433|a|Previously we reported that endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria crosstalk is involved in amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced apoptosis. Now we show that mitochondrial dysfunction affects the ER stress response triggered by Abeta using cybrids that recreate the defect in mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity detected in platelets from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. AD and control cybrids were treated with Abeta or classical ER stressors and the ER stress-mediated apoptotic cell death pathway was accessed. Upon treatment, we found increased glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) levels and caspase-4 activation (ER stress markers) which were more pronounced in AD cybrids. Treated AD cybrids also exhibited decreased cell survival as well as increased caspase-3-like activity, poli-ADP-ribose-polymerase (PARP) levels and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive apoptotic cells. Finally, we showed that Abeta-induced caspase-3 activation in both cybrid cell lines was prevented by dantrolene, thus implicating ER Ca(2+) release in ER stress-mediated apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction occurring in AD patients due to COX inhibition potentiates cell susceptibility to Abeta-induced ER stress. This study further supports the close communication between ER and mitochondria during apoptosis in AD.

21706234|t|Protective effects of walnut extract against amyloid beta peptide-induced cell death and oxidative stress in PC12 cells.
21706234|a|Amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) is the major component of senile plaques and cerebrovascular amyloid deposits in individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Abeta is known to increase free radical production in neuronal cells, leading to oxidative stress and cell death. Recently, considerable attention has been focused on dietary antioxidants that are able to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby offering protection against oxidative stress. Walnuts are rich in components that have anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The inhibition of in vitro fibrillization of synthetic Abeta, and solubilization of preformed fibrillar Abeta by walnut extract was previously reported. The present study was designed to investigate whether walnut extract can protect against Abeta-induced oxidative damage and cytotoxicity. The effect of walnut extract on Abeta-induced cellular damage, ROS generation and apoptosis in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells was studied. Walnut extract reduced Abeta-mediated cell death assessed by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) reduction, and release of lactate dehydrogenase (membrane damage), DNA damage (apoptosis) and generation of ROS in a concentration-dependent manner. These results suggest that walnut extract can counteract Abeta-induced oxidative stress and associated cell death.

21707077|t|From fragment screening to in vivo efficacy: optimization of a series of 2-aminoquinolines as potent inhibitors of beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1).
21707077|a|Using fragment-based screening of a focused fragment library, 2-aminoquinoline 1 was identified as an initial hit for BACE1. Further SAR development was supported by X-ray structures of BACE1 cocrystallized with various ligands and molecular modeling studies to expedite the discovery of potent compounds. These strategies enabled us to integrate the C-3 side chain on 2-aminoquinoline 1 extending deep into the P2' binding pocket of BACE1 and enhancing the ligand's potency. We were able to improve the BACE1 potency to subnanomolar range, over 10(6)-fold more potent than the initial hit (900 muM). Further elaboration of the physical properties of the lead compounds to those more consistent with good blood-brain barrier permeability led to inhibitors with greatly improved cellular activity and permeability. Compound 59 showed an IC(50) value of 11 nM on BACE1 and cellular activity of 80 nM. This compound was advanced into rat pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies and demonstrated significant reduction of Abeta levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

21708076|t|The protective effects of coumestrol against amyloid-beta peptide- and lipopolysaccharide-induced toxicity on mice astrocytes.
21708076|a|OBJECTIVES: Estrogen replacement therapy can decrease the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Phytoestrogens have been proposed as potential alternatives to estrogen replacement therapy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vitro protective effects of coumestrol on mice astrocytes. METHODS: Different concentrations of coumestrol were tested for their protective efficacy against two toxic insults, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and amyloid-beta peptide, on astrocytes. The mitochondrial activity of astrocytes was determined, and the protective efficacy and pathway were examined by their specific gene expression and protein change. RESULTS: The results showed that coumestrol induced a modest but significant increase in viability of astrocytes, while the viability of astrocytes was reduced following exposure to LPS and amyloid-beta peptide. The addition of coumestrol could reverse the toxic effect induced by LPS and amyloid-beta peptide. Both the LPS and amyloid-beta peptide enhanced interleukin 1, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha synthesis and these effects were inhibited by 10(-9)M coumestrol. This effect was more obvious on the LPS-induced inflammation. The estrogen receptor expression was upregulated by coumestrol, while the effect was more obvious on estrogen receptor-beta (ER-beta). These effects can be inhibited by extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase inhibitors but not p38 inhibitor. DISCUSSION: The current data support a possible role for astrocytes in the mediation of neuroprotection by coumestrol. An indirect extracellular signal-regulated kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway to downregulate the expression of interleukin 1, interleukin 6, and the tumor necrosis factor-alpha cytotoxic effect may act in concert with the proposed direct ER-beta biosynethsis pathway to achieve a widespread, global protection of ER-beta positive neurons.

21709248|t|Altered temporal patterns of anxiety in aged and amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice.
21709248|a|Both normal aging and dementia are associated with dysregulation of the biological clock, which contributes to disrupted circadian organization of physiology and behavior. Diminished circadian organization in conjunction with the loss of cholinergic input to the cortex likely contributes to impaired cognition and behavior. One especially notable and relatively common circadian disturbance among the aged is "sundowning syndrome," which is characterized by exacerbated anxiety, agitation, locomotor activity, and delirium during the hours before bedtime. Sundowning has been reported in both dementia patients and cognitively intact elderly individuals living in institutions; however, little is known about temporal patterns in anxiety and agitation, and the neurobiological basis of these rhythms remains unspecified. In the present study, we explored the diurnal pattern of anxiety-like behavior in aged and amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice. We then attempted to treat the observed behavioral disturbances in the aged mice using chronic nightly melatonin treatment. Finally, we tested the hypothesis that time-of-day differences in acetylcholinesterase and choline acetyltransferase expression and general neuronal activation (i.e., c-Fos expression) coincide with the behavioral symptoms. Our results show a temporal pattern of anxiety-like behavior that emerges in elderly mice. This behavioral pattern coincides with elevated locomotor activity relative to adult mice near the end of the dark phase, and with time-dependent changes in basal forebrain acetylcholinesterase expression. Transgenic APP mice show a similar behavioral phenomenon that is not observed among age-matched wild-type mice. These results may have useful applications to the study and treatment of age- and dementia-related circadian behavioral disturbances, namely, sundowning syndrome.

21709378|t|Meta-analysis of plasma amyloid-beta levels in Alzheimer's disease.
21709378|a|Plasma amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels have been proposed as biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but studies have produced inconsistent results. We present a meta-analytic review of cross-sectional studies that examined plasma Abeta levels in AD and cognitively normal subjects, and longitudinal studies that used baseline plasma Abeta levels to predict conversion from normal cognition to AD. Medline and EMBASE databases were searched to generate an initial list of relevant studies, and selected authors approached for additional data. Twelve cross- sectional studies (n = 1483) and seven longitudinal (n = 3920) met the inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. Random effects model was used to calculate the weighted mean difference (WMD) by Review Manager Version 4.2. In longitudinal studies, cognitively normal individuals who converted to AD had higher baseline Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 levels (WMD: 10.29, z = 3.80, p = 0.0001 and WMD: 8.01, z = 2.76, p = 0.006, respectively), and non-significantly increased Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 ratio (WMD: 0.03, z = 1.65, p = 0.10). In cross sectional studies, compared to cognitively normal individuals, AD patients had marginally but non-significantly lower Abeta1-42 levels (WMD:-2.84, z = 1.73, p = 0.08), but Abeta1-40 levels were not significantly different (WMD: 3.43, z = 0.40, p = 0.69). Our systematic review suggests a model of differential longitudinal changes in plasma Abeta levels in cognitively stable individuals versus those who go on to develop AD dementia. Baseline Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 levels in cognitively normal elderly individuals might be predictors of higher rates of progression to AD, and should be further explored as potential biomarkers.

21712440|t|Site-specific characterization of threonine, serine, and tyrosine glycosylations of amyloid precursor protein/amyloid beta-peptides in human cerebrospinal fluid.
21712440|a|The proteolytic processing of human amyloid precursor protein (APP) into shorter aggregating amyloid beta (Abeta)-peptides, e.g., Abeta1-42, is considered a critical step in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although APP is a well-known membrane glycoprotein carrying both N- and O-glycans, nothing is known about the occurrence of released APP/Abeta glycopeptides in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We used the 6E10 antibody and immunopurified Abeta peptides and glycopeptides from CSF samples and then liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for structural analysis using collision-induced dissociation and electron capture dissociation. In addition to 33 unglycosylated APP/Abeta peptides, we identified 37 APP/Abeta glycopeptides with sialylated core 1 like O-glycans attached to Thr(-39, -21, -20, and -13), in a series of APP/AbetaX-15 glycopeptides, where X was -63, -57, -52, and -45, in relation to Asp1 of the Abeta sequence. Unexpectedly, we also identified a series of 27 glycopeptides, the Abeta1-X series, where X was 20 (DAEFRHDSGYEVHHQKLVFF), 19, 18, 17, 16, and 15, which were all uniquely glycosylated on Tyr10. The Tyr10 linked O-glycans were (Neu5Ac)(1-2)Hex(Neu5Ac)HexNAc-O- structures with the disialylated terminals occasionally O-acetylated or lactonized, indicating a terminal Neu5Acalpha2,8Neu5Ac linkage. We could not detect any glycosylation of the Abeta1-38/40/42 isoforms. We observed an increase of up to 2.5 times of Tyr10 glycosylated Abeta peptides in CSF in six AD patients compared to seven non-AD patients. APP/Abeta sialylated O-glycans, including that of a Tyr residue, the first in a mammalian protein, may modulate APP processing, inhibiting the amyloidogenic pathway associated with AD.

21712514|t|Beta amyloid deposition and neurofibrillary tangles spontaneously occur in the brains of captive cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus).
21712514|a|Alzheimer disease is a dementing disorder characterized pathologically by Abeta deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal loss. Although aged animals of many species spontaneously develop Abeta deposits, only 2 species (chimpanzee and wolverine) have been reported to develop Abeta deposits and neurofibrillary tangles in the same individual. Here, the authors demonstrate the spontaneous occurrence of Abeta deposits and neurofibrillary tangles in captive cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus). Among 22 cheetahs examined in this study, Abeta deposits were observed in 13. Immunostaining (AT8) revealed abnormal intracellular tau immunoreactivity in 10 of the cheetahs with Abeta deposits, and they were mainly distributed in the parahippocampal cortex and CA1 in a fashion similar to that in human patients with Alzheimer disease. Ultrastructurally, bundles of straight filaments filled the neuronal somata and axons, consistent with tangles. Interestingly, 2 of the cheetahs with the most severe abnormal tau immunoreactivity showed clinical cognitive dysfunction. The authors conclude that cheetahs spontaneously develop age-related neurodegenerative disease with pathologic changes similar to Alzheimer disease.

21714827|t|Widespread tau and amyloid-beta pathology many years after a single traumatic brain injury in humans.
21714827|a|While a history of a single traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with the later development of syndromes of cognitive impairment such as Alzheimer's disease, the long-term pathology evolving after single TBI is poorly understood. However, a progressive tauopathy, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, is described in selected cohorts with a history of repetitive concussive/mild head injury. Here, post-mortem brains from long-term survivors of just a single TBI (1-47 years survival; n=39) vs. uninjured, age-matched controls (n=47) were examined for neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques using immunohistochemistry and thioflavine-S staining. Detailed maps of findings permitted classification of pathology using semiquantitative scoring systems. NFTs were exceptionally rare in young, uninjured controls, yet were abundant and widely distributed in approximately one-third of TBI cases. In addition, Abeta-plaques were found in a greater density following TBI vs. controls. Moreover, thioflavine-S staining revealed that while all plaque-positive control cases displayed predominantly diffuse plaques, 64% of plaque-positive TBI cases displayed predominantly thioflavine-S-positive plaques or a mixed thioflavine-S-positive/diffuse pattern. These data demonstrate that widespread NFT and Abeta plaque pathologies are present in up to a third of patients following survival of a year or more from a single TBI. This suggests that a single TBI induces long-term neuropathological changes akin to those found in neurodegenerative disease.

21715616|t|Controlled cortical impact traumatic brain injury in 3xTg-AD mice causes acute intra-axonal amyloid-beta accumulation and independently accelerates the development of tau abnormalities.
21715616|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized pathologically by progressive neuronal loss, extracellular plaques containing the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides, and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. Abeta is thought to act upstream of tau, affecting its phosphorylation and therefore aggregation state. One of the major risk factors for AD is traumatic brain injury (TBI). Acute intra-axonal Abeta and diffuse extracellular plaques occur in ~30% of human subjects after severe TBI. Intra-axonal accumulations of tau but not tangle-like pathologies have also been found in these patients. Whether and how these acute accumulations contribute to subsequent AD development is not known, and the interaction between Abeta and tau in the setting of TBI has not been investigated. Here, we report that controlled cortical impact TBI in 3xTg-AD mice resulted in intra-axonal Abeta accumulations and increased phospho-tau immunoreactivity at 24 h and up to 7 d after TBI. Given these findings, we investigated the relationship between Abeta and tau pathologies after trauma in this model by systemic treatment of Compound E to inhibit gamma-secretase activity, a proteolytic process required for Abeta production. Compound E treatment successfully blocked posttraumatic Abeta accumulation in these injured mice at both time points. However, tau pathology was not affected. Our data support a causal role for TBI in acceleration of AD-related pathologies and suggest that TBI may independently affect Abeta and tau abnormalities. Future studies will be required to assess the behavioral and long-term neurodegenerative consequences of these pathologies.

21715709|t|Plasma Abeta and PET PiB binding are inversely related in mild cognitive impairment.
21715709|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relations between PET Pittsburgh compound B (PiB-PET) binding (amyloid imaging) and plasma Abeta in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and similarly aged controls. METHODS: In 20 patients with MCI and 19 cognitively intact controls (case-control study), PiB binding potential (BP(nd)) was assessed in 4 regions, and total brain excluding cerebellum, referenced to cerebellar binding. The mean of plasma Abeta levels measured in duplicate was analyzed. RESULTS: Plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio was decreased in MCI compared to controls (mean 0.15 SD 0.04 vs mean 0.19 SD 0.07, p = 0.03) but Abeta40 (p = 0.3) and Abeta42 (p = 0.06) levels did not differ between the 2 groups. PiB BP(nd) was increased in MCI compared to controls in the cingulate (p = 0.02), parietal (p = 0.02), and total brain (p = 0.03), but not in prefrontal cortex (p = 0.08) or parahippocampal gyrus (p = 0.07). Linear regression analyses adjusting for age, sex, and cognitive test scores showed that low Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio was associated with high cingulate, parietal, and total brain PiB binding (0.01< p <= 0.05). These associations between PiB binding and the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio were strongest in PiB-positive subjects and within the MCI group. CONCLUSIONS: Though cross-sectional, the findings support the "sink" hypothesis that increased brain Abeta is accompanied by lower peripheral levels of Abeta, particularly the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio in patients with MCI. The association between PiB binding and the plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio suggests possible use of plasma Abeta combined with PiB binding as a risk biomarker with potential clinical application.

21717587|t|Development and expression of amyloid-beta peptide 42 in retinal ganglion cells in rats.
21717587|a|The previous studies have shown that amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) was mainly found in neurons of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and glaucoma and little is known about its expression in normal nerve cells. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of amyloid-beta peptide 42 (Abeta-42) in retinal ganglion cells of the postnatal rats. Rats were divided into seven experimental groups: 3, 6, 13, 15, 25, 60, and 90 days postnatal groups. Rats from 15 and 25 days postnatal groups were further divided into light-exposure and non light-exposure group. Cryosections or flat-mounted retinas of rat eyes were used for testing Abeta-42 by immunocytochemistry staining. Abeta-42 expression was not observed in rats within 13 days after birth, but was easily detectable in all groups of rats over 15 days after birth. In addition, the expression of Abeta-42 in retina was increasing as the rats got older, reached to highest level in 60 days after birth. Furthermore, the expression of Abeta-42 was not detected in rats kept under dark indicating that light is required for the expression of Abeta-42 in retina. This is the first report showing that normal retinal ganglion cells express Abeta-42, and that the expression of Abeta-42 in retinal ganglion cells requires the exposure to light. These data suggest that Abeta-42 may play a important role in vision development.

21718030|t|Exploring the reactions of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide 1-28 with Al(III) and Fe(III) ions.
21718030|a|The reactions of human beta-amyloid peptide 1-28 (Abeta28) with Al(III) and Fe(III) ions were investigated by (1)H NMR and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) under pH conditions close to physiological ones. (1)H NMR titrations, performed in the 5.3-8.0 pH range, revealed that no measurable amounts of Abeta28-Al(III) or Abeta28-Fe(III) adducts are formed; such metal adducts could not be obtained even by changing a number of experimental conditions, e.g., temperature, buffer, nature of the salt, etc. These observations were later confirmed by ESI-MS. It is thus demonstrated that Abeta28, at physiological pH, is not able to form binary complexes with Al(III) and Fe(III) ions of sufficient stability to compete with metal hydroxide precipitation. The biological implications of these findings are discussed in the frame of current literature.

21720722|t|Target gene repression mediated by miRNAs miR-181c and miR-9 both of which are down-regulated by amyloid-beta.
21720722|a|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA regulators of protein synthesis that are essential for normal brain development and function. Their profiles are significantly altered in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) that is characterized by amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau deposition in brain. How deregulated miRNAs contribute to AD is not understood, as their dysfunction could be both a cause and a consequence of disease. To address this question we had previously profiled miRNAs in models of AD. This identified miR-9 and -181c as being down-regulated by Abeta in hippocampal cultures. Interestingly, there was a remarkable overlap with those miRNAs that are deregulated in Abeta-depositing APP23 transgenic mice and in human AD tissue. While the Abeta precursor protein APP itself is a target of miRNA regulation, the challenge resides in identifying further targets. Here, we expand the repertoire of miRNA target genes by identifying the 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) of TGFBI, TRIM2, SIRT1 and BTBD3 as being repressed by miR-9 and -181c, either alone or in combination. Taken together, our study identifies putative target genes of miRNAs miR-9 and 181c, which may function in brain homeostasis and disease pathogenesis.

21721557|t|Single molecule tracking analysis reveals that the surface mobility of amyloid oligomers is driven by their conformational structure.
21721557|a|Several models have been proposed to explain the cytotoxicity of Abeta oligomers. The structural polymorphism of the oligomers can account for the various toxic effects observed. By combining the use of conformation-specific antibodies and single particle tracking techniques, we have investigated the mobility of individual Abeta1-42 oligomers on the plasma membrane of living cells. Distinct structural types of Abeta1-42 oligomers were labeled with two different conformation-specific antibodies. While both types of oligomers showed a heterogeneous dynamic behavior, their overall mobility was found to be significantly different. Conversely, we discovered that other amyloid oligomers sharing a similar conformation but composed of different peptides (amylin and prion Sup35NM) display dynamic behaviors comparable to those found for Abeta1-42 oligomers. This study provides evidence for a link between the quaternary structure and the membrane mobility of proteins, revealing that structurally analogous supramolecular assemblies diffuse similarly in cells.

21722314|t|Membrane and surface interactions of Alzheimer's Abeta peptide--insights into the mechanism of cytotoxicity.
21722314|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia and its pathological hallmarks include the loss of neurones through cell death, as well as the accumulation of amyloid fibres in the form of extracellular neuritic plaques. Amyloid fibrils are composed of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), which is known to assemble to form 'toxic' oligomers that may be central to disease pathology. Abeta is produced by cleavage from the amyloid precursor protein within the transmembrane region, and the cleaved peptide may retain some membrane affinity. It has been shown that Abeta is capable of specifically binding to phospholipid membranes with a relatively high affinity, and that modulation of the composition of the membrane can alter both membrane-amyloid interactions and toxicity. Various biomimetic membrane models have been used (e.g. lipid vesicles in solution and tethered lipid bilayers) to examine the binding and interactions between Abeta and the membrane surfaces, as well as the resulting permeation. Oligomeric Abeta has been observed to bind more avidly to membranes and cause greater permeation than fibrillar Abeta. We review some of the recent advances in studying Abeta-membrane interactions and discuss their implications with respect to understanding the causes of Alzheimer's disease.

21723301|t|A novel canonical dual computational approach for prion AGAAAAGA amyloid fibril molecular modeling.
21723301|a|Many experimental studies have shown that the prion AGAAAAGA palindrome hydrophobic region (113-120) has amyloid fibril forming properties and plays an important role in prion diseases. However, due to the unstable, noncrystalline and insoluble nature of the amyloid fibril, to date structural information on AGAAAAGA region (113-120) has been very limited. This region falls just within the N-terminal unstructured region PrP (1-123) of prion proteins. Traditional X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy experimental methods cannot be used to get its structural information. Under this background, this paper introduces a novel approach of the canonical dual theory to address the 3D atomic-resolution structure of prion AGAAAAGA amyloid fibrils. The novel and powerful canonical dual computational approach introduced in this paper is for the molecular modeling of prion AGAAAAGA amyloid fibrils, and that the optimal atomic-resolution structures of prion AGAAAAGA amyloid fibils presented in this paper are useful for the drive to find treatments for prion diseases in the field of medicinal chemistry. Overall, this paper presents an important method and provides useful information for treatments of prion diseases.

21723808|a|The misfolding of alpha-synuclein (alphaS) to a cross-beta-sheet amyloid structure is associated with pathological conditions in Parkinson's and other neurodegenerative diseases. Using pulse electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy combined with a cross-labeling strategy involving four double mutants, we were able to determine the intramolecular distance between the extremal beta-strands. The distance of 4.5 +- 0.5 nm is in good agreement with the dimensions of a protofilament reported by other low-resolution techniques, such as x-ray scattering and atomic force microscopy.

21723896|t|Amyloid-beta induced toxicity involves ganglioside expression and is sensitive to GM1 neuroprotective action.
21723896|a|The effect of Abeta25-35 peptide, in its fibrillar and non-fibrillar forms, on ganglioside expression in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures was investigated. Gangliosides were endogenously labeled with D-[1-C(14)] galactose and results showed that Abeta25-35 affected ganglioside expression, depending on the peptide aggregation state, that is, fibrillar Abeta25-35 caused an increase in GM3 labeling and a reduction in GD1b labeling, whereas the non-fibrillar form was able to enhance GM1 expression. Interestingly, GM1 exhibited a neuroprotective effect in this organotypic model, since pre-treatment of the hippocampal slices with GM1 10 muM was able to prevent the toxicity triggered by the fibrillar Abeta25-35, when measured by propidium iodide uptake protocol. With the purpose of further investigating a possible mechanism of action, we analyzed the effect of GM1 treatment (1, 6, 12 and 24h) upon the Abeta-induced alterations on GSK3beta dephosphorylation/activation state. Results demonstrated an important effect after 24-h incubation, with GM1 preventing the Abeta-induced dephosphorylation (activation) of GSK3beta, a signaling pathway involved in apoptosis triggering and neuronal death in models of Alzheimer's disease. Taken together, present results provide a new and important support for ganglioside participation in development of Alzheimer's disease experimental models and suggest a protective role for GM1 in Abeta-induced toxicity. This may be useful for designing new therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's treatment.

21723897|t|Abeta(42) induced MRI changes in aged rabbit brain resembles AD brain.
21723897|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia and is structurally characterized by brain atrophy and loss of brain volume. Abeta is one of the widely accepted causative factors of AD. Abeta deposition is positively correlated with brain atrophy in AD. In the present study, structural brain imaging techniques such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) were used to measure neuroanatomical alterations in Alzheimer's disease brain. MRI is a non-invasive method to study brain structure. The objective of the present study was to elucidate the role of Abeta on brain structure in the aged rabbit brain. Among 20 aged rabbits, one batch (n=10) rabbits was injected chronically with Abeta(1-42) and another batch (n=10) with saline. The MRI was conducted before Abeta(1-42)/saline injection and after 45 days of Abeta(1-42)/saline injection. All the aged rabbits underwent MRI analysis and were euthanized after 45 days. The MRI results showed a significant reduction in thickness of frontal lobe, hippocampus, midbrain, temporal lobe and increases in the lateral ventricle volume. We also conducted an MRI study on AD (n=10) and normal (n=10) cases and analyzed for the thicknesses of frontal lobe, hippocampus, midbrain, temporal lobe and lateral ventricle lobe. We found significant reductions in thickness of the frontal lobe and the hippocampus. However, no significant reduction in the thickness of midbrain, temporal lobe or increase in the lateral ventricle volume was observed compared to normal. Correlations in brain atrophy changes between rabbit brain and human AD brain were found for frontal lobe and hippocampal regions. In contrast, other regions such as midbrain, temporal lobe, and lateral ventricles were not correlated with rabbit brain atrophy changes in the corresponding regions. The relevance of these changes in AD is discussed.

21724950|t|Semagacestat pharmacokinetics are not significantly affected by formulation, food, or time of dosing in healthy participants.
21724950|a|Semagacestat, a gamma-secretase inhibitor, reduces formation of amyloid beta peptide. Two single-dose (140 mg), open-label, randomized, 3-period, crossover studies evaluated the effect of formulation, food, and time of dosing on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of semagacestat in healthy participants. The first study (n = 14) compared tablet to capsules. For all formulations, the median time to maximum plasma concentration (t(max)) was generally 1.0 hour. Plasma elimination was rapid, with a half-life of approximately 2.5 hours. Tablet form II bioavailability (F) relative to capsule was approximately 100% (F = 1.03 [90% confidence interval (CI), 0.96-1.10]). In the second study, participants (n = 27) received semagacestat either fed or fasting in the morning or fasting in the evening. No significant change in exposure (AUC(0- ) [area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to infinity] ratio = 1.02, [90% CI, 0.990-1.05]) occurred with food, whereas maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) declined approximately 15%, and median t(max) was delayed to 1.5 hours. Time of dosing made no significant difference in AUC(0- ), C(max), or t(max) (AUC(0- ) ratio 1.01, [90% CI, 0.975-1.04]). No clinically significant safety concerns occurred in either study. Accordingly, semagacestat may be dosed without regard to formulation, food, or time of administration.

21725313|t|Potent amyloidogenicity and pathogenicity of Abeta43.
21725313|a|The amyloid-beta peptide Abeta42 is known to be a primary amyloidogenic and pathogenic agent in Alzheimer's disease. However, the role of Abeta43, which is found just as frequently in the brains of affected individuals, remains unresolved. We generated knock-in mice containing a pathogenic presenilin-1 R278I mutation that causes overproduction of Abeta43. Homozygosity was embryonic lethal, indicating that the mutation involves a loss of function. Crossing amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice with heterozygous mutant mice resulted in elevated Abeta43, impairment of short-term memory and acceleration of amyloid-beta pathology, which accompanied pronounced accumulation of Abeta43 in plaque cores similar in biochemical composition to those observed in the brains of affected individuals. Consistently, Abeta43 showed a higher propensity to aggregate and was more neurotoxic than Abeta42. Other pathogenic presenilin mutations also caused overproduction of Abeta43 in a manner correlating with Abeta42 and with the age of disease onset. These findings indicate that Abeta43, an overlooked species, is potently amyloidogenic, neurotoxic and abundant in vivo.

Activation of Notch receptor is executed through intramembrane proteolysis by gamma-secretase, which is a multimeric membrane-embedded protease comprised of presenilin, nicastrin (NCT), anterior pharynx defective 1 and PEN-2. In this study, we report the neutralization of the gamma-secretase activity by a novel monoclonal antibody A5226A against the extracellular domain of NCT, generated by using a recombinant budded baculovirus as an immunogen. This antibody recognized fully glycosylated mature NCT in the active gamma-secretase complex on the cell surface, and inhibited the gamma-secretase activity by competing with the substrate binding in vitro. Moreover, A5226A abolished the gamma-secretase activity-dependent growth of cancer cells in a xenograft model. Our data provide compelling evidence that NCT is a molecular target for the mechanism-based inhibition of gamma-secretase, and that targeting NCT might be a novel therapeutic strategy against cancer caused by aberrant gamma-secretase activity and Notch signaling.

21726591|t|Effect of rice-expressed amyloid beta in the Tg2576 Alzheimer's disease transgenic mouse model.
21726591|a|One of the main hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is senile plaques composed of amyloid beta (Abeta). We developed a new edible vaccine: rice expressing GFP-Abeta42. In a previous report, we described the production of anti-Abeta antibodies in B6 mice fed Abeta rice mixed with cholera toxin B subunit (CTB). In this report, we investigated whether Abeta rice had therapeutic effects in the Tg2576 AD model mice. The anti-Abeta antibody titer was increased and levels of intracerebral Abeta (soluble and insoluble) and serum Abeta decreased. Because the value of IgG1/IgG2a in the Abeta feeding group was >1, immunization via Abeta rice may induce a non-inflammatory Th2 reaction. We also found that the Abeta vaccine improved memory, as assessed in a Y-maze test. The number of arm entries in the Y-maze test was lower in the Abeta feeding group than in the control group. These results suggest that the new edible vaccine Abeta rice may have therapeutic effects in AD.

21726674|t|Proteomic identification of specifically carbonylated brain proteins in APP(NLh)/APP(NLh) x PS-1(P264L)/PS-1(P264L) human double mutant knock-in mice model of Alzheimer disease as a function of age.
21726674|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and is characterized pathologically by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), senile plaques (SPs), and loss of synapses. The main component of SP is amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), a 39 to 43 amino acid peptide, generated by the proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the action of beta- and gamma-secretases. The presenilins (PS) are components of the gamma-secretase, which contains the protease active center. Mutations in PS enhance the production of the Abeta42 peptide. To date, more than 160 mutations in PS1 have been identified. Many PS mutations increase the production of the beta-secretase-mediated C-terminal (CT) 99 amino acid-long fragment (CT99), which is subsequently cleaved by gamma-secretase to yield Abeta peptides. Abeta has been proposed to induce oxidative stress and neurotoxicity. Previous studies from our laboratory and others showed an age-dependent increase in oxidative stress markers, loss of lipid asymmetry, and Abeta production and amyloid deposition in the brain of APP/PS1 mice. In the present study, we used APP (NLh)/APP(NLh) x PS-1(P246L)/PS-1(P246L) human double mutant knock-in APP/PS-1 mice to identify specific targets of brain protein carbonylation in an age-dependent manner. We found a number of proteins that are oxidatively modified in APP/PS1 mice compared to age-matched controls. The relevance of the identified proteins to the progression and pathogenesis of AD is discussed.

21728971|t|Current drug targets for modulating Alzheimer's amyloid precursor protein: role of specific micro-RNA species.
21728971|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the United States and is increasing in prevalence every year throughout the world. Recent clinical trial failures highlight the need for further insights into the molecular events that underlie the neurobiology of AD. Pathological aberrations in AD are believed to result, in part, from excess accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), a product of Abeta precursor protein (APP). Targeting APP levels would then be expected to reduce Abeta production in all forms of AD. Therefore, clarifying the regulatory network that governs APP expression is likely to reveal molecular players that could serve as novel drug targets. This review highlights recent work demonstrating the involvement of microRNA (miRNA) in this regulatory network. MiRNA are small, non-coding RNA that interact with target mRNA at sites of imperfect complementarity and mediate translational inhibition or transcript destabilization. We first review the neurobiology of AD and describe current therapeutic strategies. We then review transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms utilized by cells to control APP expression. We conclude by highlighting recent work, including our own, which suggests miRNA are integral components of this regulatory framework and potential targets for future AD therapeutics.

21728980|t|Novel abeta isoforms in Alzheimer's disease - their role in diagnosis and treatment.
21728980|a|The last decades have witnessed an explosion in studies of the role of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the progress of the neurodegenerative disorder Alzheimer's disease (AD) and it is now widely accepted that Abeta is related to the pathogenesis of AD. For example, studies have shown that Abeta is neurotoxic and that the neurotoxicity of Abeta is related to its aggregation state. The concentration of the 42 amino acid form of Abeta (Abeta1-42) is reduced in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from AD patients, which is believed to reflect the AD pathology with plaques in the brain acting as sinks. Less well investigated, however, is the ability of other Abeta isoforms to distinguish AD patients from controls and to identify treatment effects in clinical trials. Recently, novel C-truncated forms of Abeta (Abeta1-14, Abeta1-15, and Abeta1-16) were identified in human CSF. The presence of these small peptides is consistent with a catabolic amyloid precursor protein cleavage pathway by beta- followed by alpha-secretase. It has been shown that Abeta1-14, Abeta1-15, and Abeta1-16 increase dose-dependently in response to gamma-secretase inhibitor treatment while Abeta1-42 levels are unchanged. Here, we review the many aspects of Abeta and its isoforms with special focus on their potential role as diagnostic and theragnostic markers.

21729418|t|Amyloid imaging.
21729418|a|Molecular neuroimaging techniques such as PET are proving valuable in the early and differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD).With the advent of new therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing beta-amyloid (Abeta) burden in the brain to potentially prevent or delay functional and irreversible cognitive loss, there is increased interest in developing agents that allow assessment of Abeta burden in vivo. Amyloid imaging with PET has proven useful in the discrimination of dementias, showing significantly higher Abeta burden in the gray matter of AD patients when compared with healthy controls or patients with frontotemporal dementia. ApoE epsilon4 carriers, independent of diagnosis or disease severity, present with higher Abeta burden than non-epsilon4 carriers. Amyloid imaging matches histopathological reports in aging and dementia, reflecting the true regional density of Abeta plaques in cortical areas. It also appears to be more sensitive than FDG-PET for the diagnosis of AD. In healthy older people there is an increasing prevalence of amyloid positive scans with age, rising from 20% in the seventh decade to 60% in the ninth decade. Of people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 40-60% present with detectable cortical Abeta deposition. In both groups, Abeta deposition is associated with a higher risk for cognitive decline and dementia due to AD. These observations suggest that Abeta deposition is not part of normal aging, supporting the hypothesis that it occurs well before the onset of symptoms and is likely to represent preclinical AD in asymptomatic persons and prodromal AD in MCI. Further longitudinal observations, coupled with different disease-specific tracers and biomarkers, are required to confirm this hypothesis and further elucidate the precise role of Abeta deposition in the course of AD.

21734608|t|Retinal amyloid peptides and complement factor H in transgenic models of Alzheimer's disease.
21734608|a|Murine transgenic models of Alzheimer's disease (Tg-AD) have been useful to analyze the contribution of beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP), Abeta42 peptide deposition, and the proinflammatory mechanisms that characterize Alzheimer-type neuropathology. In this report, we have studied the levels of betaAPP, Abeta40 and Abeta42 peptide, as well as the innate immune and inflammatory response-regulator complement factor H in the brain and retina in four different Tg-AD models including Tg2576, PSAPP, 3xTg-AD, and 5xFAD. Aged, symptomatic 5xFAD mice showed the highest retinal abundance of Abeta42 peptides and the highest deficits in complement factor H. This may be a useful model to study the mechanisms of amyloid-mediated inflammatory degeneration. The superior colliculus and retina obtained from late-stage Alzheimer's disease revealed upregulated amyloidogenic and inflammatory signaling along the anteroposterior axis of the retinal-primary visual cortex pathway.

21735075|t|Xanthoceraside attenuates amyloid beta peptide25-35-induced learning and memory impairments in mice.
21735075|a|RATIONALE: In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the deposition of amyloid peptides is invariably associated with oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. Xanthoceraside has anti-inflammatory and antioxidative activities. However, it remains unclear whether xanthoceraside improves amyloid beta (Abeta)-induced neurotoxicity. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of xanthoceraside on behavioral impairments, inflammatory responses, and oxidative stress induced by Abeta peptide(25-35) (Abeta(25-35)) in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The mice were treated orally with xanthoceraside (0.02, 0.08, or 0.32 mg/kg, once daily) after the intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta(25-35) (day 0). Cognitive functions were evaluated in Y-maze (day 6) and novel object recognition tests (days 7 and 8). Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nitrotyrosine levels in the hippocampus were examined (day 9). The mRNA expressions of iNOS and interleukin-4 (IL-4) in the hippocampus were measured 2 h and 3 days after the Abeta(25-35) injection by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Xanthoceraside significantly attenuated behavioral impairments induced by Abeta(25-35) in the Y-maze and novel object recognition tests. Repeated treatment with xanthoceraside significantly inhibited the increase in the expression of iNOS and nitrotyrosine in the hippocampus induced by Abeta(25-35), which is associated with an enhanced expression of the IL-4 mRNA. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that xanthoceraside attenuates memory impairments through amelioration of oxidative stress and inflammatory responses induced by Abeta(25-35) and is a potential candidate for an AD treatment.

21740063|t|Molecular dynamics simulations reveal the protective role of cholesterol in beta-amyloid protein-induced membrane disruptions in neuronal membrane mimics.
21740063|a|Interactions of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides with neuronal membranes have been associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the molecular details remain unclear. We used atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the interactions of Abeta(40) and Abeta(42) with model neuronal membranes. The differences between cholesterol-enriched and depleted lipid domains were investigated by the use of model phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipid bilayers with and without 40 mol % cholesterol. A total of 16 independent 200 ns simulation replicates were investigated. The surface area per lipid, bilayer thickness, water permeability barrier, and lipid order parameter, which are sensitive indicators of membrane disruption, were significantly altered by the inserted state of the protein. We conclude that cholesterol protects Abeta-induced membrane disruption and inhibits beta-sheet formation of Abeta on the lipid bilayer. The latter could represent a two-dimensional (2D) seeding template for the formation of toxic oligomeric Abeta in the pathogenesis of AD.

21741124|t|Fyn knock-down increases Abeta, decreases phospho-tau, and worsens spatial learning in 3xTg-AD mice.
21741124|a|Fyn kinase phosphorylates tau and exacerbates amyloid beta (Abeta)-mediated synaptic dysfunction. However, Fyn also increases the nonpathological cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), suggesting opposing roles for Fyn in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To determine the effect of Fyn on both Abeta and tau pathologies, we crossed homozygous Alzheimer's disease triple transgenic (3xTg) mice harboring mutations in amyloid precursor protein, presenilin-1, and tau with wild-type or Fyn knockout mice to generate Fyn(+/+)3xTg(+/-) or Fyn(+/-)3xTg(+/-) mice. We found that Fyn(+/-)3xTg(+/-) mice had increased soluble and intracellular Abeta, and these changes were accompanied by impaired performance on the Morris water maze at 18 months. Fyn(+/-)3xTg(+/-) mice had decreased phosphorylated tau at 15-18 months (as did Fyn knockout mice), but Fyn(+/-)3xTg(+/-) mice had increased phosphorylated tau by 24 months. In addition, we observed that Fyn(+/-)3xTg(+/-) males were delayed in developing Abeta pathology compared with females, and displayed better spatial learning performance at 18 months. Overall, these findings suggest that loss of Fyn at early stages of disease increases soluble Abeta accumulation and worsens spatial learning in the absence of changes in tau phosphorylation.

21741125|t|AD synapses contain abundant Abeta monomer and multiple soluble oligomers, including a 56-kDa assembly.
21741125|a|Much evidence indicates that soluble amyloid beta (Abeta) oligomers are key mediators of early cognitive loss, but the localization and key peptide species remain unclear. We have used flow cytometry analysis to demonstrate that surviving Alzheimer's disease (AD) synapses accumulate both Abeta and phosphorylated tau (p-tau). The present experiments use peptide-specific X-map assays and Western blot analyses to identify the Abeta peptide species in synaptosome-enriched samples from normal human subjects, neurologic controls, and AD cases. Abeta40 peptide levels did not vary, but both Abeta42 and Abeta oligomers were increased in soluble AD extracts, with oligomer levels 20-fold higher in aqueous compared with detergent extracts. In Western blot analysis, a ladder of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-stable oligomers was observed in AD cases, varying in size from monomer, the major peptide observed, to larger assemblies up to about 200 kDa and larger. Multiple oligomers, including monomer, small oligomers, a 56-kDa assembly, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) were correlated with the Abeta level measured in flow cytometry-purified synaptosomes. These results suggest that multiple amyloid precursor protein processing pathways are active in AD synapses and multiple soluble oligomeric assemblies may contribute to synaptic dysfunction.

21741127|t|Serial CSF sampling in Alzheimer's disease: specific versus non-specific markers.
21741127|a|In this longitudinal study we investigated change over time in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of amyloid-beta 40 and 42 (Abeta40 and Abeta42), total tau (tau), tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (ptau-181), isoprostane, neurofilaments heavy (NfH) and light (NfL). Twenty-four nondemented subjects, 62 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 68 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients underwent 2 lumbar punctures, with minimum interval of 6, and a mean +- SD of 24 +- 13 months. Linear mixed models were used to assess change over time. Amyloid-beta 42, tau, and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181, differentiated between diagnosis groups (p < 0.05), whereas isoprostane, neurofilaments heavy, and NfL did not. In contrast, effects of follow-up time were only found for nonspecific CSF biomarkers: levels of NfL decreased, and levels of isoprostane, amyloid-beta 40, and tau increased over time (p < 0.05). Isoprostane showed the largest increase. In addition, increase in isoprostane was associated with progression of mild cognitive impairment to AD, and with cognitive decline as reflected by change in Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). Contrary to AD-specific markers, nonspecific CSF biomarkers, most notably isoprostane, showed change over time. These markers could potentially be used to monitor disease progression in AD.

21742799|t|Modeling of pathological traits in Alzheimer's disease based on systemic extracellular signaling proteome.
21742799|a|The study of chronic brain diseases including Alzheimer's disease in patients is typically limited to brain imaging or psychometric testing. Given the epidemic rise and insufficient knowledge about pathological pathways in sporadic Alzheimer's disease, new tools are required to identify the molecular changes underlying this disease. We hypothesize that levels of specific secreted cellular signaling proteins in cerebrospinal fluid or plasma correlate with pathological changes in the Alzheimer's disease brain and can thus be used to discover signaling pathways altered in the disease. Here we measured 91 proteins of this subset of the cellular communication proteome in plasma or cerebrospinal fluid in patients with Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal controls to mathematically model disease-specific molecular traits. We found small numbers of signaling proteins that were able to model key pathological markers of Alzheimer's disease, including levels of cerebrospinal fluid beta-amyloid and tau, and classify disease in independent samples. Several of these factors had previously been implicated in Alzheimer's disease supporting the validity of our approach. Our study also points to proteins which were previously unknown to be associated with Alzheimer's disease thereby implicating novel signaling pathways in this disorder.

21743479|t|Essential role for the prolyl isomerase Pin1 in Toll-like receptor signaling and type I interferon-mediated immunity.
21743479|a|Toll-like receptors (TLRs) shape innate and adaptive immunity to microorganisms. The enzyme IRAK1 transduces signals from TLRs, but mechanisms for its activation and regulation remain unknown. We found here that TLR7 and TLR9 activated the isomerase Pin1, which then bound to IRAK1; this resulted in activation of IRAK1 and facilitated its release from the receptor complex to activate the transcription factor IRF7 and induce type I interferons. Consequently, Pin1-deficient cells and mice failed to mount TLR-mediated, interferon-dependent innate and adaptive immune responses. Given the critical role of aberrant activation of IRAK1 and type I interferons in various immune diseases, controlling IRAK1 activation via inhibition of Pin1 may represent a useful therapeutic approach.

21745760|t|Anesthesia in presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease: a study using the triple-transgenic mouse model.
21745760|a|BACKGROUND: Experimental evidence suggests that anesthetics accelerate symptomatic neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Because AD pathology precedes symptoms, we asked ourselves whether anesthetic exposure in the presymptomatic interval accelerated neuropathology and appearance of symptoms. METHODS: Triple-transgenic AD mice were exposed to general aesthetics, either halothane or isoflurane, at 2, 4, and 6 months of age, they then underwent water maze cognitive testing 2 months later, and subsequently their brains were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunoblots, and immunohistochemistry for amyloid and tau pathology and biomarkers. RESULTS: Learning and memory improved after halothane exposure in the 2-month-old group relative to controls, but no changes were noted in the isoflurane group. When gender was examined in all age groups, females exposed to halothane performed better as compared with those exposed to isoflurane or controls. Therefore, improvement in the 2-month exposure group is most likely because of a gender effect. Level of phospho-tau in the hippocampus was significantly increased 2 months after anesthesia, especially in the 6-month exposure group, but changes in amyloid, caspase, microglia, or synaptophysin levels were not detected. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that exposure to two different inhalation-type anesthetics during the presymptomatic phase of AD does not accelerate cognitive decline, after 2 months, and may cause a stress response, marked by hippocampal phosphorylated tau, resulting in preconditioning against the ongoing neuropathology, primarily in female mice.

21747004|t|Association between in vivo fluorine 18-labeled flutemetamol amyloid positron emission tomography imaging and in vivo cerebral cortical histopathology.
21747004|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the correspondence of in vivo quantitative estimates of brain uptake of fluorine 18-labeled flutemetamol with immunohistochemical estimates of amyloid levels in patients who underwent previous biopsy. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of 18F-flutemetamol positron emission tomography (PET) findings in patients with prior cortical biopsy specimen stained for the presence or absence of amyloid plaques. SETTING: University hospital. Patients Seven patients who previously had a prior right frontal cortical biopsy at the site of ventriculoperitoneal placement for presumed normal pressure hydrocephalus were recruited. Inclusion criteria included an adequate biopsy specimen for detection and quantification of beta-amyloid pathology and age older than 50 years. Intervention All patients underwent an 18F-flutemetamol PET scan. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quantitative measures of 18F-flutemetamol uptake (standardized uptake value ratio, a ratio of mean target cortex activity divided by that in a cerebellar reference region) were made at a location contralateral to the biopsy site and compared with estimates of amyloid load based on immunohistochemical and histological staining. RESULTS: There was complete agreement between visual reads of 18F-flutemetamol PET scans (3 blinded readers with majority rule) and histology. A regression model, including time from biopsy as a covariate, demonstrated a significant relationship (P = .01) between 18F-flutemetamol uptake and percentage of area of amyloid measured by a monoclonal antibody raised against amyloid (NAB228). Similar results were found with the amyloid-specific monoclonal antibody 4G8 and Thioflavin S. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, these data are the first to demonstrate the concordance of 18F-flutemetamol PET imaging with histopathology, supporting its sensitivity to detect amyloid and potential use in the study and detection of Alzheimer disease.

21747030|t|In vivo assessment of vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 in dementia with lewy bodies and Alzheimer disease.
21747030|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic potential of imaging striatal monoaminergic terminal integrity with the vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) radioligand (18)F 9-fluropropyl-(+)-dihydrotetrabenazine ([(18)F]AV-133) and positron emission tomography to distinguish dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) from Alzheimer disease (AD). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Nine patients with DLB, 10 patients with AD, 20 patients with Parkinson disease (PD), and 10 healthy age-matched control subjects underwent [(18)F]AV-133 positron emission tomography studies. VMAT2 density was calculated through normalized tissue uptake value ratios at 120 to 140 minutes postinjection using the primary visual cortex as the reference region. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Comparison of the tissue ratio for [(18)F]AV-133 between the different clinical diagnostic groups. RESULTS: Lower VMAT2 densities were observed in patients with DLB when compared with patients with AD especially in the posterior putamen (caudate: mean [SD], 1.24 [0.6] vs 2.83 [0.9]; P < .001; effect size = 2.1; anterior putamen: mean [SD], 0.90 [0.5] vs 3.01 [0.9]; P < .001; effect size = 2.9; posterior putamen: mean [SD], 0.62 [0.5] vs 2.87 [0.8]; P < .001; effect size = 3.4). Compared with healthy controls, [(18)F]AV-133 tissue ratios were significantly lower by 88% and 74% in the posterior putamen, 74% and 65% in the anterior putamen, and 53% and 51% in the caudate nucleus of patients with PD and DLB, respectively. In contrast to patients with PD and DLB, no reductions were observed in patients with AD. CONCLUSIONS: [(18)F]AV-133 allows assessment of nigrostriatal degeneration in Lewy body diseases. [(18)F]AV-133 can robustly detect reductions of dopaminergic nigrostriatal afferents in patients with DLB and assist in the differential diagnosis from AD.

21749739|t|Predictors of rapid cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease: results from the Australian imaging, biomarkers and lifestyle (AIBL) study of ageing.
21749739|a|BACKGROUND: The AIBL study, which commenced in November 2006, is a two-center prospective study of a cohort of 1112 volunteers aged 60+. The cohort includes 211 patients meeting NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for Alzheimer's disease (AD) (180 probable and 31 possible). We aimed to identify factors associated with rapid cognitive decline over 18 months in this cohort of AD patients. METHODS: We defined rapid cognitive decline as a drop of 6 points or more on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) between baseline and 18-month follow-up. Analyses were also conducted with a threshold of 4, 5, 7 and 8 points, as well as with and without subjects who had died or were too severely affected to be interviewed at 18 months and after, both including and excluding subjects whose AD diagnosis was "possible" AD. We sought correlations between rapid cognitive decline and demographic, clinical and biological variables. RESULTS: Of the 211 AD patients recruited at baseline, we had available data for 156 (73.9%) patients at 18 months. Fifty-one patients were considered rapid cognitive decliners (32.7%). A higher Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR) and higher CDR "sum of boxes" score at baseline were the major predictors of rapid cognitive decline in this population. Furthermore, using logistic regression model analysis, patients treated with a cholinesterase inhibitor (CheI) had a higher risk of being rapid cognitive decliners, as did males and those of younger age. CONCLUSIONS: Almost one third of patients satisfying established research criteria for AD experienced rapid cognitive decline. Worse baseline functional and cognitive status and treatment with a CheI were the major factors associated with rapid cognitive decline over 18 months in this population.

21756976|t|The selective and competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, (-)-6-phosphonomethyl-deca-hydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid, prevents synaptic toxicity induced by amyloid-beta in mice.
21756976|a|The toxicity of amyloid beta (Abeta) is highly associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), which has a high incidence in elderly people worldwide. While the current treatment for moderate and severe AD includes blockage of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), the molecular mechanisms of its effect are still poorly understood. Herein, we report that a single i.p. administration of the selective and competitive (NMDAR) antagonist LY235959 reduced Abeta neurotoxicity by preventing the down-regulation of glial glutamate transporters (glutamate-aspartate transporter (GLAST) and glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1)), the decrease in glutamate uptake, and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by Abeta(1-40). Importantly, the blockage of NMDAR restored the Abeta(1-40)-induced synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairment. However, LY235959 failed to prevent the inflammatory response associated with Abeta(1-40) treatment. Altogether, our data indicate that the acute administration of Abeta promotes oxidative stress, a decrease in glutamate transporter expression, and neurotoxicity. Our results reinforce the idea that NMDAR plays a critical regulatory action in Abeta toxicity and they provide further pre-clinical evidence for the potential role of the selective and competitive NMDAR antagonists in the treatment of AD.

21757762|t|Amyloid beta peptide-(1-42) induces internalization and degradation of beta2 adrenergic receptors in prefrontal cortical neurons.
21757762|a|Emerging evidence indicates that amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) initially induces subtle alterations in synaptic function in Alzheimer disease. We have recently shown that Abeta binds to beta(2) adrenergic receptor (beta(2)AR) and activates protein kinase A (PKA) signaling for glutamatergic regulation of synaptic activities. Here we show that in the cerebrums of mice expressing human familial mutant presenilin 1 and amyloid precursor protein genes, the levels of beta(2)AR are drastically reduced. Moreover, Abeta induces internalization of transfected human beta(2)AR in fibroblasts and endogenous beta(2)AR in primary prefrontal cortical neurons. In fibroblasts, Abeta treatment also induces transportation of beta(2)AR into lysosome, and prolonged Abeta treatment causes beta(2)AR degradation. The Abeta-induced beta(2)AR internalization requires the N terminus of the receptor containing the peptide binding sites and phosphorylation of beta(2)AR by G protein-coupled receptor kinase, not by PKA. However, the G protein-coupled receptor kinase phosphorylation of beta(2)AR and the receptor internalization are much slower than that induced by betaAR agonist isoproterenol. The Abeta-induced beta(2)AR internalization is also dependent on adaptor protein arrestin 3 and GTPase dynamin, but not arrestin 2. Functionally, pretreatment of primary prefrontal cortical neurons with Abeta induces desensitization of beta(2)AR, which leads to attenuated response to subsequent stimulation with isoproterenol, including decreased cAMP levels, PKA activities, PKA phosphorylation of serine 845 on alpha-amino-2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-oxo-4-isoxazolepropanoic acid (AMPA) receptor subunit 1 (GluR1), and AMPA receptor-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents. This study indicates that Abeta induces beta(2)AR internalization and degradation leading to impairment of adrenergic and glutamatergic activities.

21757905|t|Decreased alpha-synuclein serum levels in patients with Lewy body dementia compared to Alzheimer's disease patients and control subjects.
21757905|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Detection and differentiation of neurodegenerative dementias, such as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), with blood-based biomarkers would facilitate diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: By use of a commercially available ELISA kit, we measured alpha-synuclein levels in the serum of 40 DLB patients and controls, and of 80 AD patients. RESULTS: We found significantly reduced alpha-synuclein serum levels in DLB compared to both AD (p = 0.006) and control subjects (p = 0.001), reaching an area under the curve of >0.70. CONCLUSION: Although these results do not justify a definition of serum alpha-synuclein as a potential single biomarker, results may contribute to a multimarker strategy in DLB diagnosis.

21760540|t|Targeting vascular amyloid in arterioles of Alzheimer disease transgenic mice with amyloid beta protein antibody-coated nanoparticles.
21760540|a|The relevance of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD) and dementia in general emphasizes the importance of developing novel targeting approaches for detecting and treating cerebrovascular amyloid (CVA) deposits. We developed a nanoparticle-based technology that uses a monoclonal antibody against fibrillar human amyloid-beta42 that is surface coated onto a functionalized phospholipid monolayer. We demonstrate that this conjugated nanoparticle binds to CVA deposits in arterioles of AD transgenic mice (Tg2576) after infusion into the external carotid artery using 3 different approaches. The first 2 approaches use a blood vessel enrichment of homogenized brain and a leptomeningeal vessel preparation from thin tangential brain slices from the surface of the cerebral cortex. Targeting of CVA by the antibody-coated nanoparticle was visualized using fluorescent lissamine rhodamine-labeled phospholipids in the nanoparticles, which were compared with fluorescent staining of the endothelial cells and amyloid deposits using confocal laser scanning microscopy. The third approach used high-field strength magnetic resonance imaging of antibody-coated iron oxide nanoparticles after infusion into the external carotid artery. Dark foci of contrast enhancement in cortical arterioles were observed in T2*-weighted images of ex vivo AD mouse brains that correlated histologically with CVA deposits. The targeting ability of these nanoparticles to CVA provides opportunities for the prevention and treatment of CAA.

21762767|t|A modified formulation of Chinese traditional medicine improves memory impairment and reduces Abeta level in the Tg-APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
21762767|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: SuHeXiang Wan (SHXW), a Chinese traditional medicine has been used orally for the treatment of seizures, infantile convulsion, stroke and so forth. Previously, we reported the effects of modified SHXW essential oil mixture of the fragrance containing herbs on the sedative effect, anticonvulsant property and antioxidative activity after fragrance inhalation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was undertaken to evaluate beneficial effects of a modified recipe of SHXW (termed as KSOP1009) consisting of a ethanol extract of 8 herbs including resin of Liquidambar orientalis Miller, seed of Myristica fragrans Houtt., rhizome of Cnidium officinale Makino, lumber of Santalum album L., fructus of Piper longum L., flower buds of Eugenia caryophyllata Merrill et Perry, pollen of Typha orientalis Presl., and root of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge in the neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The transgenic mice of AD, Tg-APPswe/PS1dE9, were fed KSOP1009 or as a positive control, donepezil for 3 months from 4.5 months of age. Behavioral, immunological and ELISA analyses were used to assess memory impairment, Abeta accumulation and plaque deposition in the brain. Other in vitro works were performed to examine whether KSOP1009 inhibits the Abeta(1-42)-induced neurotoxicity in human neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y cells. RESULTS: Intake of KSOP1009 improved the Abeta-induced memory impairment and suppressed Abeta levels and plaque deposition in the brain of Tg-APPswe/PS1dE9 mice as much as that of donepezil treatment. KSOP1009 prevented the down-regulation of phospho-CREB and increased AKT phosphorylation in the AD-like brains. Moreover, KSOP1009 suppresses Abeta-induced apoptosis and ROS production in SH-SY5Y cells. CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that KSOP1009 may develop as a therapeutic drug for treatment of AD patients.

21763147|t|NSAID-derived gamma-secretase modulation requires an acidic moiety on the carbazole scaffold.
21763147|a|Modulation of gamma-secretase activity holds potential for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Most NSAID-derived gamma-secretase modulators feature a carboxylic acid, which may impair blood-brain barrier permeation. The structure activity relationship of 33 carbazoles featuring diverse carboxylic acid isosteres or metabolic precursors thereof was established in a cellular amyloid secretion assay. The modulatory activity was observed for acidic moieties and metabolically labile esters only, which supports our hypothesis of an acid-lysine interaction to be relevant for this type of gamma-secretase modulators.

21763787|t|Should Alzheimer's disease be equated with human brain ageing? A maladaptive interaction between brain evolution and senescence.
21763787|a|In this review Alzheimer's disease is seen as a maladaptive interaction between human brain evolution and senescence. It is predicted to occur in everyone although does not necessarily lead to dementia. The pathological process is initiated in relation to a senescence mediated functional down-regulation in the posteromedial cortex (Initiation Phase). This leads to a loss of glutamatergic excitatory input to layer II entorhinal cortex neurons. A human specific maladaptive neuroplastic response is initiated in these neurons leading to neuronal dysfunction, NFT formation and death. This leads to further loss of glutamatergic excitatory input and propagation of the maladaptive response along excitatory pathways linking evolutionary progressed vulnerable neurons (Propagation Phase). Eventually neurons are affected in many brain areas resulting in dementia. Possible therapeutic approaches include enhancing glutamatergic transmission. The theory may have implications with regards to how Alzheimer's disease is classified.

21764480|t|HIV-1 Tat-induced cerebrovascular toxicity is enhanced in mice with amyloid deposits.
21764480|a|HIV-1-infected brains are characterized by elevated depositions of amyloid beta (Abeta); however, the interactions between Abeta and HIV-1 are poorly understood. In the present study, we administered specific HIV-1 protein Tat into the cerebral vasculature of 50-52-week-old double transgenic (B6C3-Tg) mice that express a chimeric mouse/human amyloid precursor protein (Mo/HuAPP695swe) and a mutant human presenilin 1 (PS1-dE9) and are characterized by increased Abeta depositions in the brain. Exposure to Tat increased permeability across cerebral capillaries, enhanced disruption of zonula occludens (ZO)-1 tight junction protein, and elevated brain expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in B6C3-Tg mice as compared with age-matched littermate controls. These changes were associated with increased leukocyte attachment and their transcapillary migration. The majority of Tat-induced effects were attenuated by treatment with a specific Rho inhibitor, hydroxyfasudil. The results of animal experiments were reproduced in cultured brain endothelial cells exposed to Abeta and/or Tat. The present data indicate that increased brain levels of Abeta can enhance vascular toxicity and proinflammatory responses induced by HIV-1 protein Tat.

21764791|t|Amyloid imaging with (18)F-florbetaben in Alzheimer disease and other dementias.
21764791|a|UNLABELLED: Amyloid imaging with (18)F-labeled radiotracers will allow widespread use, facilitating research, diagnosis, and therapeutic development for Alzheimer disease. The purpose of the study program was to compare cortical amyloid deposition using (18)F-florbetaben and PET in controls and subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), vascular dementia (VaD), Parkinson disease (PD), and Alzheimer disease (AD). METHODS: One hundred nine subjects in 3 clinical studies at Austin Health were reviewed: 32 controls, 20 subjects with MCI, and 30 patients with AD, 11 with FTLD, 7 with DLB, 5 with PD, and 4 with VaD underwent PET after intravenous injection of 300 MBq of (18)F-florbetaben. Standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) using the cerebellar cortex as a reference region were calculated between 90 and 110 min after injection. RESULTS: When compared with the other groups, AD patients demonstrated significantly higher SUVRs (P < 0.0001) in neocortical areas. Most AD patients (96%) and 60% of MCI subjects showed diffuse cortical (18)F-florbetaben retention. In contrast, only 9% of FTLD, 25% of VaD, 29% of DLB, and no PD patients and 16% of controls showed cortical binding. Although there was a correlation between Mini Mental State Examination and beta-amyloid burden in the MCI group, no correlation was observed in controls, FTLD or AD. CONCLUSION: (18)F-florbetaben had high sensitivity for AD, clearly distinguished patients with FTLD from AD, and provided results comparable to those reported with (11)C-Pittsburgh Compound B in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases.

21767502|t|Synchrotron x-ray microdiffraction reveals intrinsic structural features of amyloid deposits in situ.
21767502|a|Amyloidoses are increasingly recognized as a major public health concern in Western countries. All amyloidoses share common morphological, structural, and tinctorial properties. These consist of staining by specific dyes, a fibrillar aspect in electron microscopy and a typical cross-beta folding in x-ray diffraction patterns. Most studies that aim at deciphering the amyloid structure rely on fibers generated in vitro or extracted from tissues using protocols that may modify their intrinsic structure. Therefore, the fine details of the in situ architecture of the deposits remain unknown. Here, we present to our knowledge the first data obtained on ex vivo human renal tissue sections using x-ray microdiffraction. The typical cross-beta features from fixed paraffin-embedded samples are similar to those formed in vitro or extracted from tissues. Moreover, the fiber orientation maps obtained across glomerular sections reveal an intrinsic texture that is correlated with the glomerulus morphology. These results are of the highest importance to understanding the formation of amyloid deposits and are thus expected to trigger new incentives for tissue investigation. Moreover, the access to intrinsic structural parameters such as fiber size and orientation using synchrotron x-ray microdiffraction, could provide valuable information concerning in situ mechanisms and deposit formation with potential benefits for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

21768095|t|Mutations in nicastrin protein differentially affect amyloid beta-peptide production and Notch protein processing.
21768095|a|The gamma-secretase complex is responsible for intramembrane processing of over 60 substrates and is involved in Notch signaling as well as in the generation of the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta). Aggregated forms of Abeta have a pathogenic role in Alzheimer disease and, thus, reducing the Abeta levels by inhibiting gamma-secretase is a possible treatment strategy for Alzheimer disease. Regrettably, clinical trials have shown that inhibition of gamma-secretase results in Notch-related side effects. Therefore, it is of great importance to find ways to inhibit amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing without disturbing vital signaling pathways such as Notch. Nicastrin (Nct) is part of the gamma-secretase complex and has been proposed to be involved in substrate recognition and selection. We have investigated how the four evenly spaced and conserved cysteine residues in the Nct ectodomain affect APP and Notch processing. We mutated these cysteines to serines and analyzed them in cells lacking endogenous Nct. We found that two mutants, C213S (C2) and C230S (C3), differentially affected APP and Notch processing. Both the formation of Abeta and the intracellular domain of amyloid precursor protein (AICD) were reduced, whereas the production of Notch intracellular domain (NICD) was maintained on a high level, although C230S (C3) showed impaired complex assembly. Our data demonstrate that single residues in a gamma-secretase component besides presenilin are able to differentially affect APP and Notch processing.

21768116|t|DC2 and keratinocyte-associated protein 2 (KCP2), subunits of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex, are regulators of the gamma-secretase-directed processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP).
21768116|a|The oligosaccharyltransferase complex catalyzes the transfer of oligosaccharide from a dolichol pyrophosphate donor en bloc onto a free asparagine residue of a newly synthesized nascent chain during the translocation in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen. The role of the less known oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) subunits, DC2 and KCP2, recently identified still remains to be determined. Here, we have studied DC2 and KCP2, and we have established that DC2 and KCP2 are substrate-specific, affecting amyloid precursor protein (APP), indicating that they are not core components required for N-glycosylation and OST activity per se. We show for the first time that DC2 and KCP2 depletion affects APP processing, leading to an accumulation of C-terminal fragments, both C99 and C83, and a reduction in full-length mature APP. This reduction in mature APP levels was not due to a block in secretion because the levels of sAPPalpha secreted into the media were unaffected. We discover that DC2 and KCP2 depletion affects only the gamma-secretase complex, resulting in a reduction of the PS1 active fragment blocking Abeta production. Conversely, we show that the overexpression of DC2 and KCP2 causes an increase in the active gamma-secretase complex, particularly the N-terminal fragment of PS1 that is generated by endoproteolysis, leading to a stimulation of Abeta production upon overexpression of DC2 and KCP2. Our findings reveal that components of the OST complex for the first time can interact with the gamma-secretase and affect the APP processing pathway.

21771586|t|VEGF-induced angiogenesis ameliorates the memory impairment in APP transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
21771586|a|Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was investigated in the present study to see whether it could provide a therapeutic opportunity for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). PDGF-hAPP(V717I) transgenic mice were treated with VEGF or PBS by intraperitoneal injection for three consecutive days. The results showed that VEGF ameliorated the memory impairment of mice, accompanied by CD34(+) cells increasing in peripheral blood, vWF(+) vessels increasing in hippocampus, and CD34(+)/VEGFR2(+), vWF(+)/VEGFR2(+) and BrdU(+)/vWF(+) cells expressing in hippocampus. Furthermore, the level of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) was considerably enhanced and Abeta deposition was decreased in the brains of mice upon VEGF treatment. These observations suggest that VEGF should be pursued as a novel therapeutic agent for treatment of AD.

21780117|t|The impact of decreased bead count to determine concentrations of amyloid beta1-42, total-tau, and phosphorylated-tau181 in human cerebrospinal fluid using xMAP technology.
21780117|a|Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of human dementia. The lack of diagnostic tests and limited therapeutic options has driven the search for endogenous biomarkers. The INNO-BIA AlzBio3 assay is a multiplex flow-based immunoassay measuring Abeta42, tau, and p-tau in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This study assesses assays performance under varying bead count (BC) parameters. Original method validation parameters at 100 BC were acceptable. Reanalyses performed at 3, 10, 25, and 50 BCs were compared to 100 BC data by ANOVA, Bland-Altman analysis, evaluation of concordance correlation coefficients, and frequency distribution of coefficient of variation (CV) ranges. Method validation characteristics were acceptable with 100 BCs. Equivalency for 25 and 50 versus 100 BCs was demonstrated, but not for 3 and 10 BCs. A general trend of decreasing agreement between decreasing BCs and the 100 BC reference resulted in decreases in concordance coefficients rho(c) . The frequency of CV values greater than 20% increased with decreasing BCs, and CV values of 5% or less decreased with decreased BCs. Statistical analyses demonstrate that BCs of 3 and 10 are not equivalent with the reference and should not be used as a basis for determination of Abeta42, tau, and p-tau concentration in human CSF.

21780427|a|In this study an immuno-array for Abeta42 based on scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) was developed using conjugated gold nanoparticle (Au-NP) and antibody (Ab) complex. Fragmented monoclonal Ab against Abeta42 was allowed to immobilize on the Au-dot arrays followed by its target protein Abeta42 and Au NP and Ab complex. The surface structure of Au-NP and Ab complex on Au-dots was investigated with Atomic Force Microscopy and the current profile of fabricated immunosensing element was investigated with STM. The power spectrum derived from the current profile was found to be increasing with higher concentrations of Abeta42 having a detection limit of 100 fg/ml. The proposed technique can be a promising method to construct the highly sensitive and efficient protein chip of immunosensors arrays.

21780489|a|Ultraviolet nanoimprint lithography (UV-NIL) is a high volume and cost-effective patterning technique with sub-10 nm resolution. It has great potential as a candidate for next generation lithography. Using UV-NIL, nanowire patterns were successfully fabricated on a four-inch silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer under moderate conditions. The fabricated nanowire patterns were characterized by FE-SEM. Its electrical properties were confirmed by semiconductor parameter analysis. Monoclonal antibodies against beta-amyloid (1-42) were immobilized on the silicon nanowire using a chemical linker. Using this fabricated silicon nanowire device, beta-amyloid (1-42) levels of 1 pM to 100 nM were successfully determined from conductance versus time characteristics. Consequently, the nanopatterned SOI nanowire device can be applied to bioplatforms for the detection of proteins.

21781116|t|A monoclonal antibody against synthetic Abeta dimer assemblies neutralizes brain-derived synaptic plasticity-disrupting Abeta.
21781116|a|Diverse lines of evidence indicate that pre-fibrillar, diffusible assemblies of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) play an important role in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Although the precise molecular identity of these soluble toxins remains unsettled, recent experiments suggest that sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-stable Abeta dimers may be the basic building blocks of Alzheimer's disease-associated synaptotoxic assemblies and as such present an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. In the absence of sufficient amounts of highly pure cerebral Abeta dimers, we have used synthetic disulfide cross-linked dimers (free of Abeta monomer or fibrils) to generate conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies. These dimers aggregate to form kinetically trapped protofibrils, but do not readily form fibrils. We identified two antibodies, 3C6 and 4B5, which preferentially bind assemblies formed from covalent Abeta dimers, but do not bind to Abeta monomer, amyloid precursor protein, or aggregates formed by other amyloidogenic proteins. Monoclonal antibody 3C6, but not an IgM isotype-matched control antibody, ameliorated the plasticity-disrupting effects of Abeta extracted from the aqueous phase of Alzheimer's disease brain, thus suggesting that 3C6 targets pathogenically relevant Abeta assemblies. These data prove the usefulness of covalent dimers and their assemblies as immunogens and recommend further investigation of the therapeutic and diagnostic utility of monoclonal antibodies raised to such assemblies.

21782829|t|In vivo and in vitro analyses of toxic mutants of HET-s: FTIR antiparallel signature correlates with amyloid toxicity.
21782829|a|The folding and interactions of amyloid proteins are at the heart of the debate as to how these proteins may or may not become toxic to their host. Although little is known about this issue, the structure seems to be clearly involved with effects on molecular events. To understand how an amyloid may be toxic, we previously generated a yeast toxic amyloid (mutant 8) from the nontoxic HET-s((218-289)) prion domain of Podospora anserina. Here, we performed a comprehensive structure-toxicity study by mutating individually each of the 10 mutations found in mutant 8. The study of the library of new mutants generated allowed us to establish a clear link between Fourier transform infrared antiparallel signature and amyloid toxicity. All of the mutants that form parallel beta-sheets are not toxic. Double mutations may be sufficient to shift a parallel structure to antiparallel amyloids, which are toxic to yeast. Our findings also suggest that the toxicity of antiparallel structured mutants may be linked to interaction with membranes.

21784135|t|H2S releasing aspirin protects amyloid beta induced cell toxicity in BV-2 microglial cells.
21784135|a|beta-Amyloid (Abeta) plaques are characteristic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. In the present study, we examined the neuroprotective effects of S-aspirin, a hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S)-releasing aspirin, on Abeta-induced cell toxicity. 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay showed that S-aspirin, but not aspirin, significantly increased cell viability in BV-2 microglial cells, indicating that S-aspirin may protect cells against injury via releasing H(2)S. S-aspirin at 2.5-10 muM significantly increased cell viability and decreased lactate dehydrogenase release in Abeta-treated BV-2 microglial cells. Western blotting analysis showed that S-aspirin suppressed the protein expression levels of cyclooxygenase-2 and growth arrest DNA damage (GADD). These data suggest that S-aspirin may protect microglial cells by inhibition of Abeta-induced inflammation and cell cycle re-entry. To study whether S-aspirin can protect mitochondria function, mitochondria membrane potential was measured with molecular probe JC-1. It was found that S-aspirin protected mitochondria from Abeta-induced loss of mitochondrial member potential. (DeltaPsim). In addition, S-aspirin also prevented Abeta-induced activation of p38-mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK). In conclusion, our results suggest that S-aspirin may protect microglial injury via inhibition of inflammation, prevention of mitochondria function, and stimulation of cell growth via stimulating p38-MAPK pathway. Our study may suggest that S-aspirin may have potential therapeutic value for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

21784149|t|Chemical characterization of pro-inflammatory amyloid-beta peptides in human atherosclerotic lesions and platelets.
21784149|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides are intimately involved in the inflammatory pathology of atherosclerotic vascular disease (AVD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although substantial amounts of these peptides are produced in the periphery, their role and significance to vascular disease outside the brain requires further investigation. Amyloid-beta peptides present in the walls of human aorta atherosclerotic lesions as well as activated and non-activated human platelets were isolated using sequential size-exclusion columns and HPLC reverse-phase methods. The Abeta peptide isolates were quantified by ELISA and structurally analyzed using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry procedures. Our experiments revealed that both aorta and platelets contained Abeta peptides, predominately Abeta40. The source of the Abeta pool in aortic atherosclerosis lesions is probably the activated platelets and/or vascular wall cells expressing APP/PN2. Significant levels of Abeta42 are present in the plasma, suggesting that this reservoir makes a minor contribution to atherosclerotic plaques. Our data reveal that although aortic atherosclerosis and AD cerebrovascular amyloidosis exhibit clearly divergent end-stage manifestations, both vascular diseases share some key pathophysiological promoting elements and pathways. Whether they happen to be deposited in vessels of the central nervous system or atherosclerotic plaques in the periphery, Abeta peptides may promote and perhaps synergize chronic inflammatory processes which culminate in the degeneration, malfunction and ultimate destruction of arterial walls.

21784348|t|Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities in amyloid-modifying therapeutic trials: recommendations from the Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable Workgroup.
21784348|a|Amyloid imaging related abnormalities (ARIA) have now been reported in clinical trials with multiple therapeutic avenues to lower amyloid-beta burden in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In response to concerns raised by the Food and Drug Administration, the Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable convened a working group to review the publicly available trial data, attempts at developing animal models, and the literature on the natural history and pathology of related conditions. The spectrum of ARIA includes signal hyperintensities on fluid attenuation inversion recoverysequences thought to represent "vasogenic edema" and/or sulcal effusion (ARIA-E), as well as signal hypointensities on GRE/T2* thought to represent hemosiderin deposits (ARIA-H), including microhemorrhage and superficial siderosis. The etiology of ARIA remains unclear but the prevailing data support vascular amyloid as a common pathophysiological mechanism leading to increased vascular permeability. The workgroup proposes recommendations for the detection and monitoring of ARIA in ongoing AD clinical trials, as well as directions for future research.

21784349|t|The Alzheimer's Association external quality control program for cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers.
21784349|a|BACKGROUND: The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers amyloid beta (Abeta)-42, total-tau (T-tau), and phosphorylated-tau (P-tau) demonstrate good diagnostic accuracy for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, there are large variations in biomarker measurements between studies, and between and within laboratories. The Alzheimer's Association has initiated a global quality control program to estimate and monitor variability of measurements, quantify batch-to-batch assay variations, and identify sources of variability. In this article, we present the results from the first two rounds of the program. METHODS: The program is open for laboratories using commercially available kits for Abeta, T-tau, or P-tau. CSF samples (aliquots of pooled CSF) are sent for analysis several times a year from the Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory at the Molndal campus of the University of Gothenburg, Sweden. Each round consists of three quality control samples. RESULTS: Forty laboratories participated. Twenty-six used INNOTEST enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits, 14 used Luminex xMAP with the INNO-BIA AlzBio3 kit (both measure Abeta-(1-42), P-tau(181P), and T-tau), and 5 used Meso Scale Discovery with the Abeta triplex (AbetaN-42, AbetaN-40, and AbetaN-38) or T-tau kits. The total coefficients of variation between the laboratories were 13% to 36%. Five laboratories analyzed the samples six times on different occasions. Within-laboratory precisions differed considerably between biomarkers within individual laboratories. CONCLUSIONS: Measurements of CSF AD biomarkers show large between-laboratory variability, likely caused by factors related to analytical procedures and the analytical kits. Standardization of laboratory procedures and efforts by kit vendors to increase kit performance might lower variability, and will likely increase the usefulness of CSF AD biomarkers.

21784357|t|How golden is the gold standard of neuropathology in dementia?
21784357|a|Current Alzheimer's disease (AD) criteria state that a definite diagnosis can only be made by postmortem examination. The neuropathological confirmation is often referred to as the "gold standard." In this article, we review what constitutes a gold standard and how the neuropathological examination of AD lives up to that standard. We conclude that there is no evidence for this notion because results between different laboratories differ to an important extent, especially when the clinical picture is in doubt, for example, when the dementia is mild. As an alternative, we propose to abandon thinking in standards and value neuropathology as any other biomarker, and to strive to use and integrate multiple sources of information to make the diagnosis of AD in all its complexity.

21787313|a|In the present review, we summarize the current achievements of modelling early intraneuronal Abeta (amyloid beta-peptide) accumulation in transgenic mice with the resulting pathological consequences. Of special importance will be to discuss recent developments and the translation of the results to AD (Alzheimer's disease). N-terminally truncated AbetapE3 (Abeta starting with pyroglutamate at position 3) represents a major fraction of all Abeta peptides in the brain of AD patients. Recently, we generated a novel mAb (monoclonal antibody), 9D5, that selectively recognizes oligomeric assemblies of AbetapE3 and demonstrated the potential involvement of oligomeric AbetapE3 in vivo using transgenic mouse models as well as human brains from sporadic and familial AD cases. 9D5 showed an unusual staining pattern with almost non-detectable plaques in sporadic AD patients and non-demented controls. Interestingly, in sporadic and familial AD cases prominent intraneuronal staining was observed. Moreover, passive immunization of 5XFAD mice with 9D5 significantly reduced overall Abeta levels and stabilized behavioural deficits. In summary, we have demonstrated that intraneuronal Abeta is a valid risk factor in model systems and AD patients. This feature of AD pathology was successful in identifying novel low-molecular-mass oligomeric Abeta-specific antibodies for diagnosis and therapy.

21790829|t|The PKR activator PACT is induced by Abeta: involvement in Alzheimer's disease.
21790829|a|The neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) include senile plaques made of Abeta peptide, neurofibrillary tangles containing hyperphosphorylated tau protein and neuronal loss. The pro-apoptotic kinase PKR can be activated by Abeta and can phosphorylate tau protein via GSK3beta kinase activation. The activated form of PKR (pPKR) accumulates in affected neurons and could participate in neuronal degeneration in AD. The mechanism of abnormal PKR activation in AD is not elucidated but could be linked to the PKR activator PACT. PACT stainings, and levels were assessed in the brains of AD patients and in APP/PS1 knock-in transgenic mice and in cell cultures exposed to stresses. We showed that PACT and pPKR colocalizations are enhanced in AD brains. Their levels are increased and correlated in AD and APP/PS1 knock-in mice brains. In human neuroblastoma cells exposed to Abeta, tunicamycin or H2O2, PACT and pPKR concentrations are increased. PACT then PKR inhibitions indicate that PACT is upstream of PKR activation. Our findings demonstrate that PACT levels are enhanced in AD brains and could partly be caused by the action of Abeta. In addition, PACT participates in PKR activation. The PACT-PKR pathway represents a potential link between Abeta accumulation, PKR activation and tau phosphorylation.

21793568|t|In situ measurements of the formation and morphology of intracellular beta-amyloid fibrils by super-resolution fluorescence imaging.
21793568|a|Misfolding and aggregation of peptides and proteins is a characteristic of many neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) aggregates to form characteristic fibrillar structures, which are the deposits found as plaques in the brains of patients. We have used direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy, dSTORM, to probe the process of in situ Abeta aggregation and the morphology of the ensuing aggregates with a resolution better than 20 nm. We are able to distinguish different types of structures, including oligomeric assemblies and mature fibrils, and observe a number of morphological differences between the species formed in vitro and in vivo, which may be significant in the context of disease. Our data support the recent view that intracellular Abeta could be associated with Abeta pathogenicity in AD, although the major deposits are extracellular, and suggest that this approach will be widely applicable to studies of the molecular mechanisms of protein deposition diseases.

21795536|t|LRAD3, a novel low-density lipoprotein receptor family member that modulates amyloid precursor protein trafficking.
21795536|a|We have identified a novel low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family member, termed LDL receptor class A domain containing 3 (LRAD3), which is expressed in neurons. The LRAD3 gene encodes an ~50 kDa type I transmembrane receptor with an ectodomain containing three LDLa repeats, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain containing a conserved dileucine internalization motif and two polyproline motifs with potential to interact with WW-domain-containing proteins. Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse brain reveals LRAD3 expression in the cortex and hippocampus. In the mouse hippocampal-derived cell line HT22, LRAD3 partially colocalizes with amyloid precursor protein (APP) and interacts with APP as revealed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. To identify the portion of APP that interacts with LRAD3, we used solid-phase binding assays that demonstrated that LRAD3 failed to bind to a soluble APP fragment (sAPPalpha) released after alpha-secretase cleavage. In contrast, C99, the beta-secretase product that remains cell associated, coprecipitated with LRAD3, confirming that regions within this portion of APP are important for associating with LRAD3. The association of LRAD3 with APP increases the amyloidogenic pathway of APP processing, resulting in a decrease in sAPPalpha production and increased Abeta peptide production. Pulse-chase experiments confirm that LRAD3 expression significantly decreases the cellular half-life of mature APP. These results reveal that LRAD3 influences APP processing and raises the possibility that LRAD3 alters APP function in neurons, including its downstream signaling.

21795660|t|A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of simvastatin to treat Alzheimer disease.
21795660|a|BACKGROUND: Lowering cholesterol is associated with reduced CNS amyloid deposition and increased dietary cholesterol increases amyloid accumulation in animal studies. Epidemiologic data suggest that use of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) may decrease the risk of Alzheimer disease (AD) and a single-site trial suggested possible benefit in cognition with statin treatment in AD, supporting the hypothesis that statin therapy is useful in the treatment of AD. OBJECTIVE: To determine if the lipid-lowering agent simvastatin slows the progression of symptoms in AD. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of simvastatin was conducted in individuals with mild to moderate AD and normal lipid levels. Participants were randomly assigned to receive simvastatin, 20 mg/day, for 6 weeks then 40 mg per day for the remainder of 18 months or identical placebo. The primary outcome was the rate of change in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive portion (ADAS-Cog). Secondary outcomes measured clinical global change, cognition, function, and behavior. RESULTS: A total of 406 individuals were randomized: 204 to simvastatin and 202 to placebo. Simvastatin lowered lipid levels but had no effect on change in ADAS-Cog score or the secondary outcome measures. There was no evidence of increased adverse events with simvastatin treatment. CONCLUSION: Simvastatin had no benefit on the progression of symptoms in individuals with mild to moderate AD despite significant lowering of cholesterol. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class I evidence that simvastatin 40 mg/day does not slow decline on the ADAS-Cog.

21795680|t|Prion protein interacts with BACE1 protein and differentially regulates its activity toward wild type and Swedish mutant amyloid precursor protein.
21795680|a|In Alzheimer disease amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) accumulate in the brain. Cleavage of APP by the beta-secretase BACE1 is the rate-limiting step in the production of Abeta. We have reported previously that the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) inhibited the action of BACE1 toward human wild type APP (APP(WT)) in cellular models and that the levels of endogenous murine Abeta were significantly increased in PrP(C)-null mouse brain. Here we investigated the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying this observation. PrP(C) interacted directly with the prodomain of the immature Golgi-localized form of BACE1. This interaction decreased BACE1 at the cell surface and in endosomes where it preferentially cleaves APP(WT) but increased it in the Golgi where it preferentially cleaves APP with the Swedish mutation (APP(Swe)). In transgenic mice expressing human APP with the Swedish and Indiana familial mutations (APP(Swe,Ind)), PrP(C) deletion had no influence on APP proteolytic processing, Abeta plaque deposition, or levels of soluble Abeta or Abeta oligomers. In cells, although PrP(C) inhibited the action of BACE1 on APP(WT), it did not inhibit BACE1 activity toward APP(Swe). The differential subcellular location of the BACE1 cleavage of APP(Swe) relative to APP(WT) provides an explanation for the failure of PrP(C) deletion to affect Abeta accumulation in APP(Swe,Ind) mice. Thus, although PrP(C) exerts no control on cleavage of APP(Swe) by BACE1, it has a profound influence on the cleavage of APP(WT), suggesting that PrP(C) may be a key protective player against sporadic Alzheimer disease.

21795681|t|Beta-amyloid peptide variants in brains and cerebrospinal fluid from amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice: comparison with human Alzheimer amyloid.
21795681|a|In this study, we report a detailed analysis of the different variants of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides in the brains and the cerebrospinal fluid from APP23 transgenic mice, expressing amyloid precursor protein with the Swedish familial Alzheimer disease mutation, at different ages. Using one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, immunoblotting, and mass spectrometry, we identified the Abeta peptides Abeta(1-40), -(1-42), -(1-39), -(1-38), -(1-37), -(2-40), and -(3-40) as well as minor amounts of pyroglutamate-modified Abeta (Abeta(N3pE)) and endogenous murine Abeta in brains from 24-month-old mice. Chemical modifications of the N-terminal amino group of Abeta were identified that had clearly been introduced during standard experimental procedures. To address this issue, we additionally applied amyloid extraction in ultrapure water. Clear differences between APP23 mice and Alzheimer disease (AD) brain samples were observed in terms of the relative abundance of specific variants of Abeta peptides, such as Abeta(N3pE), Abeta(1-42), and N-terminally truncated Abeta(2/3-42). These differences to human AD amyloid were also noticed in a related mouse line transgenic for human wild type amyloid precursor protein. Taken together, our findings suggest different underlying molecular mechanisms driving the amyloid deposition in transgenic mice and AD patients.

21797254|t|Homogeneous and heterogeneous tertiary structure ensembles of amyloid-beta peptides.
21797254|a|The interplay of modern molecular simulation and high-quality nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments has reached a fruitful stage for quantitative characterization of structural ensembles of disordered peptides. Amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta42), the primary peptide associated with Alzheimer's disease, and fragments such as Abeta21-30 are both classified as intrinsically disordered peptides (IDPs). We use a variety of NMR observables to validate de novo molecular dynamics simulations in explicit water to characterize the tertiary structure ensemble of Abeta42 and Abeta21-30 from the perspective of their classification as IDPs. Unlike the Abeta21-30 fragment that conforms to expectations of an IDP that is primarily extended, we find that Abeta42 samples conformations reflecting all possible secondary structure categories and spans the range of IDP classifications from collapsed structured states to highly extended conformations, making it an IDP with a far more heterogeneous tertiary ensemble.

21798242|t|Wnt/beta-catenin signal pathway stabilizes APP intracellular domain (AICD) and promotes its transcriptional activity.
21798242|a|Amyloid precursor protein (APP), a key protein in pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), is a type I transmembrane protein which can be cleaved by beta- and gamma-secretase to release the amyloidogenic beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta) and the APP intracellular domain (AICD). While Abeta has been widely believed to initiate pathogenic cascades culminating AD, the physiological functions and regulations of AICD remain elusive. In present study, endogenous AICD was demonstrated to be increased by canonical Wnt signal. Instead of due to gamma-secretase activity, enhanced AICD expression was found due to the increased protein stability by Wnt/beta-catenin. beta-Catenin was demonstrated to be an associating partner of AICD, capable of promoting AICD mediated transcriptional activity. Investigation by AICD mutants proved that Fe65, a previously identified AICD binding partner, is not involved in this regulation. Taken together, our results suggest that AICD is stabilized and the AICD mediated transcriptional activity is promoted by canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling independent of Fe65.

21802289|t|Novel imaging agents for beta-amyloid plaque based on the N-benzoylindole core.
21802289|a|We report the synthesis and evaluation of a series of N-benzoylindole derivatives as novel potential imaging agents for beta-amyloid plaques. In vitro binding studies using Abeta(1-40) aggregates versus [(125)I]TZDM showed that all these derivatives demonstrated high binding affinities (K(i) values ranged from 8.4 to 121.6 nM). Moreover, two radioiodinated compounds [(125)I]7 and [(125)I]14 were prepared. Autoradiography for [(125)I]14 displayed intense and specific labeling of Abeta plaques in the brain sections of AD model mice (C57, APP/PS1) with low background. In vivo biodistribution in normal mice exhibited sufficient initial brain uptake for imaging (2.19% and 2.00%ID/g at 2 min postinjection for [(125)I]7 and [(125)I]14, respectively). Although additional modifications are necessary to improve brain uptake and clearance from the brain, the N-benzoylindole may be served as a backbone structure to develop novel beta-amyloid imaging probes.

21802369|t|Neuropathologically defined subtypes of Alzheimer's disease with distinct clinical characteristics: a retrospective study.
21802369|a|BACKGROUND: Neurofibrillary pathology has a stereotypical progression in Alzheimer's disease (AD) that is encapsulated in the Braak staging scheme; however, some AD cases are atypical and do not fit into this scheme. We aimed to compare clinical and neuropathological features between typical and atypical AD cases. METHODS: AD cases with a Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage of more than IV were identified from a brain bank database. By use of thioflavin-S fluorescence microscopy, we assessed the density and the distribution of neurofibrillary tangles in three cortical regions and two hippocampal sectors. These data were used to construct an algorithm to classify AD cases into typical, hippocampal sparing, or limbic predominant. Classified cases were then compared for clinical, demographic, pathological, and genetic characteristics. An independent cohort of AD cases was assessed to validate findings from the initial cohort. FINDINGS: 889 cases of AD, 398 men and 491 women with age at death of 37-103 years, were classified with the algorithm as hippocampal sparing (97 cases [11%]), typical (665 [75%]), or limbic predominant (127 [14%]). By comparison with typical AD, neurofibrillary tangle counts per 0.125 mm(2) in hippocampal sparing cases were higher in cortical areas (median 13, IQR 11-16) and lower in the hippocampus (7.5, 5.2-9.5), whereas counts in limbic-predominant cases were lower in cortical areas (4.3, 3.0-5.7) and higher in the hippocampus (27, 22-35). Hippocampal sparing cases had less hippocampal atrophy than did typical and limbic-predominant cases. Patients with hippocampal sparing AD were younger at death (mean 72 years [SD 10]) and a higher proportion of them were men (61 [63%]), whereas those with limbic-predominant AD were older (mean 86 years [SD 6]) and a higher proportion of them were women (87 [69%]). Microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) H1H1 genotype was more common in limbic-predominant AD (54 [70%]) than in hippocampal sparing AD (24 [46%]; p=0.011), but did not differ significantly between limbic-predominant and typical AD (204 [59%]; p=0.11). Apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 allele status differed between AD subtypes only when data were stratified by age at onset. Clinical presentation, age at onset, disease duration, and rate of cognitive decline differed between the AD subtypes. These findings were confirmed in a validation cohort of 113 patients with AD. INTERPRETATION: These data support the hypothesis that AD has distinct clinicopathological subtypes. Hippocampal sparing and limbic-predominant AD subtypes might account for about 25% of cases, and hence should be considered when designing clinical, genetic, biomarker, and treatment studies in patients with AD.

21803450|t|The APP intracellular domain (AICD) potentiates ER stress-induced apoptosis.
21803450|a|Here we employed human SHEP neuroblastoma cells either stably or inducibly expressing the amyloid precursor protein (APP) intracellular domain (AICD) to investigate its ability to modulate stress-induced cell death. Analysis of effector caspase activation revealed that AICD overexpression was specifically associated with an increased sensitivity to apoptosis induced by the 2 endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stressors thapsigargin and tunicamycin, but not by staurosporine (STS). Basal and ER stress-induced expression of Bip/Grp78 and C/EBP-homologous protein/GADD153 were not altered by AICD implying that AICD potentiated cell death downstream or independent of the conserved unfolded protein response (UPR). Interestingly, quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis and reporter gene assays revealed that AICD significantly downregulated messenger RNA levels of the Alzheimer's disease susceptibility gene ApoJ/clusterin, indicating transcriptional repression. Knockdown of ApoJ/clusterin mimicked the effect of AICD on ER stress-induced apoptosis, but had no discernible effect on staurosporine-induced cell death. Our data suggest that altered levels of AICD may abolish the prosurvival function of ApoJ/clusterin and increase the susceptibility of neurons to ER stress-mediated cell death, a pathway that may contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

21804535|t|Amyloid-beta forms fibrils by nucleated conformational conversion of oligomers.
21804535|a|Amyloid-beta amyloidogenesis is reported to occur via a nucleated polymerization mechanism. If this is true, the energetically unfavorable oligomeric nucleus should be very hard to detect. However, many laboratories have detected early nonfibrillar amyloid-beta oligomers without observing amyloid fibrils, suggesting that a mechanistic revision may be needed. Here we introduce Cys-Cys-amyloid-beta(1-40), which cannot bind to the latent fluorophore FlAsH as a monomer, but can bind FlAsH as an nonfibrillar oligomer or as a fibril, rendering the conjugates fluorescent. Through FlAsH monitoring of Cys-Cys-amyloid-beta(1-40) aggregation, we found that amyloid-beta(1-40) rapidly and efficiently forms spherical oligomers in vitro (85% yield) that are kinetically competent to slowly convert to amyloid fibrils by a nucleated conformational conversion mechanism. This methodology was used to show that plasmalogen ethanolamine vesicles eliminate the proteotoxicity-associated oligomerization phase of amyloid-beta amyloidogenesis while allowing fibril formation, rationalizing how low concentrations of plasmalogen ethanolamine in the brain are epidemiologically linked to Alzheimer's disease.

21805181|t|Factors affecting Abeta plasma levels and their utility as biomarkers in ADNI.
21805181|a|Previous studies of Abeta plasma as a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD) obtained conflicting results. We here included 715 subjects with baseline Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) plasma measurement (50% with 4 serial annual measurements): 205 cognitively normal controls (CN), 348 patients mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 162 with AD. We assessed the factors that modified their concentrations and correlated these values with PIB PET, MRI and tau and Abeta(1-42) measures in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Association between Abeta and diagnosis (baseline and prospective) was assessed. A number of health conditions were associated with altered concentrations of plasma Abeta. The effect of age differed according to AD stage. Plasma Abeta(1-42) showed mild correlation with other biomarkers of Abeta pathology and were associated with infarctions in MRI. Longitudinal measurements of Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) plasma levels showed modest value as a prognostic factor for clinical progression. Our longitudinal study of complementary measures of Abeta pathology (PIB, CSF and plasma Abeta) and other biomarkers in a cohort with an extensive neuropsychological battery is significant because it shows that plasma Abeta measurements have limited value for disease classification and modest value as prognostic factors over the 3-year follow-up. However, with longer follow-up, within subject plasma Abeta measurements could be used as a simple and minimally invasive screen to identify those at increased risk for AD. Our study emphasizes the need for a better understanding of the biology and dynamics of plasma Abeta as well as the need for longer term studies to determine the clinical utility of measuring plasma Abeta.

21805327|t|Probucol suppresses enterocytic accumulation of amyloid-beta induced by saturated fat and cholesterol feeding.
21805327|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) is secreted from lipogenic organs such as intestine and liver as an apolipoprotein of nascent triacylglycerol rich lipoproteins. Chronically elevated plasma Abeta may compromise cerebrovascular integrity and exacerbate amyloidosis--a hallmark feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Probucol is a hypocholesterolemic agent that reduces amyloid burden in transgenic amyloid mice, but the mechanisms for this effect are presently unclear. In this study, the effect of Probucol on intestinal lipoprotein-Abeta homeostasis was explored. Wild-type mice were fed a control low-fat diet and enterocytic Abeta was stimulated by high-fat (HF) diet enriched in 10% (w/w) saturated fat and 1% (w/w) cholesterol for the duration of 1 month. Mice treated with Probucol had the drug incorporated into the chow at 1% (w/w). Quantitative immunofluorescence was utilised to determine intestinal apolipoprotein B (apo B) and Abeta abundance. We found apo B in both the perinuclear region of the enterocytes and the lacteals in all groups. However, HF feeding and Probucol treatment increased secretion of apo B into the lacteals without any change in net villi abundance. On the other hand, HF-induced enterocytic perinuclear Abeta was significantly attenuated by Probucol. No significant changes in Abeta were observed within the lacteals. The findings of this study support the notion that Probucol suppresses dietary fat induced stimulation of Abeta biosynthesis and attenuate availability of apo B lipoprotein-Abeta for secretion.

21806809|a|BACKGROUND: Numerous pre-clinical studies and clinical trials demonstrated that induction of antibodies to the beta-amyloid peptide of 42 residues (Abeta42) elicits therapeutic effects in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, an active vaccination strategy based on full length Abeta42 is currently hampered by elicitation of T cell pathological autoreactivity. We attempt to improve vaccine efficacy by creating a novel chimeric flu vaccine expressing the small immunodominant B cell epitope of Abeta42. We hypothesized that in elderly people with pre-existing memory Th cells specific to influenza this dual vaccine will simultaneously boost anti-influenza immunity and induce production of therapeutically active anti-Abeta antibodies. METHODS: Plasmid-based reverse genetics system was used for the rescue of recombinant influenza virus containing immunodominant B cell epitopes of Abeta42 (Abeta1-7/10). RESULTS: Two chimeric flu viruses expressing either 7 or 10 aa of Abeta42 (flu-Abeta1-7 or flu-Abeta1-10) were generated and tested in mice as conventional inactivated vaccines. We demonstrated that this dual vaccine induced therapeutically potent anti-Abeta antibodies and anti-influenza antibodies in mice. CONCLUSION: We suggest that this strategy might be beneficial for treatment of AD patients as well as for prevention of development of AD pathology in pre-symptomatic individuals while concurrently boosting immunity against influenza.

21807072|t|Pre-aggregated Abeta(25-35) alters arginine metabolism in the rat hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.
21807072|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) has been proposed to play a central and causative role in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Abeta(25-35), the neurotoxic domain of the full-length Abeta, causes learning and memory impairments in rodents. The present study investigated the effects of a single bilateral i.c.v. infusion of pre-aggregated Abeta(25-35) (30 nmol/rat) on animals' performance in the open field, and on arginine metabolic enzymes and metabolites in the CA1, CA2/3, and dentate gyrus (DG) sub-regions of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) at the time point of 6-8 days after Abeta infusion. Abeta(25-35) rats displayed reduced exploratory activity in the open field relative to the Abeta(35-25) (reverse peptide; 30 nmol) rats. Abeta(25-35) resulted in significantly decreased nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity and endothelial NOS protein expression, but increased arginase activity, arginase II protein expression, and ornithine and putrescine levels, in hippocampal CA2/3. There were increased glutamate and putrescine levels in the DG, but decreased agmatine levels in the DG and PFC, in the Abeta(25-35) group relative to the Abeta(35-25) one. Cluster analyses were performed to determine if the nine related neurochemical variables (arginine, citrulline, ornithine, agmatine, putrescine, spermidine, spemine, glutamate, and GABA) formed distinct groups, and whether it changed as a function of Abeta(25-35). There were substantially different clusters between the two groups in the hippocampus and PFC. These results demonstrate that Abeta(25-35) alters arginine metabolism, which further supports the prominent role of arginine and its metabolites in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis.

21807097|t|Synaptic dysfunction in hippocampus of transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease: a multi-electrode array study.
21807097|a|APP.V717I and Tau.P301L transgenic mice develop Alzheimer's disease pathology comprising important aspects of human disease including increased levels of amyloid peptides, cognitive and motor impairment, amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The combined model, APP.V717IxTau.P301L bigenic mice (biAT mice) exhibit aggravated amyloid and tau pathology with severe cognitive and behavioral defects. In the present study, we investigated early changes in synaptic function in the CA1 and CA3 regions of acute hippocampal slices of young APP.V717I, Tau.P301L and biAT transgenic animals. We have used planar multi-electrode arrays (MEA) and improved methods for simultaneous multi-site recordings from two hippocampal sub-regions. In the CA1 region, long-term potentiation (LTP) was severely impaired in all transgenic animals when compared with age-matched wild-type controls, while basal synaptic transmission and paired-pulse facilitation were minimally affected. In the CA3 region, LTP was normal in Tau.P301L and APP.V717I but clearly impaired in biAT mice. Surprisingly, frequency facilitation in CA3 was significantly enhanced in Tau.P301L mice, while not affected in APP.V717I mice and depressed in biAT mice. The findings demonstrate important synaptic changes that differ considerably in the hippocampal sub-regions already at young age, well before the typical amyloid or tau pathology is evident.

21810407|t|Nanoscale structural and mechanical effects of beta-amyloid (1-42) on polymer cushioned membranes: a combined study by neutron reflectometry and AFM Force Spectroscopy.
21810407|a|The interaction of beta-amyloid peptides with lipid membranes is widely studied as trigger agents in Alzheimer's disease. Their mechanism of action at the molecular level is unknown and their interaction with the neural membrane is crucial to elucidate the onset of the disease. In this study we have investigated the interaction of water soluble forms of beta-amyloid Abeta(1-42) with lipid bilayers supported by polymer cushion. A reproducible protocol for the preparation of a supported phospholipid membrane with composition mimicking the neural membrane and in physiological condition (PBS buffer, pH=7.4) was refined by neutron reflectivity. The change in structure and local mechanical properties of the membrane in the presence of Abeta(1-42) was investigated by neutron reflectivity and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) Force Spectroscopy. Neutron reflectivity evidenced that Abeta(1-42) interacts strongly with the supported membrane, causing a change in the scattering length density profile of the lipid bilayer, and penetrates into the membrane. Concomitantly, the local mechanical properties of the bilayer are deeply modified by the interaction with the peptide as seen by AFM Force Spectroscopy. These results may be of great importance for the onset of the Alzheimer's disease, since a simultaneous change in the structural and mechanical properties of the lipid matrix could influence all membrane based signal cascades.

21812329|t|Protein L-isoaspartyl O-methyltransferase inhibits amyloid beta fibrillogenesis in vitro.
21812329|a|Fibrillar aggregates of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) are major constituents of the senile plaques found in the brains of patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous studies have shown that spontaneous isomerization or racemization of aspartyl residues in Abeta peptides leads to conformational changes in the secondary structure and increased aggregative ability of the peptides. Protein L-isoaspartyl O-methyltransferase (PIMT, EC 2.1.1.77) is a repairing enzyme converting L-isoaspartyl/D-aspartyl residues in damaged proteins to normal L-aspartyl residues. In this study it was investigated, whether PIMT is able to modulate Abeta fibrillogenesis in vitro by methylation of isoaspartyl residue using purified 5Abeta and PIMT. A Thioflavin-T (Th-T) binding assay conducted after aging Abeta in vitro (37 degrees C, pH 7.4 in PBS) revealed that PIMT inhibited the increase of fluorescence caused by amyloid fibrillogenesis. Western blot analysis revealed that high molecular Abeta aggregates (> 200 kDa) only occurred during Abeta incubation, while they were reduced in response to incubation with PIMT and AdoMet. Additionally, circular dichroism (CD) showed that the beta-sheet structure was increased in Abeta peptides in a time-dependent fashion, while PIMT suppressed the beta-sheet transition after 24 h. Finally, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that PIMT reduced the size of the Abeta aggregates and induced a different pathway, leading to the formation of amorphous structures. Taken together, these findings indicate that isoaspartyl methylation leads to partial blockade of fibrillogenesis of Abeta by inhibiting the beta transition in the Abeta peptide.

21812781|t|The Swedish APP mutation alters the effect of genetically reduced BACE1 expression on the APP processing.
21812781|a|Inhibition of beta-secretase (BACE1) is a key therapeutic approach in Alzheimer's disease (AD), as BACE1 initiates amyloid-beta (Abeta) cleavage from the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP). As Abeta reductions in mice lacking one BACE1 allele diverged considerably between studies we investigated the effect of BACE1 knock-out in more detail. With both BACE1 alleles the Swedish mutation (APP23 mice) increased APP processing and shifted it towards the beta-secretase pathway as compared with non-mutated APP expressed at a similar level (APP51/16 mice). This effect was much smaller then observed in cell culture. An about 50% decrease in BACE1 enzyme activity resulted in a sub-proportional Abeta reduction with the Swedish mutation (-20%) and even less for non-mutated APP (-16%). In wild-type mice, the Abeta reduction may be even further diminished. Other metabolites of the beta-secretase pathway decreased accordingly while the alternative alpha-secretase pathway increased. Complete BACE1 deletion strongly enhanced these changes. The remaining Abeta signal also described by others can be explained by assay cross-reactivity with other APP metabolites supporting BACE1 as the major beta-secretase. Our data indicate that BACE1 is in excess over APP at the cleavage site(s). Alterations in APP expression or substrate properties, therefore, quantitatively change its cleavage and Abeta generation.

21813640|t|Structural basis for matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2)-selective inhibitory action of beta-amyloid precursor protein-derived inhibitor.
21813640|a|Unlike other synthetic or physiological inhibitors for matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), the beta-amyloid precursor protein-derived inhibitory peptide (APP-IP) having an ISYGNDALMP sequence has a high selectivity toward MMP-2. Our previous study identified amino acid residues of MMP-2 essential for its selective inhibition by APP-IP and demonstrated that the N to C direction of the decapeptide inhibitor relative to the substrate-binding cleft of MMP-2 is opposite that of substrate. However, detailed interactions between the two molecules remained to be clarified. Here, we determined the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of MMP-2 in complex with APP-IP. We found that APP-IP in the complex is indeed embedded into the substrate-binding cleft of the catalytic domain in the N to C direction opposite that of substrate. With the crystal structure, it was first clarified that the aromatic side chain of Tyr(3) of the inhibitor is accommodated into the S1' pocket of the protease, and the carboxylate group of Asp(6) of APP-IP coordinates bidentately to the catalytic zinc of the enzyme. The Ala(7) to Pro(10) and Tyr(3) to Ile(1) strands of the inhibitor extend into the nonprime and the prime sides of the cleft, respectively. Therefore, the decapeptide inhibitor has long range contact with the substrate-binding cleft of the protease. This mode of interaction is probably essential for the high MMP-2 selectivity of the inhibitor because MMPs share a common architecture in the vicinity of the catalytic center, but whole structures of their substrate-binding clefts have sufficient variety for the inhibitor to distinguish MMP-2 from other MMPs.

21813677|t|Distinct and non-redundant roles of microglia and myeloid subsets in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.
21813677|a|Mononuclear phagocytes are important modulators of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the specific functions of resident microglia, bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells, and perivascular macrophages have not been resolved. To elucidate the spatiotemporal roles of mononuclear phagocytes during disease, we targeted myeloid cell subsets from different compartments and examined disease pathogenesis in three different mouse models of AD (APP(swe/PS1), APP(swe), and APP23 mice). We identified chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)-expressing myeloid cells as the population that was preferentially recruited to beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposits. Unexpectedly, AD brains with dysfunctional microglia and devoid of parenchymal bone marrow-derived phagocytes did not show overt changes in plaque pathology and Abeta load. In contrast, restriction of CCR2 deficiency to perivascular myeloid cells drastically impaired beta-amyloid clearance and amplified vascular Abeta deposition, while parenchymal plaque deposition remained unaffected. Together, our data advocate selective functions of CCR2-expressing myeloid subsets, which could be targeted specifically to modify disease burden in AD.

21813680|t|Effects of brain amyloid deposition and reduced glucose metabolism on the default mode of brain function in normal aging.
21813680|a|Brain beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition during normal aging is highlighted as an initial pathogenetic event in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Many recent brain imaging studies have focused on areas deactivated during cognitive tasks [the default mode network (DMN), i.e., medial frontal gyrus/anterior cingulate cortex and precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex], where the strength of functional coordination was more or less affected by cerebral Abeta deposits. In the present positron emission tomography study, to investigate whether regional glucose metabolic alterations and Abeta deposits seen in nondemented elderly human subjects (n = 22) are of pathophysiological importance in changes of brain hemodynamic coordination in DMN during normal aging, we measured cerebral glucose metabolism with [(18)F]FDG, Abeta deposits with [(11)C]PIB, and regional cerebral blood flow during control and working memory tasks by H(2)(15)O on the same day. Data were analyzed using both region of interest and statistical parametric mapping. Our results indicated that the amount of Abeta deposits was negatively correlated with hemodynamic similarity between medial frontal and medial posterior regions, and the lower similarity was associated with poorer working memory performance. In contrast, brain glucose metabolism was not related to this medial hemodynamic similarity. These findings suggest that traceable Abeta deposition, but not glucose hypometabolism, in the brain plays an important role in occurrence of neuronal discoordination in DMN along with poor working memory in healthy elderly people.

21813692|t|Opposing synaptic regulation of amyloid-beta metabolism by NMDA receptors in vivo.
21813692|a|The concentration of amyloid-beta (Abeta) within the brain extracellular space is one determinant of whether the peptide will aggregate into toxic species that are important in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Some types of synaptic activity can regulate Abeta levels. Here we demonstrate two distinct mechanisms that are simultaneously activated by NMDA receptors and regulate brain interstitial fluid (ISF) Abeta levels in opposite directions in the living mouse. Depending on the dose of NMDA administered locally to the brain, ISF Abeta levels either increase or decrease. Low doses of NMDA increase action potentials and synaptic transmission which leads to an elevation in synaptic Abeta generation. In contrast, high doses of NMDA activate signaling pathways that lead to ERK (extracellular-regulated kinase) activation, which reduces processing of APP into Abeta. This depression in Abeta via APP processing occurs despite dramatically elevated synaptic activity. Both of these synaptic mechanisms are simultaneously active, with the balance between them determining whether ISF Abeta levels will increase or decrease. NMDA receptor antagonists increase ISF Abeta levels, suggesting that basal activity at these receptors normally suppresses Abeta levels in vivo. This has implications for understanding normal Abeta metabolism as well as AD pathogenesis.

21820649|t|Ibuprofen and lipoic acid codrug 1 control Alzheimer's disease progression by down-regulating protein kinase C epsilon-mediated metalloproteinase 2 and 9 levels in beta-amyloid infused Alzheimer's disease rat model.
21820649|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) commonly begins with loss of recent memory and is associated to pathological and histological hallmarks such as beta amyloid plaques, neural tangles (NFT), cholinergic deficit, extensive neuronal loss and synaptic changes in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The amyloid cascade hypothesis implies the activity of beta, gamma secretases which mediate the cleavage of APP (Amyloid Precursor Protein), the formation of amyloidogenic Abeta fragment (1-42), which compacts into amyloid plaques, while the cleavage by alpha secretase of APP, within the Abeta segment (non-amyloidogenic processing) forms sAPP and prevents the formation of Abeta. Among the proteases which have Abeta-degrading activity, Metalloproteinase (MMP) 2, disclosing beta secretase-like activity, is included, while MMP9 seems to contribute to neuronal death. In addition, since intracellular signaling protein kinase C (PKC) can control either directly alpha secretase or indirectly through regulation of ERK1/2, preventing the formation of beta amyloid, created by beta and gamma secretase, and prolonging the life span of Alzheimer's disease mutant mice, here we show the effects exerted by new codrug 1 on PKC epsilon-mediated MMP2 and MMP9 levels regulation in Abeta (1-40) infused rat cerebral cortex. Interestingly codrug 1, lowering metalloproteinases expression via PKC epsilon down-modulation, seems to control Alzheimer's disease induced cerebral amyloid deposits, neuronal death and, lastly, behavioral deterioration.

21821316|t|Blood pressure is associated with higher brain amyloid burden and lower glucose metabolism in healthy late middle-age persons.
21821316|a|Epidemiological studies suggest that elevated blood pressure (BP) in midlife is associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in late life. In this preliminary study, we investigated the extent to which BP measurements are related to positron emission tomography (PET) measurements of fibrillar amyloid-beta burden using Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB) and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET measures of cerebral metabolic rate for glucose metabolism (CMRgl) in cognitively normal, late middle-aged to older adult apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 homozygotes, heterozygotes and noncarriers. PiB PET results revealed that systolic BP (SBP) and pulse pressure (PP) were each positively correlated with cerebral-to-cerebellar PiB distribution volume ratio (DVR) in frontal, temporal, and posterior-cingulate/precuneus regions, whereas no significant positive correlations were found between PiB distribution volume ratios and diastolic BP (DBP). FDG PET results revealed significant inverse correlations between each of the BP measures and lower glucose metabolism in frontal and temporal brain regions. These preliminary findings provide additional evidence that higher BP, likely a reflection of arterial stiffness, during late midlife may be associated with increased risk of presymptomatic AD.

21821948|t|Identification of novel short peptide inhibitors of soluble 37/48 kDa oligomers of amyloid beta42.
21821948|a|Since the soluble oligomers of 42-residue amyloid beta (Abeta42) might be neurotoxins at an early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), inhibition of soluble Abeta42 oligomerization should be effective in the treatment of AD. We have found by phage display that a 7-residue peptide, SRPGLRR, exhibited inhibitory activity against soluble 37/48 kDa oligomers of Abeta42. In the present study, we newly prepared 3- and 4-residue random peptides libraries and performed pannings of them against soluble Abeta42 to search for important factors in the inhibition of Abeta42 oligomerization. After the fifth round, arginine-containing peptides were enriched in both libraries. SDS-PAGE and size-exclusion chromatography indicated that the inhibitory activities of 4-residue peptides against the soluble 37/48 kDa oligomers of Abeta42 were higher than those of the 3-residue peptides, and RFRK exhibited strong inhibitory activity as well as SRPGLRR. These short peptides should be useful for the suppression of soluble Abeta42 oligomer formation.

21822699|t|Atypical presentation of a novel Presenilin 1 R377W mutation: sporadic, late-onset Alzheimer disease with epilepsy and frontotemporal atrophy.
21822699|a|Mutations within Presenilin 1 (PSEN1) represent the most common cause of monogenic Alzheimer Disease (AD). The clinical phenotype is highly variable, even if early onset disease with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and presenting memory deficits usually occur. In the present work, we described the case of a late-onset AD patient, without any positive family history for dementia, and associated with seizures and behavioural symptoms. Structural and functional neuroimaging showed frontotemporal changes without posterior biparietal brain abnormalities. Cerebrospinal analysis was consistent with AD pattern, with decreased Abeta42 and increased Tau and phospho-Tau. A novel pathogenetic mutation within PSEN1 gene was detected within exon 8, leading to a substitution from arginine to tryptophan (AGG > TGG: R377W), affecting a splice junction and protein function. The case herein reported further confirms the heterogeneity of PSEN1 mutations and the need to take into account genetic screening in those cases with atypical presentation.

21824290|t|Protein engineering to stabilize soluble amyloid beta-protein aggregates for structural and functional studies.
21824290|a|The molecular biology underlying protein aggregation and neuronal death in Alzheimer's disease is not yet completely understood, but small soluble nonamyloid aggregates of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) have been shown to play a fundamental neurotoxic role. The composition and biological action of such aggregates, known as oligomers and protofibrils, are therefore areas of intense study. However, research is complicated by the multitude of different interconverting aggregates that Abeta can form in vitro and in vivo, and by the inhomogeneity and instability of in vitro preparations. Here we review recent studies in which protein engineering, and in particular disulfide engineering, has been applied to stabilize different Abeta aggregates. For example, several techniques now exist to obtain stable and neurotoxic protofibrillar forms of Abeta, and engineered Abeta dimers, or larger aggregates formed by these, have been shown to specifically induce neuronal damage in a way that mimics Alzheimer's disease pathology. Disulfide engineering has also revealed structural properties of neurotoxic aggregates, for instance that Abeta in protofibrils and globular oligomers adopts a beta-hairpin conformation that is similar to, but topologically distinct from, the conformation of Abeta in mature amyloid fibrils. Protein engineering is therefore a workable strategy to address many of the outstanding questions relating to the structure, interconversion and biological effects of oligomers and protofibrils of Abeta.

21825135|t|ADP ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) controls amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing by mediating the endosomal sorting of BACE1.
21825135|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides, the primary constituents of senile plaques and a hallmark in Alzheimer's disease pathology, are generated through the sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and gamma-secretase. The early endosome is thought to represent a major compartment for APP processing; however, the mechanisms of how BACE1 encounters APP are largely unknown. In contrast to APP internalization, which is clathrin-dependent, we demonstrate that BACE1 is sorted to early endosomes via a route controlled by the small GTPase ADP ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6). Altering ARF6 levels or its activity affects endosomal sorting of BACE1, and consequently results in altered APP processing and Abeta production. Furthermore, sorting of newly internalized BACE1 from ARF6-positive towards RAB GTPase 5 (RAB5)-positive early endosomes depends on its carboxyterminal short acidic cluster-dileucine motif. This ARF6-mediated sorting of BACE1 is confined to the somatodendritic compartment of polarized neurons in agreement with Abeta peptides being primarily secreted from here. These results demonstrate a spatial separation between APP and BACE1 during surface-to-endosome transport, suggesting subcellular trafficking as a regulatory mechanism for this proteolytic processing step. It thereby provides a novel avenue to interfere with Abeta production through a selective modulation of the distinct endosomal transport routes used by BACE1 or APP.

21826062|t|MRK003, a gamma-secretase inhibitor exhibits promising in vitro pre-clinical activity in multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
21826062|a|Notch-stimulated signaling cascade results in transcriptional regulation of genes involved in cell fate decision, apoptosis and proliferation and has been implicated in various malignancies. Here, we investigated the impact of MRK003, an inhibitor of this pathway, on myeloma and lymphoma cells. We first studied the expression patterns of notch receptors and ligands on multiple myeloma (MM) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) cell lines. Next, we used a gamma-secretase inhibitor, MRK003 to test the importance of notch-stimulated pathways in MM and NHL disease biology. We observed expression of notch receptors and ligands on MM and NHL cell lines. MRK003 treatment induced caspase-dependent apoptosis and inhibited proliferation of MM and NHL cell lines and patient cells. Examination of signaling events after treatment showed time-dependent decrease in levels of the notch intracellular domain, Hes1 and c-Myc. MRK003 downregulated cyclin D1, Bcl-Xl and Xiap levels in NHL cells and p21, Bcl-2 and Bcl-Xl in MM cells. In addition, MRK003 caused an upregulation of pAkt, indicating crosstalk with the PI3K/Akt pathway. We evaluated MRK003 in combination with Akt1/2 kinase inhibitor and observed synergy in killing MM and NHL cell lines examined.

21827691|t|ELISA measurement of specific non-antigen-bound antibodies to Abeta1-42 monomer and soluble oligomers in sera from Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitively impaired, and noncognitively impaired subjects.
21827691|a|BACKGROUND: The literature contains conflicting results regarding the status of serum anti-Abeta antibody concentrations in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Reduced levels of these antibodies have been suggested to contribute to the development of this disorder. The conflicting results may be due to polyvalent antibodies, antibody "masking" due to Abeta binding, methodological differences, and/or small sample sizes. The objectives of this pilot study were to compare serum anti-Abeta antibody concentrations between AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and elderly noncognitively impaired (NCI) subjects while addressing these issues, and to perform power analyses to determine appropriate group sizes for future studies employing this approach. METHODS: Serum antibodies to Abeta1-42 monomer and soluble oligomers in AD, MCI, and NCI subjects (10/group) were measured by ELISA, subtracting polyvalent antibody binding and dissociating antibody-antigen complexes. Differences in mean antibody levels were assessed for significance with repeated measures ANOVA using restricted maximum likelihood estimation, using Tukey-Kramer tests and confidence intervals for multiple comparisons. Spearman's rank correlation was used to determine associations between anti-monomer and anti-oligomer antibody concentrations. Estimated sample sizes required to detect effects of various sizes were calculated. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between groups for mean anti-Abeta antibody levels, although these tended to be higher in AD than NCI specimens. Estimated group sizes of 328 and 150 for anti-Abeta monomer and oligomer antibodies, respectively, would have been required for 80% power for significance at 0.05 for a 25% increase in the AD mean relative to the NCI mean. Serum antibody concentrations to Abeta monomer and oligomers were strongly associated (correlations: 0.798 for undissociated sera, 0.564 for dissociated sera). Antibody-antigen dissociation significantly increased anti-Abeta monomer but not anti-Abeta oligomer antibody levels. CONCLUSIONS: The findings in this pilot study are consistent with relatively similar concentrations of specific, non-antigen-bound antibodies to Abeta1-42 monomer and soluble oligomers in AD, MCI, and NCI sera. The differences between groups for these antibodies would have required approximate group sizes of 328 and 150, respectively, for a high probability for statistical significance. These findings do not support the hypothesis that reduced levels of anti-Abeta antibodies might contribute to AD's pathogenesis.

21832049|t|Interactions of pathological hallmark proteins: tubulin polymerization promoting protein/p25, beta-amyloid, and alpha-synuclein.
21832049|a|The disordered tubulin polymerization promoting protein (TPPP/p25) was found to be co-enriched in neuronal and glial inclusions with alpha-synuclein in Parkinson disease and multiple system atrophy, respectively; however, co-occurrence of alpha-synuclein with beta-amyloid (Abeta) in human brain inclusions has been recently reported, suggesting the existence of mixed type pathologies that could result in obstacles in the correct diagnosis and treatment. Here we identified TPPP/p25 as an interacting partner of the soluble Abeta oligomers as major risk factors for Alzheimer disease using ProtoArray human protein microarray. The interactions of oligomeric Abeta with proteins involved in the etiology of neurological disorders were characterized by ELISA, surface plasmon resonance, pelleting experiments, and tubulin polymerization assay. We showed that the Abeta(42) tightly bound to TPPP/p25 (K(d) = 85 nm) and caused aberrant protein aggregation by inhibiting the physiologically relevant TPPP/p25-derived microtubule assembly. The pair-wise interactions of Abeta(42), alpha-synuclein, and tubulin were found to be relatively weak; however, these three components formed soluble ternary complex exclusively in the absence of TPPP/p25. The aggregation-facilitating activity of TPPP/p25 and its interaction with Abeta was monitored by electron microscopy with purified proteins by pelleting experiments with cell-free extracts as well as by confocal microscopy with CHO cells expressing TPPP/p25 or amyloid. The finding that the interaction of TPPP/p25 with Abeta can produce pathological-like aggregates is tightly coupled with unusual pathology of the Alzheimer disease revealed previously; that is, partial co-localization of Abeta and TPPP/p25 in the case of diffuse Lewy body disease with Alzheimer disease.

21832091|t|Polymorphic triple beta-sheet structures contribute to amide hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange protection in the Alzheimer amyloid beta42 peptide.
21832091|a|Characterization of the polymorphic structural range of Abeta oligomers is important to the understanding of the mechanisms of toxicity. Yet for highly polymorphic ensembles, experimental structural elucidation is difficult. Here, we use a combination of NMR solvent protection experiments and computational structural screening to identify major species in the amyloid conformational ensemble. We examined the polymorphic pentamer and fibril seeds of Abeta42 and its mutants and compared the theoretical backbone amide protection obtained from simulations with experimental hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange protection ratio. We observed that highly flexible pentamers do not share structural similarities with fibril seed oligomers, except the turn regions. We found that a novel amyloid structural motif of a triple beta-sheet, with the N-terminal residues interacting with the core (Lys(17)-Glu(22)) beta-sheet region, correlates with H/D exchange protection. The triple beta-sheet Abeta42 oligomer has a minimal exposure of hydrophobic residues and is further stabilized by the E22Q (Dutch) mutation in Alzheimer disease. The experimental H/D exchange solvent protection ratio implies that triple beta-sheet fibrils and globulomers could coexist in the Abeta42 ensemble, pointing to a broad heterogeneous aggregate population. Our results suggest that an approach that combines computational modeling with NMR protection data can be a useful strategy for obtaining clues to the preferred conformational species of the assemblies in solution and help in alleviating experimental difficulties and consequently possible errors in the exchange data for Abeta42 fibrils.

21835916|t|A high content drug screen identifies ursolic acid as an inhibitor of amyloid beta protein interactions with its receptor CD36.
21835916|a|A pathological hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD) is deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) in the brain. Abeta binds to microglia via a receptor complex that includes CD36 leading to production of proinflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic reactive oxygen species and subsequent neurodegeneration. Interruption of Abeta binding to CD36 is a potential therapeutic strategy for AD. To identify pharmacologic inhibitors of Abeta binding to CD36, we developed a 384-well plate assay for binding of fluorescently labeled Abeta to Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing human CD36 (CHO-CD36) and screened an Food and Drug Administration-approved compound library. The assay was optimized based on the cells' tolerance to dimethyl sulfoxide, Abeta concentration, time required for Abeta binding, reproducibility, and signal-to-background ratio. Using this assay, we identified four compounds as potential inhibitors of Abeta binding to CD36. These compounds were ursolic acid, ellipticine, zoxazolamine, and homomoschatoline. Of these compounds, only ursolic acid, a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpenoid, successfully inhibited binding of Abeta to CHO-CD36 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The ursolic acid effect reached a plateau at ~20 mum, with a maximal inhibition of 64%. Ursolic acid also blocked binding of Abeta to microglial cells and subsequent ROS production. Our data indicate that cell-based high-content screening of small molecule libraries for their ability to block binding of Abeta to its receptors is a useful tool to identify novel inhibitors of receptors involved in AD pathogenesis. Our data also suggest that ursolic acid is a potential therapeutic agent for AD via its ability to block Abeta-CD36 interactions.

21839746|t|Ultrasonication-dependent acceleration of amyloid fibril formation.
21839746|a|Amyloid fibrils, similar to crystals, form through nucleation and growth. Because of the high free-energy barrier of nucleation, the spontaneous formation of amyloid fibrils occurs only after a long lag phase. Ultrasonication is useful for inducing amyloid nucleation and thus for forming fibrils, while the use of a microplate reader with thioflavin T fluorescence is suitable for detecting fibrils in many samples simultaneously. Combining the use of ultrasonication and microplate reader, we propose an efficient approach to studying the potential of proteins to form amyloid fibrils. With beta(2)-microglobulin, an amyloidogenic protein responsible for dialysis-related amyloidosis, fibrils formed within a few minutes at pH 2.5. Even under neutral pH conditions, fibrils formed after a lag time of 1.5 h. The results propose that fibril formation is a physical reaction that is largely limited by the high free-energy barrier, which can be effectively reduced by ultrasonication. This approach will be useful for developing a high-throughput assay of the amyloidogenicity of proteins.

21840299|t|CXCL8 protects human neurons from amyloid-beta-induced neurotoxicity: relevance to Alzheimer's disease.
21840299|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition in senile plaques colocalized with activated microglia and astrocytes. Recent studies suggest that CXCL8 is involved in the AD pathogenesis. The objective of this study was to determine the cellular sources of CXCL8 in the central nervous system during AD pathogenesis, and investigate the effects of CXCL8 on neuronal survival and/or functions. Our results showed significantly higher CXCL8 levels in AD brain tissue lysates as compared to those of age-matched controls. Upon Abeta and/or pro-inflammatory cytokine stimulation, microglia, astrocytes and neurons were all capable of CXCL8 production in vitro. Although CXCL8-alone did not alter neuronal survival, it did inhibit Abeta-induced neuronal apoptosis and increased neuronal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) production. We conclude that microglia, astrocytes and neurons, all contribute to the enhanced CXCL8 levels in the CNS upon Abeta and/or pro-inflammatory cytokine stimulation. Further, CXCL8 protects neurons possibly by paracrine or autocrine loop and regulates neuronal functions, therefore, may play a protective role in the AD pathogenesis.

21841774|t|Presenilin 1 regulates homeostatic synaptic scaling through Akt signaling.
21841774|a|Neurons adapt to long-lasting changes in network activity, both in vivo and in vitro, by adjusting their synaptic strengths to stabilize firing rates. We found that homeostatic scaling of excitatory synapses was impaired in hippocampal neurons derived from mice lacking presenilin 1 (Psen1(-/-) mice) or expressing a familial Alzheimer's disease-linked Psen1 mutation (Psen1(M146V)). These findings suggest that deficits in synaptic homeostasis may contribute to brain dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.

21843603|t|Epigenetic mechanisms of amyloid-beta production in anisomycin-treated SH-SY5Y cells.
21843603|a|Oxidative stress and inflammation as the pathological components of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been well understood. Among a diversity of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family members, JNK and p38 MAPK subfamilies are relevant to the response of environmental stress, inflammatory stimuli, or other insults. Recent studies have demonstrated that epigenetic mechanisms may play a pivotal role in AD pathogenesis and development. In the present study, we have investigated epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation involved in the activation of stress-related signaling pathways for amyloid-beta (Abeta) production. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were treated by anisomycin, an activator of stress-related MAPKs (JNK and p38 MAPK). A significant increase of intracellular Abeta level in anisomycin-treated SH-SY5Y cells was observed. The expression of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP), beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), and presenilin 1 (PS1) was upregulated by demethylation in three gene promoters associated with the reduction of methyltransferases (DNMTs). Meanwhile, an enhanced level of global histone H3 acetylation accompanied with upregulation of histone acetyltransferases p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP) and downregulation of histone deacetylases (HDACs) was also observed. These findings indicated that the activation of stress-related signaling pathways could result in the increased transcription of APP, BACE1, and PS1 genes through DNMT-dependent hypomethylation and histone H3 hyperacetylation, thus leading to Abeta overproduction. Moreover, our findings provided a novel insight into epigenetic mechanisms by which oxidative stress contributes to the pathogenesis of AD.

21844361|t|S-Nitrosylation activates Cdk5 and contributes to synaptic spine loss induced by beta-amyloid peptide.
21844361|a|The activity of Cdk5 and its regulatory subunit p35 is thought to be important in both normal brain function and neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis. Increased Cdk5 activity, via proteolytic cleavage of p35 to a p25 fragment by the calcium-activated protease calpain or by phosphorylation at Cdk5(Tyr15), can contribute to neurotoxicity. Nonetheless, our knowledge of regulation of Cdk5 activity in disease states is still emerging. Here we demonstrate that Cdk5 is activated by S-nitrosylation or reaction of nitric oxide (NO)-related species with the thiol groups of cysteine residues 83 and 157, to form SNO-Cdk5. We then show that S-nitrosylation of Cdk5 contributes to amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide-induced dendritic spine loss. Furthermore, we observed significant levels of SNO-Cdk5 in postmortem Alzheimer's disease (AD) but not in normal human brains. These findings suggest that S-nitrosylation of Cdk5 is an aberrant regulatory mechanism of enzyme activity that may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD.

21846101|t|Three dimensional models of Cu(2+)-Abeta(1-16) complexes from computational approaches.
21846101|a|Elucidation of the coordination of metal ions to Abeta is essential to understand their role in its aggregation and to rationally design new chelators with potential therapeutic applications in Alzheimer disease. Because of that, in the last 10 years several studies have focused their attention in determining the coordination properties of Cu(2+) interacting with Abeta. However, more important than characterizing the first coordination sphere of the metal is the determination of the whole Cu(2+)-Abeta structure. In this study, we combine homology modeling (HM) techniques with quantum mechanics based approaches (QM) to determine plausible three-dimensional models for Cu(2+)-Abeta(1-16) with three histidines in their coordination sphere. We considered both epsilon and delta coordination of histidines 6, 13, and 14 as well as the coordination of different possible candidates containing oxygen as fourth ligand (Asp1, Glu3, Asp7, Glu11, and CO(Ala2)). Among the 32 models that enclose COO(-), the lowest energy structures correspond to [O(E3),N(delta)(H6),N(epsilon)(H13),N(epsilon)(H14)] (1), [O(E3),N(delta)(H6),N(delta)(H13),N(delta)(H14)] (2), and [O(D7),N(epsilon)(H6),N(delta)(H13),N(delta)(H14)] (3). The most stable model containing CO(Ala2) as fourth ligand in the Cu(2+) coordination sphere is [O(c)(A2),N(epsilon)(H6),N(delta)(H13),N(epsilon)(H14)] (4). An estimation of the relative stability between Glu3 (1) and CO(Ala2) (4) coordinated complexes seems to indicate that the preference for the latter coordination may be due to solvent effects. The present results also show the relationship between the peptidic and metallic moieties in defining the overall geometry of the complex and illustrate that the final stability of the complexes results from a balance between the metal coordination site and amyloid folding upon complexation.

21848289|t|Designed hairpin peptides interfere with amyloidogenesis pathways: fibril formation and cytotoxicity inhibition, interception of the preamyloid state.
21848289|a|Hairpin peptides bearing cross-strand Trp-Trp and Tyr-Tyr pairs at non-H-bonded strand sites modulate the aggregation of two unrelated amyloidogenic systems, human pancreatic amylin (hAM) and alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn), associated with type II diabetes and Parkinson's disease, respectively. In the case of hAM, we have previously reported that inhibition of amyloidogenesis is observed as an increase in the lag time to amyloid formation and a diminished thioflavin (ThT) fluorescence response. In this study, a reduced level of hAM fibril formation is confirmed by transmission electron microscopy imaging. Several of the hairpins tested were significantly more effective inhibitors than rat amylin. Moreover, a marked inhibitory effect on hAM-associated cytotoxicity by the more potent hairpin peptide is demonstrated. In the case of alpha-syn, the dominant effect of active hairpins was, besides a weakened ThT fluorescence response, the earlier appearance of insoluble aggregates that do not display amyloid characteristics with the few fibrils observed having abnormal morphology. We attribute the alteration of the alpha-synuclein aggregation pathway observed to the capture of a preamyloid state and diversion to nonamyloidogenic aggregates. These beta-hairpins represent a new class of amyloid inhibitors that bear no sequence similarity to the amyloid-producing polypeptides that are inhibited. A mechanistic rationale for these effects is proposed.

21848507|t|The Nicastrin ectodomain adopts a highly thermostable structure.
21848507|a|Nicastrin is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, which is part of the high molecular weight gamma-secretase complex. gamma-Secretase is one of the key players associated with the generation of Alzheimer's disease pathology, since it liberates the neurotoxic amyloid beta-peptide. Four proteins Nicastrin, anterior pharynx-defective-1 (Aph-1), presenilin enhancer-2 (Pen-2) and Presenilin are essential to form the active gamma-secretase complex. Recently it has been shown, that Nicastrin has a key function in stabilizing the mature gamma-secretase complex and may also be involved in substrate recognition. So far no structural data for the Nicastrin ectodomain or any other gamma-secretase component are available. We therefore used Circular Dichroism (CD) spectroscopy to demonstrate that Nicastrin, similar to its homologues, the Streptomyces griseus aminopeptidase (SGAP) and the transferrin receptor (TfR), adopts a thermostable secondary structure. Furthermore, the Nicastrin ectodomain has an exceptionally high propensity to refold after thermal denaturation. These findings provide evidence to further support the hypothesis that Nicastrin may share evolutionary conserved properties with the aminopeptidase and the transferrin receptor family.

21849536|t|APP is phosphorylated by TrkA and regulates NGF/TrkA signaling.
21849536|a|The pathogenic model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) posits that aggregates of amyloid beta, a product of amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, cause dementia. However, alterations of normal APP functions could contribute to AD pathogenesis, and it is therefore important to understand the role of APP. APP is a member of a gene family that shows functional redundancy as documented by the evidence that single knock-out mice are viable, whereas mice with combined deletions of APP family genes die shortly after birth. A residue in the APP intracellular region, Y(682), is indispensable for these essential functions of APP. It is therefore important to identify pathways that regulate phosphorylation of Y(682) as well as the role of Y(682) in vivo. TrkA is associated with both phosphorylation of APP-Y(682) and alteration of APP processing, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of APP links APP processing and neurotrophic signaling to intracellular pathways associated with cellular differentiation and survival. Here we have tested whether the NGF/TrkA signaling pathway is a physiological regulator of APP phosphorylation. We find that NGF induces tyrosine phosphorylation of APP, and that APP interacts with TrkA and this interaction requires Y(682). Unpredictably, we also uncover that APP, and specifically Y(682), regulates activation of the NGF/TrkA signaling pathway in vivo, the subcellular distribution of TrkA and the sensitivity of neurons to the trophic action of NGF. This evidence suggests that these two membrane protein's functions are strictly interconnected and that the NGF/TrkA signaling pathway is involved in AD pathogenesis and can be used as a therapeutic target.

21852138|t|Prolyl isomerase Pin1 as a molecular switch to determine the fate of phosphoproteins.
21852138|a|Pin1 is a highly conserved enzyme that only isomerizes specific phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro bonds in certain proteins, thereby inducing conformational changes. Such conformational changes represent a novel and tightly controlled signaling mechanism regulating a spectrum of protein activities in physiology and disease; often through phosphorylation-dependent, ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. In this review, we summarize recent advances in elucidating the role and regulation of Pin1 in controlling protein stability. We also propose a mechanism by which Pin1 functions as a molecular switch to control the fates of phosphoproteins. We finally stress the need to develop tools to visualize directly Pin1-catalyzed protein conformational changes as a way to determine their roles in the development and treatment of human diseases.

21855175|t|3xTgAD mice exhibit altered behavior and elevated Abeta after chronic mild social stress.
21855175|a|Chronic stress may be a risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), but most studies of the effects of stress in models of AD utilize acute adverse stressors of questionable clinical relevance. The goal of this work was to determine how chronic psychosocial stress affects behavioral and pathological outcomes in an animal model of AD, and to elucidate underlying mechanisms. A triple-transgenic mouse model of AD (3xTgAD mice) and nontransgenic control mice were used to test for an affect of chronic mild social stress on blood glucose, plasma glucocorticoids, plasma insulin, anxiety, and hippocampal amyloid beta-particle (Abeta), phosphorylated tau (ptau), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. Despite the fact that both control and 3xTgAD mice experienced rises in corticosterone during episodes of mild social stress, at the end of the 6-week stress period 3xTgAD mice displayed increased anxiety, elevated levels of Abeta oligomers and intraneuronal Abeta, and decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels, whereas control mice did not. Findings suggest 3xTgAD mice are more vulnerable than control mice to chronic psychosocial stress, and that such chronic stress exacerbates Abeta accumulation and impairs neurotrophic signaling.

21855336|t|Synthesis and evaluation of ferrocenoyl pentapeptide (Fc-KLVFF) as an inhibitor of Alzheimer's Abeta1-42 fibril formation in vitro.
21855336|a|Aggregation and fibril formation of beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta) is the key event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Many efforts have been made on the development of effective inhibitors to prevent Abeta fibril formation or disassemble the preformed Abeta fibrils. Peptide inhibitors with sequences homologous to the hydrophobic segments of Abeta can alter the aggregation pathway of Abeta, together with decrease of the cell toxicity. In this study, the conjugate of ferrocenoyl (Fc) with pentapeptide KLVFF (Fc-KLVFF), was synthesized by HBTU/HOBt protocol in solution. The inhibitory effect of Fc-KLVFF on Abeta(1-42) fibril formation was evaluated by thioflavin T fluorescence assay, and confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses. Fc-KLVFF shows high inhibitory effect towards the fibril formation of Abeta(1-42). Additionally, the attachment of ferrocenoyl moiety onto peptides allows us to investigate the interaction between the inhibitor and Abeta(1-42) in real-time by electrochemical method. As expected, tethering of ferrocenoyl moiety onto pentapeptide shows improved lipophilicity and significant resistance towards proteolytic degradation compared to its parent peptide.

21855637|t|Isotope-assisted vibrational circular dichroism investigations of amyloid beta peptide fragment, Abeta(16-22).
21855637|a|Isotope-assisted vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) investigations have been used to probe the site specific local structure of an amyloid peptide for the first time. A seven residue peptide, NH(2)-KLVFFAE-COOH, which represents the Abeta(16-22) fragment of the Alzheimer's amyloid beta peptide, was used for these investigations. (13)C labels were introduced separately at the carbonyl group of leucine (residue 17), alanine (residue 21) and also at both sites together. Since VCD spectra provide structure dependent signs, band shapes and frequencies, the isotope-assisted VCD spectroscopy revealed information on site specific secondary structure of the polypeptide. Isotope dilution VCD experiments provided a means to distinguish between parallel and anti-parallel nature of the beta-sheet structure formed by the Abeta(16-22) fragment. The current results establish the usefulness of isotope-assisted VCD analysis in determining the site specific secondary structure of amyloid peptides.

21856333|t|Inhibition of PKA attenuates memory deficits induced by beta-amyloid (1-42), and decreases oxidative stress and NF-kappaB transcription factors.
21856333|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most relevant cause of dementia in elderly, is characterized by amyloid beta (Abeta) containing plaques and neurofibrillatory tangles, synaptic and neuronal loss, along with progressive cognitive impairment in short-term memory. However, mechanistic links between protein kinase A (PKA), oxidative stress and memory loss in response to Abeta remain elusive. In the present study, we examined the effects of post-training bilateral intra-hippocampal infusions of the specific protein kinase AII inhibitor, H-89, on memory deficits induced by Abeta (1-42) in Abeta-pretreated rats. H-89 and Abeta were administered immediately after completion of training. All animals were trained for 4 consecutive days and tested 9 and 19 days after the infusions. Significant differences were observed in the time and distance of finding the hidden platform in Abeta treated animals after 19 days. Interestingly, intra-hippocampal infusion of H-89 (5muM/side) significantly prevented the Abeta-induced memory impairment. Furthermore, evaluation of NFkappaB (nuclear factor-kappaB), and antioxidant enzymes, such as gamma-GCS (glutamylcysteine synthetase), HO-1 (hemeoxygenase-1), GSH (glutathione), and SOD (superoxide dismutase) confirmed the protective effect of H-89. Given the possible neuroprotective effects of H-89 on Abeta-induced memory impairment, our results may open a new avenue for the prevention of AD by PKAII signaling pathway inhibitor.

21858698|t|Effect of phenolic compounds against Abeta aggregation and Abeta-induced toxicity in transgenic C. elegans.
21858698|a|Substantial evidence suggests that the aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide into fibrillar structures that is rich in beta-sheets is implicated as the cause of Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, an attractive therapeutic strategy is to prevent or alter Abeta aggregation. Phenolic compounds are natural substances that are composed of one or more aromatic phenolic rings and present in wine, tea, fruits, vegetables and a wide variety of plants. In this work, we investigated the effects of ferulic acid, morin, quercetin and gossypol against Abeta aggregation. From the ThT and turbidity assays, it is observed that in addition to the fibril aggregate, another type of aggregate is formed in the presence of morin, quercetin, and gossypol. On the other hand, ferulic acid did not prevent fibril formation, but it did appear to reduce the average length of fibrils compared to Abeta alone. To study the protective effects of phenolic compounds on Abeta-induced toxicity, we utilized the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) as an in vivo model organism, human Abeta is expressed intracellularly in the body wall muscle. We found that exposure of Caenorhabditis elegans to ferulic acid give more protection against Abeta toxicity than morin, quercetin and gossypol.

21860087|t|Cerebrospinal fluid matrix metalloproteinases and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases in combination with subcortical and cortical biomarkers in vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
21860087|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) are intertwined by mixed dementia (MD) harboring varying degrees of AD pathology in combination with cerebrovascular disease. The aim was to assess whether there is a difference in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile, of selected proteins, between patients with VaD and MD with subcortical vascular disease (SVD), AD, and healthy controls that could contribute in the separation of the groups. The study included 30 controls, 26 SVD patients (9 VaD and 17 MD) and 30 AD patients. The protein panel included total tau (T-tau), hyperphosphorylated tau 181 (P-tau(181)), amyloid beta 1-42 (Abeta(1-42)), neurofilament light (NF-L), myelin basic protein (MBP), heart fatty acid binding protein (H-FABP), matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, -2, -3, -9, and -10), and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1 and -2). Immunochemical methods were utilized for quantification of the proteins in CSF and data analysis was performed with a multivariate discriminant algorithm. The concentrations of MBP, TIMP-1, P-tau(181), NF-L, T-tau, MMP-9, Abeta(1-42), and MMP-2 contributed the most to the separation between SVD and AD, with a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 90% (AUC = 0.92). MBP and NF-L performed the best in discriminating SVD from controls, while T-tau and Abeta(1-42) contributed the most in segregating AD from controls. The CSF biomarkers reflecting AD pathology (T-tau, P-tau(181), and Abeta(1-42)), white matter lesions (NF-L and MBP) and matrix remodeling (MMP-9 and TIMP-1) perform well in differentiating between SVD and AD patients.

21860091|t|Therapeutic potential and anti-amyloidosis mechanisms of tert-butylhydroquinone for Alzheimer's disease.
21860091|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major cause of dementia in the elderly with no effective treatment. Accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) in the brain, one of the pathological features of AD, is considered to be a central disease-causing and disease-promoting event in AD. In this study, we showed that feeding male AbetaPP/PS1 transgenic mice, a well established mouse model of AD, with a diet containing phenolic antioxidant tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) dramatically reduced brain Abeta load with no significant effect on the amounts of alpha- and beta-C-terminal fragments or full-length AbetaPP. Further studies showed that TBHQ diet inhibited the expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), a protease inhibitor which plays a critical role in brain Abeta accumulation in AD, accompanied by increases in the activities of tissue type and urokinase type plasminogen activators (tPA and uPA) as well as plasmin. Moreover, we showed that TBHQ diet increased the expression of low density lipoprotein related protein-1, a multi ligand endocytotic receptor involved in transporting Abeta out of the brain, and plasma Abeta(40) and Abeta(42) levels. We also showed that TBHQ diet increased the concentration of glutathione, an important antioxidant, and suppressed the expression of NADPH oxidase 2 as well as lipid peroxidation. Collectively, our data suggest that TBHQ may have therapeutic potential for AD by increasing brain antioxidant capacity/reducing oxidative stress level and by stimulating Abeta degradation/clearance pathways.

21863870|t|Interaction of thioflavin T with amyloid fibrils: stoichiometry and affinity of dye binding, absorption spectra of bound dye.
21863870|a|The fluorescence of the benzothiazole dye thioflavin T (ThT) is a well-known test for amyloid fibril formation. It has now become evident that ThT can also be used for structural investigations of amyloid fibrils and even for the treatment of amyloid diseases. In this case, one of the most urgent problems is an accurate determination of ThT-amyloid fibril binding parameters: the number of binding modes, stoichiometry, and binding constant for each mode. To obtain information concerning the ThT-amyloid fibril binding parameters, we propose to use absorption spectrophotometry of solutions prepared by equilibrium microdialysis. This approach is inherently designed for the determination of dye-receptor binding parameters. However, it has been very rarely used in the study of dye-protein interactions and has never been used to study the binding parameters of ThT or its analogues to amyloid fibrils. We showed that, when done in corpore, this approach enables the determination of not only binding parameters but also the absorption spectrum and molar extinction coefficient of ThT bound to sites of different binding modes. The proposed approach was used for the examination of lysozyme amyloid fibrils. Two binding modes were found for the ThT-lysozyme amyloid fibril interaction. These binding modes have significantly different binding constants (K(b1) = 7.5 x 10(6) M(-1), K(b2) = 5.6 x 10(4) M(-1)) and a different number of dye binding sites on the amyloid fibrils per protein molecule (n(1) = 0.11, n(2) = 0.24). The absorption spectra of ThT bound to sites of different modes differ from each other (epsilon(b1,max) = 5.1 x 10(4) M(-1) cm(-1), epsilon(b2,max) = 6.7 x 10(4) M(-1)cm(-1), lambda(max) = 449 nm) and significantly differ from that of free ThT in aqueous solution (epsilon(max) = 3.2 x 10(4) M(-1)cm(-1), lambda(max) = 412 nm).

21865887|t|Accumulation of transactive response DNA binding protein 43 in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease.
21865887|a|Transactive response DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) plays a central role in the neuropathology of frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but the relationship between TDP-43 abnormalities and Alzheimer disease (AD) remains unclear. To determine whether TDP-43 can serve as a neuropathologic marker of AD, we performed biochemical characterization and quantification of TDP-43 in homogenates from parietal neocortex of subjects with aclinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment (NCI, n = 12), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 12), or AD (n = 12). Immunoblots revealed increased detergent-insoluble TDP-43 in the cortex of 0, 3, and 6 of the 12 individuals with NCI, MCI, or AD, respectively. Detergent-insoluble TDP-43 was positively correlated with the accumulation of soluble Abeta42, amyloid plaques, and paired helical filamenttau. In contrast, phospho-TDP-43 was decreased in the cytosolic fraction and detergent-soluble membrane/nuclear fraction from AD patients and correlated with antemortem cognitive function.Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed that the frequencies of individuals with TDP-43 or phospho-TDP-43 cytoplasmic inclusions were higher in AD than in NCI, with MCI at an intermediate level. These data indicate that abnormalities of TDP-43 occur in an important subset of MCI and AD patients and that they correlate with the clinical and neuropathologic features of AD.

21866101|t|Small molecule inhibitors reveal Niemann-Pick C1 is essential for Ebola virus infection.
21866101|a|Ebola virus (EboV) is a highly pathogenic enveloped virus that causes outbreaks of zoonotic infection in Africa. The clinical symptoms are manifestations of the massive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to infection and in many outbreaks, mortality exceeds 75%. The unpredictable onset, ease of transmission, rapid progression of disease, high mortality and lack of effective vaccine or therapy have created a high level of public concern about EboV. Here we report the identification of a novel benzylpiperazine adamantane diamide-derived compound that inhibits EboV infection. Using mutant cell lines and informative derivatives of the lead compound, we show that the target of the inhibitor is the endosomal membrane protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1). We find that NPC1 is essential for infection, that it binds to the virus glycoprotein (GP), and that antiviral compounds interfere with GP binding to NPC1. Combined with the results of previous studies of GP structure and function, our findings support a model of EboV infection in which cleavage of the GP1 subunit by endosomal cathepsin proteases removes heavily glycosylated domains to expose the amino-terminal domain, which is a ligand for NPC1 and regulates membrane fusion by the GP2 subunit. Thus, NPC1 is essential for EboV entry and a target for antiviral therapy.

21868184|t|Development of a novel radioimmunoassay to detect autoantibodies to amyloid beta peptides in the presence of a cross-reactive therapeutic antibody.
21868184|a|An increasing need in the development of biotherapeutic agents is the ability to monitor a potential autoimmune response to the therapeutic target of interest. Unfortunately, the presence of high concentrations of therapeutic antibody can hinder such detection, because there is competition for binding in cases where epitopes are not structurally distinct. This situation was encountered in the development of LY2062430, a therapeutic mid-domain monoclonal anti-amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) antibody undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. This communication reports the development and validation of a novel radioimmunoassay used to measure potential patient immune responses to Abeta in the presence of LY2062430. This assay employs a radioiodinated analog of the human amyloid beta 1-40 peptide (Abeta1-40) in which a single amino acid substitution of alanine for phenylalanine at position 19 (F19A) effectively eliminates binding by LY2062430. In contrast, F19A binding by monoclonal antibodies specific for the N- and C-termini of the human Abeta1-40 peptide was shown to be unaltered. Additional experiments involving a polyclonal rabbit antibody raised against the midregion of Abeta1-40 (residues 15-30) resulted in only a slight reduction in binding to the F19A tracer, suggesting that the modification does not affect distal epitopes in Abeta1-40 and supporting the notion that this conservative substitution produces only subtle change in the overall peptide structure. The assay is therefore believed to detect most, if not all, patient antibodies to native Abeta peptides. The assay was validated for use in clinical trials allowing detection of antibodies to Abeta in human serum in the presence of therapeutic concentrations of LY2062430.

21868378|t|Lysine 624 of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a critical determinant of amyloid beta peptide length: support for a sequential model of gamma-secretase intramembrane proteolysis and regulation by the amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) juxtamembrane region.
21868378|a|gamma-Secretase is a multiprotein intramembrane cleaving aspartyl protease (I-CLiP) that catalyzes the final cleavage of the amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) to release the amyloid beta peptide (Abeta). Abeta is the primary component of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and its mechanism of production has been studied intensely. gamma-Secretase executes multiple cleavages within the transmembrane domain of APP, with cleavages producing Abeta and the APP intracellular domain (AICD), referred to as gamma and epsilon, respectively. The heterogeneous nature of the gamma cleavage that produces various Abeta peptides is highly relevant to AD, as increased production of Abeta 1-42 is genetically and biochemically linked to the development of AD. We have identified an amino acid in the juxtamembrane region of APP, lysine 624, on the basis of APP695 numbering (position 28 relative to Abeta) that plays a critical role in determining the final length of Abeta peptides released by gamma-secretase. Mutation of this lysine to alanine (K28A) shifts the primary site of gamma-secretase cleavage from 1-40 to 1-33 without significant changes to epsilon cleavage. These results further support a model where epsilon cleavage occurs first, followed by sequential proteolysis of the remaining transmembrane fragment, but extend these observations by demonstrating that charged residues at the luminal boundary of the APP transmembrane domain limit processivity of gamma-secretase.

21868380|t|Substrate sequence influences gamma-secretase modulator activity, role of the transmembrane domain of the amyloid precursor protein.
21868380|a|A subset of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs modulates the gamma cleavage site in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to selectively reduce production of Abeta42. It is unclear precisely how these gamma-secretase modulators (GSMs) act to preferentially spare Abeta40 production as well as Notch processing and signaling. In an effort to determine the substrate requirements in NSAID/GSM activity, we determined the effects of sulindac sulfide and flurbiprofen on gamma-cleavage of artificial constructs containing several gamma-secretase substrates. Using FLAG-tagged constructs that expressed extracellularly truncated APP, Notch-1, or CD44, we found that these substrates have different sensitivities to sulindac sulfide. gamma-Secretase cleavage of APP was altered by sulindac sulfide, but CD44 and Notch-1 were either insensitive or only minimally altered by this compound. Using chimeric APP constructs, we observed that the transmembrane domain (TMD) of APP played a pivotal role in determining drug sensitivity. Substituting the APP TMD with that of APLP2 retained the sensitivity to gamma-cleavage modulation, but replacing TMDs from Notch-1 or ErbB4 rendered the resultant molecules insensitive to drug treatment. Specifically, the GXXXG motif within APP appeared to be critical to GSM activity. Consequently, the modulatory effects on gamma-cleavage appears to be substrate-dependent. We hypothesize that the substrate present in the gamma-secretase complex influences the conformation of the complex so that the binding site of GSMs is either stabilized or less favorable to influence the cleavage of the respective substrates.

21871956|t|Aging and amyloid beta-induced oxidative DNA damage and mitochondrial dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease: implications for early intervention and therapeutics.
21871956|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting thousands of people in the world and effective treatment is still not available. Over two decades of intense research using AD postmortem brains, transgenic mouse and cell models of amyloid precursor protein and tau revealed that amyloid beta (Abeta) and hyperphosphorylated tau are synergistically involved in triggering disease progression. Accumulating evidence also revealed that aging and amyloid beta-induced oxidative DNA damage and mitochondrial dysfunction initiate and contributes to the development and progression of the disease. The purpose of this article is to summarize the latest progress in aging and AD, with a special emphasis on the mitochondria, oxidative DNA damage including methods of its measurement. It also discusses the therapeutic approaches against oxidative DNA damage and treatment strategies in AD.

21872592|t|Astrocytes contain amyloid-beta annular protofibrils in Alzheimer's disease brains.
21872592|a|Annular protofibrils (APFs) represent a newly described and distinct class of amyloid structures formed by disease-associated proteins. In vitro, these pore-like structures have been implicated in membrane permeabilization and ion homeostasis via pore formation. Still, their formation and relevance in vivo are poorly understood. Herein, we report that APFs are in human Alzheimer's disease brain samples and that amyloid-beta APFs were associated with activated astrocytes. Moreover, we show that amyloid-beta APFs in astrocytes adopt a conformation in which the N-terminal region is buried inside the wall of the pore. Our results together with previous studies suggest that the formation of amyloid-beta APFs in astrocytes could be a relevant event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and validate this amyloidogenic structure as a target for the prevention of the disease.

21873225|t|Serotonin signaling is associated with lower amyloid-beta levels and plaques in transgenic mice and humans.
21873225|a|Aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) as toxic oligomers and amyloid plaques within the brain appears to be the pathogenic event that initiates Alzheimer's disease (AD) lesions. One therapeutic strategy has been to reduce Abeta levels to limit its accumulation. Activation of certain neurotransmitter receptors can regulate Abeta metabolism. We assessed the ability of serotonin signaling to alter brain Abeta levels and plaques in a mouse model of AD and in humans. In mice, brain interstitial fluid (ISF) Abeta levels were decreased by 25% following administration of several selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant drugs. Similarly, direct infusion of serotonin into the hippocampus reduced ISF Abeta levels. Serotonin-dependent reductions in Abeta were reversed if mice were pretreated with inhibitors of the extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) signaling cascade. Chronic treatment with an SSRI, citalopram, caused a 50% reduction in brain plaque load in mice. To test whether serotonin signaling could impact Abeta plaques in humans, we retrospectively compared brain amyloid load in cognitively normal elderly participants who were exposed to antidepressant drugs within the past 5 y to participants who were not. Antidepressant-treated participants had significantly less amyloid load as quantified by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with Pittsburgh Compound B (PIB). Cumulative time of antidepressant use within the 5-y period preceding the scan correlated with less plaque load. These data suggest that serotonin signaling was associated with less Abeta accumulation in cognitively normal individuals.

21873424|t|BRI2 protein regulates beta-amyloid degradation by increasing levels of secreted insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE).
21873424|a|The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is one of the major proteins involved in Alzheimer disease (AD). Proteolytic cleavage of APP gives rise to amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides that aggregate and deposit extensively in the brain of AD patients. Although the increase in levels of aberrantly folded Abeta peptide is considered to be important to disease pathogenesis, the regulation of APP processing and Abeta metabolism is not fully understood. Recently, the British precursor protein (BRI2, ITM2B) has been implicated in influencing APP processing in cells and Abeta deposition in vivo. Here, we show that the wild type BRI2 protein reduces plaque load in an AD mouse model, similar to its disease-associated mutant form, ADan precursor protein (ADanPP), and analyze in more detail the mechanism of how BRI2 and ADanPP influence APP processing and Abeta metabolism. We find that overexpression of either BRI2 or ADanPP reduces extracellular Abeta by increasing levels of secreted insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), a major Abeta-degrading protease. This effect is also observed with BRI2 lacking its C-terminal 23-amino acid peptide sequence. Our results suggest that BRI2 might act as a receptor protein that regulates IDE levels that in turn influences APP metabolism in a previously unrecognized way. Targeting the regulation of IDE may be a promising therapeutic approach to sporadic AD.

21873994|t|Ligand binding to distinct states diverts aggregation of an amyloid-forming protein.
21873994|a|Although small molecules that modulate amyloid formation in vitro have been identified, significant challenges remain in determining precisely how these species act. Here we describe the identification of rifamycin SV as a potent inhibitor of beta(2) microglobulin (beta(2)m) fibrillogenesis when added during the lag time of assembly or early during fibril elongation. Biochemical experiments demonstrate that the small molecule does not act by a colloidal mechanism. Exploiting the ability of electrospray ionization-ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (ESI-IMS-MS) to resolve intermediates of amyloid assembly, we show instead that rifamycin SV inhibits beta(2)m fibrillation by binding distinct monomeric conformers, disfavoring oligomer formation and diverting the course of assembly to the formation of spherical aggregates. The results demonstrate the power of ESI-IMS-MS to identify specific protein conformers as targets for intervention in fibrillogenesis using small molecules and reveal a mechanism of action in which ligand binding diverts unfolded protein monomers toward alternative assembly pathways.

21876253|t|Episodic memory decline predicts cortical amyloid status in community-dwelling older adults.
21876253|a|Intra-individual decline in memory and cognition is characteristic of prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may allow detection of very early AD pathology. Episodic memory task scores on a brief computerized cognitive battery (CogState) were prospectively evaluated at baseline, and 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-, and 24-months post-baseline. Linear mixed models were conducted to compute age-adjusted slopes. Subjects with slopes declining >=90th percentile ("memory decliners") and age- and gender-matched subjects without such decline ("non-decliners") were studied with clinical, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging evaluations. Of 195 who completed 24-month evaluation (age 51 to 80 years), 15 memory decliners (mean age 62.7 years, SD 7.6) were identified, and matched with 33 non-decliners (mean age 63.3 years, SD 8.2). Amyloid-PET imaging was qualitatively abnormal with excess cortical amyloid accumulation in 7 memory decliners (46.7%) and 4 (12.1%) non-decliners (odds ratio 6.34), and quantitatively abnormal with standardized uptake value ratios >1.4 in 5 memory decliners (33.3%) and 2 (6.1%) non-decliners (odds ratio 8.3). One of the memory decliners and none of the non-decliners fulfilled criteria for mild cognitive impairment, but the groups did not differ with respect to subjective memory impairment, neuropsychological evidence of episodic memory impairment, or MRI imaging abnormalities. Intra-individual decline in episodic memory can be detected using a brief computerized cognitive performance test optimized to detect change in community-dwelling non-demented older persons and appears predictive of the presence of cerebral amyloid in about half of these persons. This approach may help detect early prodromal AD pathology in wider-scale community screening programs.

21880397|t|Amyloid neuropathology in the single Arctic APP transgenic model affects interconnected brain regions.
21880397|a|The Arctic APP mutation (E693G) within the amyloid beta (Abeta) domain of amyloid precursor protein (APP) leads to dementia with clinical features similar to Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is believed to be mediated via increased formation of protofibrils. We have generated a transgenic mouse model, TgAPParc, with neuron-specific expression of human amyloid precursor protein with the Arctic mutation (hAPParc), showing mild amyloid pathology with a relatively late onset. Here we performed a detailed analysis of the spatiotemporal progression of neuropathology in homozygous TgAPParc, focusing on intracellular Abeta and diffuse Abeta aggregates rather than amyloid plaques. We show that the neuropathology in homozygous TgAPParc mice starts with intracellular Abeta aggregates, which is followed by diffuse extracellular Abeta deposits in subiculum that later expands to brain regions receiving neuronal projections from regions already affected. Together this suggests that the pathology in TgAPParc mice affects interconnected brain regions and may represent a valuable tool to study the spread and progression of neuropathology in Alzheimer's disease.

21881209|t|Cerebral amyloid-beta proteostasis is regulated by the membrane transport protein ABCC1 in mice.
21881209|a|In Alzheimer disease (AD), the intracerebral accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides is a critical yet poorly understood process. Abeta clearance via the blood-brain barrier is reduced by approximately 30% in AD patients, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. ABC transporters have been implicated in the regulation of Abeta levels in the brain. Using a mouse model of AD in which the animals were further genetically modified to lack specific ABC transporters, here we have shown that the transporter ABCC1 has an important role in cerebral Abeta clearance and accumulation. Deficiency of ABCC1 substantially increased cerebral Abeta levels without altering the expression of most enzymes that would favor the production of Abeta from the Abeta precursor protein. In contrast, activation of ABCC1 using thiethylperazine (a drug approved by the FDA to relieve nausea and vomiting) markedly reduced Abeta load in a mouse model of AD expressing ABCC1 but not in such mice lacking ABCC1. Thus, by altering the temporal aggregation profile of Abeta, pharmacological activation of ABC transporters could impede the neurodegenerative cascade that culminates in the dementia of AD.

21882806|t|A new structural model of Abeta40 fibrils.
21882806|a|The amyloid fibrils of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides play important roles in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Comprehensive solid-state NMR (SSNMR) structural studies on uniformly isotope-labeled Abeta assemblies have been hampered for a long time by sample heterogeneity and low spectral resolution. In this work, SSNMR studies on well-ordered fibril samples of Abeta(40) with an additional N-terminal methionine provide high-resolution spectra which lead to an accurate structural model. The fibrils studied here carry distinct structural features compared to previous reports. The inter-beta-strand contacts within the U-shaped beta-strand-turn-beta-strand motif are shifted, the N-terminal region adopts a beta-conformation, and new inter-monomer contacts occur at the protofilament interface. The revealed structural diversity in Abeta fibrils points to a complex picture of Abeta fibrillation.

21883219|t|Reduced levels of the tyrosine phosphatase STEP block beta amyloid-mediated GluA1/GluA2 receptor internalization.
21883219|a|Striatal-Enriched protein tyrosine Phosphatase of MW 61 kDa (STEP(61)) is a protein tyrosine phosphatase recently implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). STEP(61) is elevated in human AD prefrontal cortex and in the cortex of several AD mouse models. The elevated levels of active STEP(61) down-regulate surface expression of GluN1/GluN2B (formerly NR1/NR2B) receptor complexes, while genetically reducing STEP levels rescues both the biochemical and cognitive deficits in a triple transgenic AD mouse model (3xTg-AD). Here, we show that increased STEP(61) also plays a role in beta amyloid (Abeta)-mediated internalization of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-(AMPA) receptor (AMPAR) subunits GluA1/GluA2 (formerly GluR1/GluR2). We purified Abeta oligomers and determined that oligomers, but not monomers, lead to endocytosis of GluA1/GluA2 receptors in cortical cultures. The decrease in GluA1/GluA2 receptors is reversed in the progeny of STEP knock-out (KO) mice crossed with Tg2576 mice, despite elevated levels of Abeta. These results provide strong support for the hypothesis that STEP(61) is required for Abeta-mediated internalization of GluA1/GluA2 receptors.

21883223|t|Activation of alpha-secretase cleavage.
21883223|a|Alpha-secretase-mediated cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) releases the neuroprotective APP fragment salphaAPP and prevents amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) generation. Moreover, alpha-secretase-like cleavage of the Abeta transporter 'receptor for advanced glycation end products' counteracts the import of blood Abeta into the brain. Assuming that Abeta is responsible for the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), activation of alpha-secretase should be preventive. alpha-Secretase-mediated APP cleavage can be activated via several G protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases. Protein kinase C, mitogen-activated protein kinases, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, cAMP and calcium are activators of receptor-induced alpha-secretase cleavage. Selective targeting of receptor subtypes expressed in brain regions affected by AD appears reasonable. Therefore, the PACAP receptor PAC1 and possibly the serotonin 5-HT(6) receptor subtype are promising targets. Activation of APP alpha-secretase cleavage also occurs upon blockade of cholesterol synthesis by statins or zaragozic acid A. Under physiological statin concentrations, the brain cholesterol content is not influenced. Statins likely inhibit Abeta production in the blood by alpha-secretase activation which is possibly sufficient to inhibit AD development. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) acts as alpha-secretase on APP. By targeting the nuclear retinoic acid receptor beta, the expression of ADAM10 and non-amyloidogenic APP processing can be enhanced. Excessive activation of ADAM10 should be avoided because ADAM10 and also ADAM17 are not APP-specific. Both ADAM proteins cleave various substrates, and therefore have been associated with tumorigenesis and tumor progression.

21884802|t|Not quite PIB-positive, not quite PIB-negative: slight PIB elevations in elderly normal control subjects are biologically relevant.
21884802|a|Researchers employing Pittsburgh Compound B positron emission tomography (PIB-PET) imaging have consistently indentified old normal control (oNC) subjects with elevated tracer uptake, suggesting the presence of beta-amyloid deposition in these individuals. However, a consensus regarding the level at which PIB reveals a biologically meaningful signal does not exist (ie. an appropriate cutoff value for PIB positivity remains unclear). In this exploratory study, we sought to investigate the range of PIB distribution volume ratio (DVR) values present in our oNC cohort (N=75, age range=58-97). oNC subjects were classified based on global PIB index values (average DVR across prefrontal, parietal, lateral temporal and cingulate cortices) by employing two approaches: (1) an iterative outlier approach that revealed a cutoff value of 1.16 (IO-cutoff) and (2) an approach using data from a sample of young normal control subjects (N=11, age range=20-30) that yielded a cutoff value of 1.08 (yNC-cutoff). oNC subjects falling above the IO-cutoff had values similar to AD subjects ("PIB+", 15%). Subjects falling between the 2 cutoffs were considered to have ambiguous PIB status ("Ambig", 20%) and the remaining oNC were considered "PIB-" (65%). Additional measures capturing focal DVR magnitude and extent of elevated DVR values were consistent with the classification scheme using PIB index values, and revealed evidence for elevated DVR values in a subset of PIB- oNC subjects. Furthermore, there were a greater proportion of ambiguously elevated values compared to low values, and these elevated values were present in regions known to show amyloid deposition. The analyses presented in this study, in conjunction with recently published pathological data, suggest a biological relevance of slight PIB elevations in aging.

21885280|t|Synthesis and evaluation of 1-(4-[18F]fluoroethyl)-7-(4'-methyl)curcumin with improved brain permeability for beta-amyloid plaque imaging.
21885280|a|Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain. We previously developed [(18)F]fluoropropylcurcumin ([(18)F]FP-curcumin), which demonstrated excellent binding affinity (K(i)=0.07 nM) for Abeta(1-40) aggregates and good pharmacokinetics in normal mouse brains. However, its initial brain uptake was poor (0.52% ID/g at 2 min post-injection). Therefore, in the present study, fluorine-substituted 4,4'-bissubstituted or pegylated curcumin derivatives were synthesized and evaluated. Their binding affinities for Abeta(1-42) aggregates were measured and 1-(4-fluoroethyl)-7-(4'-methyl)curcumin (1) had the highest binding affinity (K(i)=2.12 nM). Fluorescence staining of Tg APP/PS-1 mouse brain sections demonstrated high and specific labeling of Abeta plaques by 1 in the cortex region, which was confirmed with thioflavin-S staining of the same spots in the adjacent brain sections. Radioligand [(18)F]1 was found to have an appropriate partition coefficient (logP(o/w)=2.40), and its tissue distribution in normal mice demonstrated improved brain permeability (1.44% ID/g at 2 min post-injection) compared to that of [(18)F]FP-curcumin by a factor of 2.8 and fast wash-out from mouse brains (0.45% ID/g at 30 min post-injection). These results suggest that [(18)F]1 may hold promise as a PET radioligand for Abeta plaque imaging.

21889115|t|Impact of apolipoprotein E4-cerebrospinal fluid beta-amyloid interaction on hippocampal volume loss over 1 year in mild cognitive impairment.
21889115|a|BACKGROUND: The majority of studies relating amyloid pathology with brain volumes have been cross-sectional. Apolipoprotein e4 (APOE e4), a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, is also known to be associated with hippocampal volume loss. No studies have considered the effects of amyloid pathology and APOE e4 together on longitudinal volume loss. METHODS: We evaluated whether an abnormal level of cerebrospinal fluid beta-amyloid (CSF Abeta) and APOE e4 carrier status were independently associated with greater hippocampal volume loss over 1 year. We then assessed whether APOE e4 status and CSF Abeta acted synergistically, testing the significance of an interaction term in the regression analysis. We included 297 participants: 77 cognitively normal, 144 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 76 with Alzheimer's disease. RESULTS: An abnormal CSF Abeta level was found to be associated with greater hippocampal volume loss over 1 year in each group. APOE e4 was associated with hippocampal volume loss only in the cognitively normal and MCI groups. APOE e4 carriers with abnormal CSF Abeta in the MCI group acted synergistically to produce disproportionately greater volume loss than noncarriers. CONCLUSION: Baseline CSF Abeta predicts progression of hippocampal volume loss. APOE e4 carrier status amplifies the degree of neurodegeneration in MCI. Understanding the effect of interactions between genetic risk and amyloid pathology will be important in clinical trials and our understanding of the disease process.

21889458|t|Effect of zinc binding on beta-amyloid structure and dynamics: implications for Abeta aggregation.
21889458|a|Assembly of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide into toxic oligomers is widely believed to initiate Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Under in vitro physiological conditions, zinc (Zn(II)) can bind to Abeta and redirect its assembly from amyloid fibrillar toward less toxic amorphous aggregation. Propensity of Abeta to go toward a specific form of aggregate state is determined by structural and dynamical properties of the initial monomeric as well as the aggregate state. Here we probe the structural and dynamical impact of binding of Zn(II) to monomeric Abeta40 using NMR spectroscopy. To obtain further support for the importance of intrinsic dynamics in the aggregation precursor, (15)N relaxation measurements were also performed for Abeta42, the more fibrillar aggregation-prone variant of Abeta. The combined data suggest that, upon Zn(II)-binding to the N-terminus of Abeta40, a relatively rigid turnlike structure is induced at residues Val(24)-Lys(28) whereas the residues flanking this region become more mobile on the picosecond-to-nanosecond timescale. This is in contrast to the increased rigidity of Abeta42 at the C-terminus, and proposed to be linked to the higher propensity of Zn(II)-bound peptide to form amorphous aggregates with less entropic penalties than their fibrillar counterparts.

21889462|t|Structure and dynamics of oligomeric intermediates in beta2-microglobulin self-assembly.
21889462|a|beta(2)-Microglobulin is a 99-residue protein with a propensity to form amyloid-like fibrils in vitro which exhibit distinct morphologies dependent on the solution conditions employed. Here we have used ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry to characterize the oligomeric species detected during the formation of worm-like fibrils of beta(2)-microglobulin at pH 3.6. Immediately upon sample dissolution, beta(2)-microglobulin monomer and oligomers-the latter ranging in size from dimer to hexamer-are present as a pool of rapidly interconverting species. Increasing the ionic strength of the solution initiates fibril formation without a lag-phase whereupon these oligomers become more stable and higher-order species (7-mer to >14-mer) are observed. The oligomers detected have collision cross-sectional areas consistent with a linearly stacked assembly comprising subunits of native-like volume. The results provide insights into the identity and properties of the transient, oligomeric intermediates formed during assembly of worm-like fibrils and identify species that differ significantly from the oligomers previously characterized during the nucleated assembly of long, straight fibrils. The data presented demonstrate the interrelationship between different fibril-forming pathways and identify their points of divergence.

21891867|t|Homocysteine, vitamin B12, and folic acid levels in Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and healthy elderly: baseline characteristics in subjects of the Australian Imaging Biomarker Lifestyle study.
21891867|a|There is some debate regarding the differing levels of plasma homocysteine, vitamin B12 and serum folate between healthy controls (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). As part of the Australian Imaging Biomarker Lifestyle (AIBL) study of aging cohort, consisting of 1,112 participants (768 HC, 133 MCI patients, and 211 AD patients), plasma homocysteine, vitamin B12, and serum and red cell folate were measured at baseline to investigate their levels, their inter-associations, and their relationships with cognition. The results of this cross-sectional study showed that homocysteine levels were increased in female AD patients compared to female HC subjects (+16%, p-value < 0.001), but not in males. Red cell folate, but not serum folate, was decreased in AD patients compared to HC (-10%, p-value = 0.004). Composite z-scores of short- and long-term episodic memory, total episodic memory, and global cognition all showed significant negative correlations with homocysteine, in all clinical categories. Increasing red cell folate had a U-shaped association with homocysteine, so that high red cell folate levels were associated with worse long-term episodic memory, total episodic memory, and global cognition. These findings underscore the association of plasma homocysteine with cognitive deterioration, although not unique to AD, and identified an unexpected abnormality of red cell folate.

21891870|t|Loss of astrocyte polarization in the tg-ArcSwe mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
21891870|a|Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is the predominant water channel in brain and is selectively expressed in astrocytes. Astrocytic endfoot membranes exhibit tenfold higher densities of AQP4 than non-endfoot membranes, making AQP4 an excellent marker of astrocyte polarization. Loss of astrocyte polarization is known to compromise astrocytic function and to be associated with impaired water and K+ homeostasis. Here we investigate by a combination of light and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry whether amyloid deposition is associated with a loss of astrocyte polarization, using AQP4 as a marker. We used the tg-ArcSwe mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, as this model displays perivascular plaques as well as plaques confined to the neuropil. 3D reconstructions were done to establish the spatial relation between plaques and astrocytic endfeet, the latter known to contain the perivascular pool of AQP4. Changes in AQP4 expression emerge just after the appearance of the first plaques. Typically, there is a loss of AQP4 from endfoot membranes at sites of perivascular amyloid deposits, combined with an upregulation of AQP4 in the neuropil surrounding plaques. By electron microscopy it could be verified that the upregulation reflects an increased concentration of AQP4 in those delicate astrocytic processes that abound in synaptic regions. Thus, astrocytes exhibit a redistribution of AQP4 from endfoot membranes to non-endfoot membrane domains. The present data suggest that the development of amyloid deposits is associated with a loss of astrocyte polarization. The possible perturbation of water and K+ homeostasis could contribute to cognitive decline and seizure propensity in patients with Alzheimer's disease.

21892833|t|Structural basis for inhibiting beta-amyloid oligomerization by a non-coded beta-breaker-substituted endomorphin analogue.
21892833|a|The distribution of endomorphins (EM) 1 and 2 in the human brain inversely correlates with cerebral neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD), implying a protective role. These endogenous opioid peptides incorporate aromatic residues and a beta-breaker motif, as seen in several optimized inhibitors of Abeta aggregation. The activity of native endomorphins was studied, as well as the rationally designed analogue Aib-1, which includes a remarkably efficient beta-breaker, alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib). In vitro and GFP fusion protein assays showed that Aib-1 interacted with Abeta and markedly inhibited the formation of toxic oligomer and fibril growth. Moreover, Aib-1 prevented the toxicity of Abeta toward neuronal PC12 cells and markedly rectified reduced longevity of an AD fly model. Atomistic simulations and NMR-derived solution structures revealed that Aib-1 significantly reduced the propensity of Abeta to aggregate due to multimode interactions including aromatic, hydrophobic, and polar contacts. We suggest that hindering the self-assembly process by interfering with the aromatic core of amyloidogenic peptides may pave the way toward developing therapeutic agents to treat amyloid-associated diseases.

21896486|t|Novel gamma-secretase enzyme modulators directly target presenilin protein.
21896486|a|gamma-Secretase is essential for the generation of the neurotoxic 42-amino acid amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta(42)). The aggregation-prone hydrophobic peptide, which is deposited in Alzheimer disease (AD) patient brain, is generated from a C-terminal fragment of the beta-amyloid precursor protein by an intramembrane cleavage of gamma-secretase. Because Abeta(42) is widely believed to trigger AD pathogenesis, gamma-secretase is a key AD drug target. Unlike inhibitors of the enzyme, gamma-secretase modulators (GSMs) selectively lower Abeta(42) without interfering with the physiological function of gamma-secretase. The molecular target(s) of GSMs and hence the mechanism of GSM action are not established. Here we demonstrate by using a biotinylated photocross-linkable derivative of highly potent novel second generation GSMs that gamma-secretase is a direct target of GSMs. The GSM photoprobe specifically bound to the N-terminal fragment of presenilin, the catalytic subunit of gamma-secretase, but not to other gamma-secretase subunits. Binding was differentially competed by GSMs of diverse structural classes, indicating the existence of overlapping/multiple GSM binding sites or allosteric alteration of the photoprobe binding site. The beta-amyloid precursor protein C-terminal fragment previously implicated as the GSM binding site was not targeted by the compound. The identification of presenilin as the molecular target of GSMs directly establishes allosteric modulation of enzyme activity as a mechanism of GSM action and may contribute to the development of therapeutically active GSMs for the treatment of AD.

21899367|t|Molecular insight into conformational transition of amyloid beta-peptide 42 inhibited by (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate probed by molecular simulations.
21899367|a|Considerable experimental evidence indicates that (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) inhibits the fibrillogenesis of Abeta(42) and alleviates its associated cytotoxicity. However, the molecular mechanism of the inhibition effect of EGCG on the conformational transition of Abeta(42) remains unclear due to the limitations of current experimental techniques. In this work, molecular dynamics simulations and molecular mechanics-Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) analysis were coupled to better understand the issue. It was found that the direct interactions between EGCG and the peptide are the origin of its inhibition effects. Specifically, EGCG molecules expel water from the surface of the Abeta(42), cluster with each other, and interact directly with the peptide. The results of free energy decomposition calculated by MM-PBSA indicate that the nonpolar term contributes more than 71% to the binding free energy of the EGCG-Abeta(42) complex, while polar interactions (i.e., hydrogen bonding) play a minor role. It was identified that there are 12 important residues of Abeta(42) that strongly interact with EGCG (Phe4, Arg5, Phe19, Phe20, Glu22, Lys28, Gly29, Leu34-Gly37, and Ile41), while nonpolar interactions are mainly provided by the side chains of some hydrophobic residues (Phe, Met and Ile) and the main chains of some nonhydrophobic residues (Lys28 and Gly29). On the contrary, polar interactions are mainly formed by the main chain of Abeta(42), of which the main chains of Gly29 and Gly37 contribute greatly. The work has thus elucidated the molecular mechanism of the inhibition effect of EGCG on the conformational transition of Abeta(42), and the findings are considered critical for exploring more effective agents for the inhibition of Abeta(42) fibrillogenesis.

21899735|t|Osteoarthritis accelerates and exacerbates Alzheimer's disease pathology in mice.
21899735|a|BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether localized peripheral inflammation, such as osteoarthritis, contributes to neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative disease in vivo. METHODS: We employed the inducible Col1-IL1betaXAT mouse model of osteoarthritis, in which induction of osteoarthritis in the knees and temporomandibular joints resulted in astrocyte and microglial activation in the brain, accompanied by upregulation of inflammation-related gene expression. The biological significance of the link between peripheral and brain inflammation was explored in the APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) whereby osteoarthritis resulted in neuroinflammation as well as exacerbation and acceleration of AD pathology. RESULTS: Induction of osteoarthritis exacerbated and accelerated the development of neuroinflammation, as assessed by glial cell activation and quantification of inflammation-related mRNAs, as well as Abeta pathology, assessed by the number and size of amyloid plaques, in the APP/PS1; Col1-IL1betaXAT compound transgenic mouse. CONCLUSION: This work supports a model by which peripheral inflammation triggers the development of neuroinflammation and subsequently the induction of AD pathology. Better understanding of the link between peripheral localized inflammation, whether in the form of osteoarthritis, atherosclerosis or other conditions, and brain inflammation, may prove critical to our understanding of the pathophysiology of disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and other neurodegenerative diseases.

21900234|t|Amyloid-beta-induced synapse damage is mediated via cross-linkage of cellular prion proteins.
21900234|a|The cellular prion protein (PrP(C)), which is highly expressed at synapses, was identified as a receptor for the amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers that are associated with dementia in Alzheimer disease. Here, we report that Abeta oligomers secreted by 7PA2 cells caused synapse damage in cultured neurons via a PrP(C)-dependent process. Exogenous PrP(C) added to Prnp knock-out((0/0)) neurons was targeted to synapses and significantly increased Abeta-induced synapse damage. In contrast, the synapse damage induced by a phospholipase A(2)-activating peptide was independent of PrP(C). In Prnp wild-type((+/+)) neurons Abeta oligomers activated synaptic cytoplasmic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)). In these cells, the addition of Abeta oligomers triggered the translocation of cPLA(2) in synapses to cholesterol dense membranes (lipid rafts) where it formed a complex also containing Abeta and PrP(C). In contrast, the addition of Abeta to Prnp((0/0)) neurons did not activate synaptic cPLA(2), which remained in the cytoplasm and was not associated with Abeta. Filtration assays and non-denaturing gels demonstrated that Abeta oligomers cross-link PrP(C). We propose that it is the cross-linkage of PrP(C) by Abeta oligomers that triggers abnormal activation of cPLA(2) and synapse damage. This hypothesis was supported by our observation that monoclonal antibody mediated cross-linkage of PrP(C) also activated synaptic cPLA(2) and caused synapse damage.

21900936|t|Resolving controversies on the path to Alzheimer's therapeutics.
21900936|a|Alzheimer's disease constitutes a personal and societal tragedy of immense proportions. Since 1960, research in laboratories and clinics worldwide has elucidated many features of this insidious and ultimately fatal syndrome, and this progress has led to initial human trials of potentially disease-modifying agents. However, some of these agents have already failed. Gnawing controversies and important gaps in our knowledge seem to cast additional doubt on the ability of the field to move forward effectively. Here I discuss some of these looming concerns and offer possible explanations for the major trial failures that suggest they are not predictive of the future. Rigorous preclinical validation of mechanism-based therapeutic agents followed by meticulously designed trials that focus on the cardinal cognitive symptoms and their associated biomarkers in the mild or presymptomatic phases of Alzheimer's disease are likely to lead to success, perhaps in the not-too-distant future.

21903077|t|Nitration of tyrosine 10 critically enhances amyloid beta aggregation and plaque formation.
21903077|a|Part of the inflammatory response in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the upregulation of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) resulting in increased NO production. NO contributes to cell signaling by inducing posttranslational protein modifications. Under pathological conditions there is a shift from the signal transducing actions to the formation of protein tyrosine nitration by secondary products like peroxynitrite and nitrogen dioxide. We identified amyloid beta (Abeta) as an NO target, which is nitrated at tyrosine 10 (3NTyr(10)-Abeta). Nitration of Abeta accelerated its aggregation and was detected in the core of Abeta plaques of APP/PS1 mice and AD brains. NOS2 deficiency or oral treatment with the NOS2 inhibitor L-NIL strongly decreased 3NTyr(10)-Abeta, overall Abeta deposition and cognitive dysfunction in APP/PS1 mice. Further, injection of 3NTyr(10)-Abeta into the brain of young APP/PS1 mice induced beta-amyloidosis. This suggests a disease modifying role for NOS2 in AD and therefore represents a potential therapeutic target.

21903360|t|Qualification opinion of novel methodologies in the predementia stage of Alzheimer's disease: cerebro-spinal-fluid related biomarkers for drugs affecting amyloid burden--regulatory considerations by European Medicines Agency focusing in improving benefit/risk in regulatory trials.
21903360|a|The European Medicines Agency (EMA) in London is responsible for the Regulatory review of new medicinal products for Marketing Authorisation, through which pharmaceutical companies may obtain first Marketing Authorisation and subsequent Variations valid throughout the EU and EFTA. The qualification opinion of novel methodologies is a new procedure where applicants can obtain scientific advice on new methodologies for regulatory clinical trials of efficacy of new compounds. It will help benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP. The definition of prodromal AD is acceptable. The "Dubois Criteria" as criteria to define the population must be validated in full at the time of the submission of the dossiers. Including a positive CSF biomarker profile is considered predictive for the evaluation of the AD-dementia type. However, although high CSF tau and low CSF Abeta42 are predictive of Alzheimer's disease, the criterion "positive CSF tau/Abeta42 ratio" is not well defined. The qualification of biomarkers in the pre-dementia stage of Alzheimer's disease will allow better inclusion criteria of patients in pre-dementia trials in which the benefit/risk is higher for treatment with these novel compounds.

21903584|t|Neuronal death induced by nanomolar amyloid beta is mediated by primary phagocytosis of neurons by microglia.
21903584|a|Alzheimer disease is characterized by neuronal loss and brain plaques of extracellular amyloid beta (Abeta), but the means by which Abeta may induce neuronal loss is not entirely clear. Although high concentrations of Abeta (muM) can induce direct toxicity to neurons, we find that low concentration (nM) induce neuronal loss through a microglia-mediated mechanism. In mixed neuronal-glial cultures from rat cerebellum, 250 nM Abeta1-42 (added as monomers, oligomers or fibers) induced about 30% loss of neurons between 2 and 3 days. This neuronal loss occurred without any increase in neuronal apoptosis or necrosis, and no neuronal loss occurred with Abeta42-1. Abeta greatly increased the phagocytic capacity of microglia and induced phosphatidylserine exposure (an "eat-me" signal) on neuronal processes. Blocking exposed phosphatidylserine by adding annexin V or an antibody to phosphatidylserine or inhibiting microglial phagocytosis by adding either cytochalasin D (to block actin polymerization) or cyclo(RGDfV) (to block vitronectin receptors) significantly prevented neuronal loss. Loss of neuronal synapses occurred in parallel with loss of cell bodies and was also prevented by blocking phagocytosis. Inhibition of phagocytosis prevented neuronal loss with no increase in neuronal death, even after 7 days, suggesting that microglial phagocytosis was the primary cause of neuronal death induced by nanomolar Abeta.

In this study, a variety of GJP14 derivatives were prepared using pyrrole derivatives, (haloalkyl)oxiranes, and amines, and their anti-prion activity was evaluated in TSE-infected cells. It was found that the tricyclic aromatic ring, a hydroxy group at the 2-position and an amino group at the 3-position of the N-propyl group were the basic requirements for anti-prion activity. The derivatives bearing an N-ortho-halobenzyl group exhibited an improved activity, and the most potent derivative was 8 times as effective as the original lead compound, GJP14.

21908392|t|Subtypes of progressive aphasia: application of the International Consensus Criteria and validation using beta-amyloid imaging.
21908392|a|Primary progressive aphasia comprises a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative conditions with diverse clinical profiles and underlying pathological substrates. A major development has been the publication of the recent International Consensus Criteria for the three major variants namely: semantic, non-fluent/agrammatic and logopenic. The logopenic variant is assumed to represent an atypical presentation of Alzheimer pathology although evidence for this is, at present, limited. The semantic and non-fluent/agrammatic variants are largely associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 and tau pathology, respectively. The applicability of the International Consensus Criteria to an unselected clinical sample is unknown and no agreed clinical evaluation scale on which to derive the diagnosis exists. We assessed 47 consecutive cases of primary progressive aphasic seen over a 3-year period in a specialist centre, using a newly developed progressive aphasia language scale. A subgroup of 30 cases underwent (11)C-labelled Pittsburgh Compound B positron emission tomography imaging, a putative biomarker of Alzheimer's disease that detects beta-amyloid accumulation, and they were compared with an age-matched group (n = 10) with typical, predominately amnestic Alzheimer's disease. The application of an algorithm based on four key speech and language variables (motor speech disorders, agrammatism, single-word comprehension and sentence repetition) classified 45 of 47 (96%) of patients and showed high concordance with the gold standard expert clinical diagnosis based on the International Consensus Criteria. The level of neocortical beta-amyloid burden varied considerably across aphasic variants. Of 13 logopenic patients, 12 (92%) had positive beta-amyloid uptake. In contrast, one of nine (11%) semantic variant and two of eight (25%) non-fluent/agrammatic cases were positive. The distribution of beta-amyloid across cortical regions of interest was identical in cases with the logopenic variant to that of patients with typical Alzheimer's disease although the total load was lower in the aphasic cases. Impairments of sentence repetition and sentence comprehension were positively correlated with neocortical burden of beta-amyloid, whereas impaired single-word comprehension showed a negative correlation. The International Consensus Criteria can be applied to the majority of cases with primary progressive aphasic using a simple speech and language assessment scale based upon four key variables. beta-amyloid imaging confirms the higher rate of Alzheimer pathology in the logopenic variant and, in turn, the low rates in the other two variants. The study offers insight into the biological basis of clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease, which appear topographically independent of beta-amyloid load.

21910144|t|Identification of [PtCl2(phen)] binding modes in amyloid-beta peptide and the mechanism of aggregation inhibition.
21910144|a|Platinum phenanthroline complexes inhibit amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregation and reduce Abeta-caused neurotoxicity [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 2008, 105, 6813-6818]. In this study, we investigated the interactions of Abeta(1-16) with [PtCl(2)(phen)] (phen=1,10-phenanthroline) using HPLC, ESI-MS, and NMR spectroscopy , and characterized the identity of products using tandem mass spectrometry. Results indicated that the phenanthroline ligand could induce noncovalent interactions between Abeta peptide and platinum complexes, leading to rapid Abeta platination. Multiple products were generated in the reaction, in which His6/His14 chelation was preferentially formed. Coordination of Asp7, His13, and Lys16 was also detected in other products. The majority of products were monoplatinated adducts with binding of the {Pt(phen)} scaffold, which impeded intermolecular interactions between Abeta peptides. Moreover, noncovalent interactions were confirmed by the interaction between Abeta peptide and [Pt(phen)(2)]Cl(2). The synergistic roles of the phen ligand and platinum(II) atom in the inhibition of Abeta aggregation are discussed.

21911655|t|Intranasal insulin therapy for Alzheimer disease and amnestic mild cognitive impairment: a pilot clinical trial.
21911655|a|OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of intranasal insulin administration on cognition, function, cerebral glucose metabolism, and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer disease (AD). DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Clinical research unit of a Veterans Affairs medical center. PARTICIPANTS: The intent-to-treat sample consisted of 104 adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (n = 64) or mild to moderate AD (n = 40). Intervention  Participants received placebo (n = 30), 20 IU of insulin (n = 36), or 40 IU of insulin (n = 38) for 4 months, administered with a nasal drug delivery device (Kurve Technology, Bothell, Washington). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary measures consisted of delayed story recall score and the Dementia Severity Rating Scale score, and secondary measures included the Alzheimer Disease's Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) score and the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-activities of daily living (ADCS-ADL) scale. A subset of participants underwent lumbar puncture (n = 23) and positron emission tomography with fludeoxyglucose F 18 (n = 40) before and after treatment. RESULTS: Outcome measures were analyzed using repeated-measures analysis of covariance. Treatment with 20 IU of insulin improved delayed memory (P < .05), and both doses of insulin (20 and 40 IU) preserved caregiver-rated functional ability (P < .01). Both insulin doses also preserved general cognition as assessed by the ADAS-cog score for younger participants and functional abilities as assessed by the ADCS-ADL scale for adults with AD (P < .05). Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers did not change for insulin-treated participants as a group, but, in exploratory analyses, changes in memory and function were associated with changes in the Abeta42 level and in the tau protein-to-Abeta42 ratio in cerebrospinal fluid. Placebo-assigned participants showed decreased fludeoxyglucose F 18 uptake in the parietotemporal, frontal, precuneus, and cuneus regions and insulin-minimized progression. No treatment-related severe adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: These results support longer trials of intranasal insulin therapy for patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and patients with AD. Trial Registration  clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00438568.

21911660|t|Effects of age and amyloid deposition on Abeta dynamics in the human central nervous system.
21911660|a|BACKGROUND: The amyloid hypothesis predicts that increased production or decreased clearance of beta-amyloid (Abeta) leads to amyloidosis, which ultimately culminates in Alzheimer disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether dynamic changes in Abeta levels in the human central nervous system may be altered by aging or by the pathology of AD and thus contribute to the risk of AD. DESIGN: Repeated-measures case-control study. SETTING: Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis, Missouri. PARTICIPANTS: Participants with amyloid deposition, participants without amyloid deposition, and younger normal control participants. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: In this study, hourly cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta concentrations were compared with age, status of amyloid deposition, electroencephalography, and video recording data. RESULTS: Linear increases were observed over time in the Abeta levels in CSF samples obtained from the younger normal control participants and the older participants without amyloid deposition, but not from the older participants with amyloid deposition. Significant circadian patterns were observed in the Abeta levels in CSF samples obtained from the younger control participants; however, circadian amplitudes decreased in both older participants without amyloid deposition and older participants with amyloid deposition. Abeta diurnal concentrations were correlated with the amount of sleep but not with the various activities that the participants participated in while awake. CONCLUSIONS: A reduction in the linear increase in the Abeta levels in CSF samples that is associated with amyloid deposition and a decreased CSF Abeta diurnal pattern associated with increasing age disrupt the normal physiology of Abeta dynamics and may contribute to AD.

21912928|t|Analysis of amyloid precursor protein function in Drosophila                      melanogaster.
21912928|a|Amyloid precursor proteins (APPs) are evolutionary conserved from nematodes to man (Jacobsen and Iverfeldt in Cell Mol Life Sci 66:2299-2318, 2009) suggesting an important physiological function of these proteins. Human APP is a key factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease because its proteolytic processing results in the production of the neurotoxic Abeta-peptide, which accumulates in the amyloid plaques characteristic for this disease (Selkoe in Physiol Rev 81(2):741-766, 2001). However, the processing also leads to the production of several other fragments and the role of these products, as well as the function of the full-length protein is so far not well understood. The functional analysis of APP in vertebrates has been hampered by the fact that two close relatives, APLP1 and APLP2, exist and that knock-out mice for APP only show subtle defects. In contrast, invertebrates like Caenorhabditis                         elegans and Drosophila express only one APP-like protein but whereas a null mutation in the C. elegans APL-1 protein is lethal, flies lacking APPL (Amyloid Precursor Protein-like) are viable but show synaptic defects and behavioral abnormalities. Together with the analyses of flies that express APP proteins ectoptically or xenotopically, these studies show that APP proteins are involved in neuronal differentiation, neuritic outgrowth, and synapse formation. In addition, they play a role in long-term memory formation and maintaining brain integrity in adult flies.

21914807|t|Polar transmembrane-based amino acids in presenilin 1 are involved in endoplasmic reticulum localization, Pen2 protein binding, and gamma-secretase complex stabilization.
21914807|a|gamma-Secretase is composed of the four membrane proteins presenilin, nicastrin, Pen2, and Aph1. These four proteins assemble in a coordinated and regulated manner into a high molecular weight complex. The subunits constitute a total of 19 transmembrane domains (TMD), with many carrying important amino acids involved in catalytic activity, interaction with other subunits, or in ER retention/retrieval of unassembled subunits. We here focus on TMD4 of presenilin 1 (PS1) and show that a number of polar amino acids are critical for gamma-secretase assembly and function. An asparagine, a threonine, and an aspartate form a polar interface important for endoplasmic reticulum retention/retrieval. A single asparagine in TMD4 of PS1 is involved in a protein-protein interaction by binding to another asparagine in Pen2. Intriguingly, a charged aspartate in TMD4 is critical for gamma-secretase activity, most likely by stabilizing the newly formed complex.

21915767|t|Amyloid beta-heme peroxidase promoted protein nitrotyrosination: relevance to widespread protein nitration in Alzheimer's disease.
21915767|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide accumulation has been demonstrated to play a central role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Substantial evidence indicates that protein nitrotyrosination contributes to Abeta-dependent neurotoxicity; however, the molecular mechanism is unknown. Recent research has shown that Abeta complexes with heme to form Abeta-heme, and increases the pseudo-peroxidase activity of heme. We found that Abeta-heme uses H(2)O(2) and NO(2)(-) to cause nitration of enolase and synaptic proteins more effectively than heme. Thus, the increased peroxidase activity of Abeta-heme may be the molecular link between excess Abeta and the widespread protein nitration in AD. Interestingly, the site of enolase nitration that was catalyzed by Abeta-heme is different from that induced by heme. Moreover, the secondary structural perturbations of Abeta-heme-treated and heme-treated enolase are also different. These observations suggest that Abeta-heme targets specific amino acid sequences in enolase. Furthermore, our data show that Abeta-heme peroxidase activity is independent of the aggregation state of Abeta, suggesting an important role of soluble Abeta in addition to Abeta aggregates and oligomers in AD pathogenesis.

21917137|a|BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation is an important contributor to the development of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Thus, there is a keen interest in identifying compounds, especially from herbal sources, that can inhibit neuroinflammation. Amyloid-beta (Abeta) is a major component of the amyloid plaques present in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. Here, we examined whether sinomenine, present in a Chinese medicinal plant, prevents oligomeric Abeta-induced microglial activation and confers protection against neurotoxicity. METHODS: Oligomeric amyloid-beta was prepared from Abeta(1-42). Intracellular reactive oxygen species production was determined using the dye 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescin diacetate. Nitric oxide level was assessed using the Griess reagent. Flow cytometry was used to examine the levels of inflammatory molecules. BV2-conditioned medium was used to treat hippocampal cell line (HT22) and primary hippocampal cells in indirect toxicity experiments. Toxicity was assessed using MTT reduction and TUNEL assays. RESULTS: We found that sinomenine prevents the oligomeric Abeta-induced increase in levels of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide in BV2 microglial cells. In addition, sinomenine reduces levels of Abeta-induced inflammatory molecules. Furthermore, sinomenine protects hippocampal HT22 cells as well as primary hippocampal cells from indirect toxicity mediated by Abeta-treated microglial cells, but has no effect on Abeta-induced direct toxicity to HT22 cells. Finally, we found that conditioned medium from Abeta-treated BV2 cells contains increased levels of nitric oxide and inflammatory molecules, but the levels of these molecules are reduced by sinomenine. CONCLUSIONS: Sinomenine prevents oligomeric Abeta-induced microglial activation, and confers protection against indirect neurotoxicity to hippocampal cells. These results raise the possibility that sinomenine may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of Alzheimer's diseases as well as other diseases that involve neuroinflammation.

21917513|t|Copper-mediated growth of amyloid beta fibrils in the presence of oxidized and negatively charged liposomes.
21917513|a|Amyloid beta protein (Abeta) from Alzheimer's disease formed fibrillar aggregates and their morphology depended on oxidized and negatively charged liposomes. The morphology of fibrillar aggregates was affected by Cu(2+), together with their growth kinetics. This is because Cu(2+) inhibited the nucleation step in the formation of amyloid Abeta fibrillar aggregates by forming Abeta/Cu complex inactive to the growth of fibrillar aggregates. In addition, this is probably because Cu(2+) affected the fibrillar aggregate formed on the surface of liposomes. These findings would give a better understanding of the formation mechanism of amyloid fibrils on biomembranes.

21917766|t|A phase 2 randomized trial of ELND005, scyllo-inositol, in mild to moderate Alzheimer disease.
21917766|a|OBJECTIVE: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging phase 2 study explored safety, efficacy, and biomarker effects of ELND005 (an oral amyloid anti-aggregation agent) in mild to moderate Alzheimer disease (AD). METHODS: A total of 353 patients were randomized to ELND005 (250, 1,000, or 2,000 mg) or placebo twice daily for 78 weeks. Coprimary endpoints were the Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB) and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) scale. The primary analysis compared 250 mg (n =84) to placebo (n =82) after an imbalance of infections and deaths led to early discontinuation of the 2 higher dose groups. RESULTS: The 250 mg dose demonstrated acceptable safety. The primary efficacy analysis at 78 weeks revealed no significant differences between the treatment groups on the NTB or ADCS-ADL. Brain ventricular volume showed a small but significant increase in the overall 250 mg group (p =0.049). At the 250 mg dose, scyllo-inositol concentrations increased in CSF and brain and CSF Abetax-42 was decreased significantly compared to placebo (p =0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Primary clinical efficacy outcomes were not significant. The safety and CSF biomarker results will guide selection of the optimal dose for future studies, which will target earlier stages of AD. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: Due to the small sample sizes, this Class II trial provides insufficient evidence to support or refute a benefit of ELND005.

21917767|t|Addressing the ethical, policy, and social challenges of preclinical Alzheimer disease.
21917767|a|Research suggests that Alzheimer disease (AD) pathophysiology begins prior to the clinical expression of the disease and that biomarker measures may provide direct evidence of this process. As a result, it may be possible to uncouple the diagnosis of AD from the clinical expression of the disease. The shifting boundaries between normal brain aging and disease present 3 challenges: 1) establishing guidelines for researchers and clinicians to safely and effectively communicate the diagnosis of preclinical AD, 2) setting up a process that effectively translates this diagnosis into practice and policy, and 3) adapting laws, regulations, and professional practices to the diagnosis of preclinical AD. The field of genetic testing for AD suggests how to balance a patient's desire to know his or her risk of developing dementia with a clinician's desire to mitigate the potential harms of that information. The development of diagnostic and treatment guidelines for other diseases of aging, such as cardiovascular disease, suggests the need for a National Alzheimer's Education Program to develop policies and procedures to translate preclinical AD into both clinical practice and policy. Revisions are needed to laws, regulations, and professional practices governing driving, financial management and planning, and privacy and confidentiality.

21917794|t|In vivo microdialysis reveals age-dependent decrease of brain interstitial fluid tau levels in P301S human tau transgenic mice.
21917794|a|Although tau is a cytoplasmic protein, it is also found in brain extracellular fluids, e.g., CSF. Recent findings suggest that aggregated tau can be transferred between cells and extracellular tau aggregates might mediate spread of tau pathology. Despite these data, details of whether tau is normally released into the brain interstitial fluid (ISF), its concentration in ISF in relation to CSF, and whether ISF tau is influenced by its aggregation are unknown. To address these issues, we developed a microdialysis technique to analyze monomeric ISF tau levels within the hippocampus of awake, freely moving mice. We detected tau in ISF of wild-type mice, suggesting that tau is released in the absence of neurodegeneration. ISF tau was significantly higher than CSF tau and their concentrations were not significantly correlated. Using P301S human tau transgenic mice (P301S tg mice), we found that ISF tau is fivefold higher than endogenous murine tau, consistent with its elevated levels of expression. However, following the onset of tau aggregation, monomeric ISF tau decreased markedly. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that soluble tau in brain homogenates decreased along with the deposition of insoluble tau. Tau fibrils injected into the hippocampus decreased ISF tau, suggesting that extracellular tau is in equilibrium with extracellular or intracellular tau aggregates. This technique should facilitate further studies of tau secretion, spread of tau pathology, the effects of different disease states on ISF tau, and the efficacy of experimental treatments.

21919498|t|Dissociation between the processivity and total activity of gamma-secretase: implications for the mechanism of Alzheimer's disease-causing presenilin mutations.
21919498|a|The amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta), strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), is produced from the amyloid beta-protein precursor (APP) through consecutive proteolysis by beta- and gamma-secretases. The latter protease contains presenilin as the catalytic component of a membrane-embedded aspartyl protease complex. Missense mutations in presenilin are associated with early-onset familial AD, and these mutations generally both decrease Abeta production and increase the ratio of the aggregation-prone 42-residue form (Abeta42) to the 40-residue form (Abeta40). The connection between these two effects is not understood. Besides Abeta40 and Abeta42, gamma-secretase produces a range of Abeta peptides, the result of initial cutting at the epsilon site to form Abeta48 or Abeta49 and subsequent trimming every three or four residues. Thus, gamma-secretase displays both overall proteolytic activity (epsilon cutting) and processivity (trimming) toward its substrate APP. Here we tested whether a decrease in total activity correlates with decreased processivity using wild-type and AD-mutant presenilin-containing protease complexes. Changes in pH, temperature, and salt concentration that reduced the overall activity of the wild-type enzyme did not consistently result in increased proportions of longer Abeta peptides. Low salt concentrations and acidic pH were notable exceptions that subtly alter the proportion of individual Abeta peptides, suggesting that the charged state of certain residues may influence processivity. Five different AD mutant complexes, representing a broad range of effects on overall activity, Abeta42:Abeta40 ratios, and ages of disease onset, were also tested, revealing again that changes in total activity and processivity can be dissociated. Factors that control initial proteolysis of APP at the epsilon site apparently differ significantly from factors affecting subsequent trimming and the distribution of Abeta peptides.

21922048|t|Issues raised involving the copper hypotheses in the causation of Alzheimer's disease.
21922048|a|I present evidence that the epidemic of Alzheimer's disease is a new phenomenon exploding in the latter part of the 20th century in developed countries. I postulate that a major causative factor in the epidemic is the coincident use of copper plumbing, and the ingestion of inorganic copper leaching from the copper plumbing. I present evidence to support this hypothesis and discuss various objections and criticisms that have been raised about the hypothesis, and my responses to these criticisms. I conclude that the hypothesis is well supported by the evidence and deserves serious consideration, because if it is valid, it indentifies a partially preventable cause of Alzheimer's disease.

21924918|t|Solid-state NMR analysis of interaction sites of curcumin and 42-residue amyloid beta-protein fibrils.
21924918|a|Aggregation of 42-residue amyloid beta-protein (Abeta42) plays a pivotal role in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Curcumin, the yellow pigment in the rhizome of turmeric, attracts considerable attention as a food component potentially preventing the pathogenesis of AD. This is because curcumin not only inhibits the aggregation of Abeta42 but also binds to its aggregates (fibrils), resulting in disaggregation. However, the mechanism of interaction between curcumin and the Abeta42 fibrils remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed the binding mode of curcumin to the Abeta42 fibrils by solid-state NMR using dipolar-assisted rotational resonance (DARR). To improve the quality of 2D spectra, 2D DARR data were processed with the covariance NMR method, which enabled us to detect weak cross peaks between carbons of curcumin and those of the Abeta42 fibrils. The observed (13)C-(13)C cross peaks indicated that curcumin interacts with the 12th and 17-21st residues included in the beta-sheet structure in the Abeta42 fibrils. Interestingly, aromatic carbons adjacent to the methoxy and/or hydroxy groups of curcumin showed clear cross peaks with the Abeta42 fibrils. This suggested that these functional groups of curcumin play an important role in its interaction with the Abeta42 fibrils.

21925292|t|Cysteine Cathepsins in the secretory vesicle produce active peptides: Cathepsin L generates peptide neurotransmitters and cathepsin B produces beta-amyloid of Alzheimer's disease.
21925292|a|Recent new findings indicate significant biological roles of cysteine cathepsin proteases in secretory vesicles for production of biologically active peptides. Notably, cathepsin L in secretory vesicles functions as a key protease for proteolytic processing of proneuropeptides (and prohormones) into active neuropeptides that are released to mediate cell-cell communication in the nervous system for neurotransmission. Moreover, cathepsin B in secretory vesicles has been recently identified as a beta-secretase for production of neurotoxic beta- amyloid (Abeta) peptides that accumulate in Alzheimer's disease (AD), participating as a notable factor in the severe memory loss in AD. These secretory vesicle functions of cathepsins L and B for production of biologically active peptides contrast with the well-known role of cathepsin proteases in lysosomes for the degradation of proteins to result in their inactivation. The unique secretory vesicle proteome indicates proteins of distinct functional categories that provide the intravesicular environment for support of cysteine cathepsin functions. Features of the secretory vesicle protein systems insure optimized intravesicular conditions that support the proteolytic activity of cathepsins. These new findings of recently discovered biological roles of cathepsins L and B indicate their significance in human health and disease. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Proteolysis 50 years after the discovery of lysosome.

21925470|t|High-resolution 3D reconstruction reveals intra-synaptic amyloid fibrils.
21925470|a|beta-Amyloid (Abeta) accumulation and aggregation are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). High-resolution three-dimensional (HR-3D) volumetric imaging allows for better analysis of fluorescence confocal microscopy and 3D visualization of Abeta pathology in brain. Early intraneuronal Abeta pathology was studied in AD transgenic mouse brains by HR-3D volumetric imaging. To better visualize and analyze the development of Abeta pathology, thioflavin S staining and immunofluorescence using antibodies against Abeta, fibrillar Abeta, and structural and synaptic neuronal proteins were performed in the brain tissue of Tg19959, wild-type, and Tg19959-YFP mice at different ages. Images obtained by confocal microscopy were reconstructed into three-dimensional volumetric datasets. Such volumetric imaging of CA1 hippocampus of AD transgenic mice showed intraneuronal onset of Abeta42 accumulation and fibrillization within cell bodies, neurites, and synapses before plaque formation. Notably, early fibrillar Abeta was evident within individual synaptic compartments, where it was associated with abnormal morphology. In dendrites, increasing intraneuronal thioflavin S correlated with decreases in neurofilament marker SMI32. Fibrillar Abeta aggregates could be seen piercing the cell membrane. These data support that Abeta fibrillization begins within AD vulnerable neurons, leading to disruption of cytoarchitecture and degeneration of spines and neurites. Thus, HR-3D volumetric image analysis allows for better visualization of intraneuronal Abeta pathology and provides new insights into plaque formation in AD.

21930949|t|Crystal structure of amyloid precursor-like protein 1 and heparin complex suggests a dual role of heparin in E2 dimerization.
21930949|a|Mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP) are associated with familial Alzheimer's disease. Recent development suggests that homo- and heterodimerization of APP and APP-like proteins (APLPs), which are enhanced by heparan sulfate binding, may play a role in signal transduction and cell adhesion. Despite efforts to model heparin binding based on known apo crystal structures, the mechanism of heparin-induced APP/APLP dimerization has not been established experimentally. Here we report the crystal structure of a complex between heparin and the E2 domain of APLP1, which harbors the conserved high affinity heparin binding site of the full-length molecule. Within the asymmetric E2:heparin complex, the polysaccharide is snugly bound inside a narrow groove between the two helical subdomains of one protein protomer. The nonreducing end of the sugar is positioned near the protein's 2-fold axis, making contacts with basic residues from the second protomer. The inability of the E2 dimer to accommodate two heparin molecules near its symmetry axis explains the observed 21 binding stoichiometry, which is confirmed by isothermal titration calorimetric experiment carried out in solution. We also show that, at high concentrations, heparin can destabilize E2 dimer, probably by forcing into the unoccupied binding site observed in the 21 complex. The binding model suggested by the crystal structure may facilitate the design of heparin mimetics that are capable of modulating APP dimerization in cells.

21931162|t|Understanding the kinetic roles of the inducer heparin and of rod-like protofibrils during amyloid fibril formation by Tau protein.
21931162|a|The aggregation of the natively disordered protein, Tau, to form lesions called neurofibrillary tangles is a characteristic feature of several neurodegenerative tauopathies. The polyanion, heparin, is commonly used as an inducer in studies of Tau aggregation in vitro, but there is surprisingly no comprehensive model describing, quantitatively, all aspects of the heparin-induced aggregation reaction. In this study, rate constants and extents of fibril formation by the four repeat domain of Tau (Tau4RD) have been reproducibly determined over a full range of heparin and protein concentrations. The kinetic role of heparin in the nucleation-dependent fibril formation reaction is shown to be limited to participation in the initial rate-limiting steps; a single heparin molecule binds two Tau4RD molecules, forming an aggregation-competent protein dimer, which then serves as a building block for further fibril growth. Importantly, the minimal kinetic model that is proposed can quantitatively account for the characteristic bell-shaped dependence of the aggregation kinetics on the stoichiometry of protein to heparin. Very importantly, this study also identifies for the first time short and thin, rod-like protofibrils that are populated transiently, early during the time course of fibril formation. The identification of these protofibrils as bona fide off-pathway species has implications for the development of therapies for tauopathies based on driving fibril formation as a means of protecting the cell from smaller, putatively toxic aggregates.

21931985|t|Functions of the APP gene family in the nervous system: insights from mouse models.
21931985|a|The amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as proteolytical cleavage of APP gives rise to the beta-amyloid peptide which is deposited in the brains of Alzheimer patients. During the past years, intense research efforts have been directed at elucidating the physiological function(s) of APP and the question of whether a perturbation of these functions contributes to AD pathogenesis. Indeed, a growing body of evidence has accumulated supporting a role of APP and the two closely related homologues APLP1 and APLP2 in various aspects of nervous system development and function, in particular, for synapse formation and function. This review summarizes recent insights into the in vivo role of the APP gene family from mice lacking individual or combinations of APP family members, with particular emphasis on recently generated knockin mice to examine the in vivo relevance of distinct functional domains.

21939202|t|A study of the alpha-helical intermediate preceding the aggregation of the amino-terminal fragment of the beta amyloid peptide (Abeta(1-28)).
21939202|a|The beta amyloid (Abeta) peptide aggregates to form beta-rich structures that are known to trigger Alzheimer's disease. Experiments suggest that an alpha-helical intermediate precedes the formation of these aggregates. However, a description at the molecular level of the alpha-to-beta transition has not been obtained. Because it has been proposed that the transition might be initiated in the amino-terminal region of Abeta, we studied the aggregation of the 28-residue amino-terminal fragment of Abeta (Abeta(1-28)) using molecular dynamics and a coarse-grained force field. Simulations starting from extended and helical conformations showed that oligomerization is initiated by the formation of intermolecular beta-sheets between the residues in the N-terminal regions. In simulations starting from the alpha-helical conformation, forcing residues 17-21 to remain in the initial (helical) conformation prevents aggregation but allows for the formation of dimers, indicating that oligomerization, initiated along the nonhelical N-terminal regions, cannot progress without the alpha-to-beta transition propagating along the chains.

21939532|t|Amyloid beta protein-induced zinc sequestration leads to synaptic loss via dysregulation of the ProSAP2/Shank3 scaffold.
21939532|a|BACKGROUND: Memory deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) manifest together with the loss of synapses caused by the disruption of the postsynaptic density (PSD), a network of scaffold proteins located in dendritic spines. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Since it was shown that ProSAP2/Shank3 scaffold assembly within the PSD is Zn2+-dependent and that the amyloid beta protein (Abeta) is able to bind Zn2+, we hypothesize that sequestration of Zn2+ ions by Abeta contributes to ProSAP/Shank platform malformation. RESULTS: To test this hypothesis, we designed multiple in vitro and in vivo assays demonstrating ProSAP/Shank dysregulation in rat hippocampal cultures following Abeta oligomer accumulation. These changes were independent from alterations on ProSAP/Shank transcriptional level. However, application of soluble Abeta prevented association of Zn2+ ions with ProSAP2/Shank3 in a cell-based assay and decreased the concentration of Zn2+ clusters within dendrites. Zn2+ supplementation or saturation of Abeta with Zn2+ ions prior to cell treatment was able to counter the effects induced by Abeta on synapse density and ProSAP2/Shank3 levels at the PSD. Interestingly, intracellular Zn2+ levels in APP-PS1 mice and human AD hippocampus are reduced along with a reduction in synapse density and synaptic ProSAP2/Shank3 and Shank1 protein levels. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that sequestration of Zn2+ ions by Abeta significantly contributes to changes in ProSAP2/Shank3 platforms. These changes in turn lead to less consolidated (mature) synapses reflected by a decrease in Shank1 protein levels at the PSD and decreased synapse density in hippocampal neurons.

21945306|t|Neurobiological elements of cognitive dysfunction in down syndrome: exploring the role of APP.
21945306|a|Down syndrome (DS) is the most common cause of cognitive dysfunction in children. Additionally, most adults with DS will eventually show both clinical and neuropathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The hippocampal formation constitutes the primary target for degeneration in both AD and DS. Over the past few years, we have studied the molecular mechanisms behind degeneration of this region and its major inputs in mouse models of DS. Our investigation has suggested that the loss of hippocampal inputs, particularly cholinergic and noradrenergic terminals, leads to de-afferentation of this region in the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS. Interestingly, we were able to link the overexpression of amyloid precursor protein (App) gene to degeneration of cholinergic and noradrenergic neurons in DS mouse models. We examined the underlying mechanisms of degeneration of multiple systems with extensive projections to the hippocampus in DS and its mouse models and the role of App overexpression in neurodegeneration. Understanding mechanisms behind hippocampal dysfunction has helped us to test several therapeutic strategies successfully in mouse models of DS. Here we review these strategies and mechanisms and discuss ways to translate our findings into possible interventions in humans.

21945434|t|Crocetin inhibits beta-amyloid fibrillization and stabilizes beta-amyloid oligomers.
21945434|a|Aggregation of a peptide, beta-amyloid (Abeta), is a hallmark molecular process found in Alzheimer's disease (AD). During Abeta aggregation, oligomeric and fibrillar Abeta are formed, and these molecular self-assembly steps are implicated in generation of toxic effects in AD. Crocetin is a natural carotenoid dicarboxyl acid displaying various pharmaceutical effects and may be co-localized with Abeta mediated by human serum albumin. In the study presented here, we examined the effects of crocetin on Abeta aggregation in three different molecular pathways. Our results demonstrate that crocetin inhibited Abeta fibril formation and destabilized pre-formed Abeta fibrils. Moreover, crocetin caused stabilization of Abeta oligomers and prevented their conversion into Abeta fibrils. Our study reveals potential pathological and pharmaceutical implication of crocetin in AD and suggests possible application of crocetin for currently limited structural studies on unstable Abeta oligomers.

21946562|t|microRNA-34c is a novel target to treat dementias.
21946562|a|MicroRNAs are key regulators of transcriptome plasticity and have been implicated with the pathogenesis of brain diseases. Here, we employed massive parallel sequencing and provide, at an unprecedented depth, the complete and quantitative miRNAome of the mouse hippocampus, the prime target of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using integrative genetics, we identify miR-34c as a negative constraint of memory consolidation and show that miR-34c levels are elevated in the hippocampus of AD patients and corresponding mouse models. In line with this, targeting miR-34 seed rescues learning ability in these mouse models. Our data suggest that miR-34c could be a marker for the onset of cognitive disturbances linked to AD and indicate that targeting miR-34c could be a suitable therapy.

21948247|t|Exercise during pregnancy mitigates Alzheimer-like pathology in mouse offspring.
21948247|a|Physical activity protects brain function in healthy individuals and those with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Evidence for beneficial effects of parental exercise on the health status of their progeny is sparse and limited to nondiseased individuals. Here, we questioned whether maternal running interferes with offspring's AD-like pathology and sought to decipher the underlying mechanisms in TgCRND8 mice. Maternal stimulation was provided by voluntary wheel running vs. standard housing during pregnancy. Following 5 mo of standard housing of transgenic and wild-type offspring, their brains were examined for AD-related pathology and/or plasticity changes. Running during pregnancy reduced beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaque burden (-35%, P=0.017) and amyloidogenic APP processing in transgenic offspring and further improved the neurovascular function by orchestrating different Abeta transporters and increasing angiogenesis (+29%, P=0.022). This effect was accompanied by diminished inflammation, as indicated by reduced microgliosis (-20%, P=0.002) and down-regulation of other proinflammatory mediators, and resulted in less oxidative stress, as nitrotyrosine levels declined (-28%, P=0.029). Moreover, plasticity changes (in terms of up-regulation of reelin, synaptophysin, and ARC) were found not only in transgenic but also in wild-type offspring. We conclude that exercise during pregnancy provides long-lasting protection from neurodegeneration and improves brain plasticity in the otherwise unstimulated progeny.

21949245|t|Molecular basis for amyloid-beta polymorphism.
21949245|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregates are the main constituent of senile plaques, the histological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Abeta molecules form beta-sheet containing structures that assemble into a variety of polymorphic oligomers, protofibers, and fibers that exhibit a range of lifetimes and cellular toxicities. This polymorphic nature of Abeta has frustrated its biophysical characterization, its structural determination, and our understanding of its pathological mechanism. To elucidate Abeta polymorphism in atomic detail, we determined eight new microcrystal structures of fiber-forming segments of Abeta. These structures, all of short, self-complementing pairs of beta-sheets termed steric zippers, reveal a variety of modes of self-association of Abeta. Combining these atomic structures with previous NMR studies allows us to propose several fiber models, offering molecular models for some of the repertoire of polydisperse structures accessible to Abeta. These structures and molecular models contribute fundamental information for understanding Abeta polymorphic nature and pathogenesis.

21952521|t|Bacterial contamination and the transport vial material affect cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of beta-Amyloid and Tau protein as determined by enzyme immunoassay.
21952521|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Determination of marker proteins of neuronal degeneration in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is of increasing importance. However, preanalytical problems may compromise the results. METHODS: We studied the influence of the transport tube material and shaking at room temperature on the CSF concentrations of beta-amyloid and tau protein determined by enzyme immunoassays. RESULTS: The materials of the transport tube moderately influenced the CSF concentrations of beta-amyloid and tau protein. Polyethylene and polypropylene tubes were well suited, but glass, polycarbonate and polystyrene tubes caused a decrease in the CSF beta-amyloid and tau protein concentrations. The strongest impact, however, was caused by bacterial contamination of samples. Contamination with high concentrations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and related species rendered beta-amyloid undetectable and strongly diminished tau protein concentrations. The effects of several Gram-positive bacteria were less pronounced. Addition of 0.1% sodium azide prior to bacterial contamination increased the interval at which CSF could be kept at room temperature without a substantial reduction of the beta-amyloid or tau protein concentration. CONCLUSION: Polyethylene or polypropylene tubes are suitable transport vessels for CSF samples. Bacterial contamination during sampling and portioning must be avoided. Addition of sodium azide may be an option when transport of the sample is delayed.

21952557|t|Copper inducing Abeta42 rather than Abeta40 nanoscale oligomer formation is the key process for Abeta neurotoxicity.
21952557|a|Copper is known to be a critical factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, as it is involved in amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide related toxicity. However, the relationship between neurotoxicity and Abeta peptide in the presence of copper remains unclear. The effect of copper has not been clearly differentiated between Abeta42 and Abeta40, and it is still debated whether copper-mediated neurotoxicity is due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation or other molecular mechanisms. Here, we describe that copper dramatically affects Abeta42 aggregation and enhances Abeta42 cytotoxicity while it shows no significant effects on Abeta40. These phenomena are mainly because that the strong interactions between copper and Abeta42 lead to great conformation changes, and stabilize Abeta42 aggregates at highly toxic nanoscale oligomer stage, whereas copper shows no similar impact on Abeta40. We also propose a possible molecular mechanism that copper enhances Abeta42 cytotoxicity via perturbing membrane structure. Moreover, we test the effect of an analogue of copper, nickel, on Abeta aggregation and cytotoxicity, finding that nickel also enhances cytotoxicity via Abeta42 nanoscale oligomer formation. These results clarify that the copper-induced Abeta42 nanoscale oligomer formation is the key process for Abeta neurotoxicity, and suggest that disrupting the interactions between copper and Abeta42 peptide to inhibit nanoscale oligomerization process, deserves more attention in AD drug development.

21952790|t|Structural aspects and physiological consequences of APP/APLP trans-dimerization.
21952790|a|The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is one of the key proteins in Alzheimer's disease (AD), as it is the precursor of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides accumulating in amyloid plaques. The processing of APP and the pathogenic features of especially Abeta oligomers have been analyzed in detail. Remarkably, there is accumulating evidence from cell biological and structural studies suggesting that APP and its mammalian homologs, the amyloid precursor-like proteins (APLP1 and APLP2), participate under physiological conditions via trans-cellular dimerization in synaptogenesis. This offers the possibility that loss of synapses in AD might be partially explained by dysfunction of APP/APLPs cell adhesion properties. In this review, structural characteristics of APP trans-cellular interaction will be placed critically in context with its putative physiological functions focusing on cell adhesion and synaptogenesis.

21952928|t|The phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase-glycogen synthase kinase 3beta pathway mediates bilobalide-induced reduction in amyloid beta-peptide.
21952928|a|Bilobalide (BB), a sesquiterpenoid extract of Ginkgo biloba leaves, has been demonstrated to have neuroprotective effects. The neuroprotective mechanisms were suggested to be associated with modulation of intracellular signaling cascades such as the phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Since some members of intracellular signalling pathways such as PI3K have been demonstrated to be involved in amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, the present study investigated whether BB has an influence on the beta-secretase-mediated APP cleavage via PI3K-dependent pathway. Using HT22 cells and SAMP8 mice (a senescence-accelerated strain of mice), this study showed that BB treatment reduced generation of two beta-secretase cleavage products of APP, the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) and soluble APPbeta (sAPPbeta), via PI3K-dependent pathway. Additionally, glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) signaling might be involved in BB-induced Abeta reduction as a downstream target of the activated PI3K pathway. BB showed no significant effects on beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1) or gamma-secretase but inhibited the beta-secretase activity of another protease cathepsin B, suggesting that BB-induced Abeta reduction was probably mediated through modulation of cathepsin B rather than BACE-1. Similarly, inhibition of GSK3beta did not affect BACE-1 activity but decreased cathepsin B activity, suggesting that the PI3K-GSK3beta pathway was probably involved in BB-induced Abeta reduction. Increasing evidence suggests that decreasing Abeta production in the brain via modulation of APP metabolism should be beneficial for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). BB may offer such an approach to combat AD.

21954973|t|Alzheimer CSF biomarkers in routine clinical setting.
21954973|a|OBJECTIVES: Our work was aimed to evaluate Alzheimer's disease diagnosis improvement using cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers (CSF) in neurological daily practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this purpose, 150 patients clinically and neurochemically classified as having AD or cognitive impairment with or without other dementia type were included in the study. The following CSF peptides were studied, blindly to the clinical diagnosis: beta-amyloid(1-42) peptide (Abeta(1-42)), Tau (T-tau), threonine-181 hyperphosphorylated tau protein (P-tau(181)), and beta-amyloid(1-40) peptide (Abeta(1-40)). From these measurements, Innotest  Amyloid Tau Index (IATI) was calculated for each patient. RESULTS: This assessment allowed to separate 83 biochemical profiles of AD and 67 non-Alzheimer's disease (non-AD), both AD and non-AD categories match with clinical data amounting to 73% and 90%, respectively. Among mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, CSF biomarkers led to discriminate those who are likely to be AD. We devoted a special section to Abeta(1-40) which is not a routine parameter but can help to confirm a pathological amyloid process as Abeta(1-42)/Abeta(1-40) ratio underlining the real decline of the Abeta(1-42). CONCLUSIONS: The interest of biomarkers and their ability to solve awkward cases were carefully noticed all the more when a discrepancy between clinical and CSF biological data was involved. The final proposed algorithm allowed to identify pathogenic forms of AD according to the prevailing role of hyperphosphorylated tau or amyloid beta peptide.

21957232|t|In vivo olfactory model of APP-induced neurodegeneration reveals a reversible cell-autonomous function.
21957232|a|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) has long been linked to the neurodegeneration of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the associated cell death has been difficult to capture in vivo, and the role of APP in effecting neuron loss is still unclear. Olfactory dysfunction is an early symptom of AD with amyloid pathology in the olfactory epithelium correlating well to the brain pathology of AD patients. As olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) regenerate continuously with immature and mature OSNs coexisting in the same olfactory epithelium, we sought to use this unique system to study APP-induced neurodegeneration. Here we have developed an olfactory-based transgenic mouse model that overexpresses humanized APP containing familial AD mutations (hAPP) in either mature or immature OSNs, and found that despite the absence of extracellular plaques a striking number of apoptotic neurons were detected by 3 weeks of age. Importantly, apoptosis was restricted to the specific population overexpressing hAPP, either mature or immature OSNs, sparing those without hAPP. Interestingly, we observed that this widespread neurodegeneration could be rapidly rescued by reducing hAPP expression levels in immature neurons. Together, these data argue that overexpressing hAPP alone could induce cell-autonomous apoptosis in both mature and immature neurons, challenging the notion that amyloid plaques are necessary for neurodegeneration. Furthermore, we show that hAPP-induced neurodegeneration is reversible, suggesting that AD-related neural loss could potentially be rescued. Thus, we propose that this unique in vivo model will not only help determine the mechanisms underlying AD-related neurodegeneration but also serve as a platform to test possible treatments.

21958963|t|Interaction between NH(2)-tau fragment and Abeta in Alzheimer's disease mitochondria contributes to the synaptic deterioration.
21958963|a|Although amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide can promote tau pathology and its toxicity is concurrently tau-dependent, the underlying mechanisms of the in vivo interplay of these proteins remain unsolved. Structural and functional mitochondrial alterations play an early, precipitating role in synaptic failure of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis and an aggravated mitochondrial impairment has been described in triple APP/PS/tau transgenic mice carrying both plaques and tangles, if compared with mice overexpressing tau or amyloid precursor protein (APP) alone. Here, we show that a neurotoxic aminoterminal (NH(2))-derived tau fragment mapping between 26 and 230 amino acids of the human tau40 isoform (441 amino acids)-but not the physiological full-length protein-preferentially interacts with Abeta peptide(s) in human AD synapses in association with mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocator-1 (ANT-1) and cyclophilin D. The two peptides-Abeta 1-42 and the smaller and more potent NH(2)-26-44 peptide of the longest 20-22 kDa NH(2)-tau fragment-inhibit the ANT-1-dependent adenosine diphosphate-adenosine triphosphate (ADP/ATP) exchange in a noncompetitive and competitive manner, respectively, and together further aggravate the mitochondrial dysfunction by exacerbating the ANT-1 impairment. Taken together, these data establish a common, direct and synergistic toxicity of pathological APP and tau products on synaptic mitochondria and suggest potential, new pathway(s) and target(s) for a combined, more efficient therapeutic intervention of early synaptic dysfunction in AD.

21960299|t|Axonal transport of APP and the spatial regulation of APP cleavage and function in neuronal cells.
21960299|a|Over two decades have passed since the original discovery of amyloid precursor protein (APP). While physiological function(s) of APP still remain a matter of debate, consensus exists that the proteolytic processing of this protein represents a critical event in the life of neurons and that abnormalities in this process are instrumental in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Specific molecular components involved in APP proteolysis have been identified, and their enzymatic activities characterized in great detail. As specific proteolytic fragments of APP are identified and novel physiological effects for these fragments are revealed, more obvious becomes our need to understand the spatial organization of APP proteolysis. Valuable insights on this process have been obtained through the study of non-neuronal cells. However, much less is known about the topology of APP processing in neuronal cells, which are characterized by their remarkably complex cellular architecture and extreme degree of polarization. In this review, we discuss published literature addressing various molecular mechanisms and components involved in the trafficking and subcellular distribution of APP and APP secretases in neurons. These include the relevant machinery involved in their sorting, the identity of membranous organelles in which APP is transported, and the molecular motor-based mechanisms involved in their translocation. We also review experimental evidence specifically addressing the processing of APP at the axonal compartment. Understanding neuron-specific mechanisms of APP processing would help illuminating the physiological roles of APP-derived proteolytic fragments and provide novel insights on AD pathogenesis.

21961527|a|Understanding the aggregation mechanism of amyloid fibrils and characterizing their structures are important steps in the investigation of several neurodegenerative disorders associated with the misfolding of proteins. We report a simulation study of coherent two-dimensional chiral signals of three NMR structures of Abeta protein fibrils associated with Alzheimer's Disease, two models for Abeta(8-40) peptide wild-type (WT) and one for the Iowa (D23N) Abeta(15-40) mutant. Both far-ultraviolet (FUV) signals (lambda = 190-250 nm), which originate from the backbone npi* and pipi* transitions, and near-ultraviolet (NUV) signals (lambda >= 250 nm) associated with aromatic side chains (Phe and Tyr) show distinct cross-peak patterns that can serve as novel signatures for the secondary structure.

21965666|a|Pyroglutamate-modified amyloid-beta (Abeta(pE3)) peptides are gaining considerable attention as potential key participants in the pathology of Alzheimer disease (AD) due to their abundance in AD brain, high aggregation propensity, stability, and cellular toxicity. Transgenic mice that produce high levels of Abeta(pE3-42) show severe neuron loss. Recent in vitro and in vivo experiments have proven that the enzyme glutaminyl cyclase catalyzes the formation of Abeta(pE3). In this minireview, we summarize the current knowledge on Abeta(pE3), discussing its discovery, biochemical properties, molecular events determining formation, prevalence in the brains of AD patients, Alzheimer mouse models, and potential as a target for therapy and as a diagnostic marker.

21968933|t|De novo induction of amyloid-beta deposition in vivo.
21968933|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of senile dementia, is associated to the build-up of misfolded amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the brain. Although compelling evidences indicate that the misfolding and oligomerization of Abeta is the triggering event in AD, the mechanisms responsible for the initiation of Abeta accumulation are unknown. In this study, we show that Abeta deposition can be induced by injection of AD brain extracts into animals, which, without exposure to this material, will never develop these alterations. The accumulation of Abeta deposits increased progressively with the time after inoculation, and the Abeta lesions were observed in brain areas far from the injection site. Our results suggest that some of the typical brain abnormalities associated with AD can be induced by a prion-like mechanism of disease transmission through propagation of protein misfolding. These findings may have broad implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for the initiation of AD, and may contribute to the development of new strategies for disease prevention and intervention.

21969169|t|beta-sitosterol inhibits high cholesterol-induced platelet beta-amyloid release.
21969169|a|Recently, increasing evidence has linked high cholesterol to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), suggesting that cholesterol may be a target for developing new compounds to prevent or treat AD. Plant sterols, a group of sterols enriched in plant oils, nuts, and avocados, have the structure very similar to that of cholesterol, and have been widely used to reduce blood cholesterol. Due to their cholesterol-lowering property, plant sterols such as beta-sitosterol may also influence cholesterol-depending functions including its role in AD development. Using human platelets, a type of peripheral blood cells containing the most circulating amyloid precursor protein (APP), this study investigated the effect of beta-sitosterol on high cholesterol-induced secretion of beta amyloid protein (Abeta). It was found that beta-sitosterol effectively inhibited high cholesterol-driven platelet Abeta release. In addition, beta-sitosterol prevented high cholesterol-induced increase of activities of beta- and gamma-secretase, two APP cleaving enzymes to generate Abeta. Additional experiments showed that high cholesterol up-regulated lipid raft cholesterol. This effect of cholesterol could be suppressed by beta-sitosterol. These findings suggest that beta-sitosterol is able to inhibit high cholesterol-induced Abeta release probably through maintenance of membrane cholesterol homeostasis. Given that dietary plant sterols have the potential of penetrating the blood-brain barrier (BBB), these data suggest that plant sterols such as beta-sitosterol may be useful in AD prevention.

21969380|t|Disordered binding of small molecules to Abeta(12-28).
21969380|a|In recent years, an increasing number of small molecules and short peptides have been identified that interfere with aggregation and/or oligomerization of the Alzheimer beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta). Many of them possess aromatic moieties, suggesting a dominant role for those in interacting with Abeta along various stages of the aggregation process. In this study, we attempt to elucidate whether interactions of such aromatic inhibitors with monomeric Abeta(12-28) point to a common mechanism of action by performing atomistic molecular dynamics simulations at equilibrium. Our results suggest that, independently of the presence of inhibitors, monomeric Abeta(12-28) populates a partially collapsed ensemble that is largely devoid of canonical secondary structure at 300 K and neutral pH. The small molecules have different affinities for Abeta(12-28) that can be partially rationalized by the balance of aromatic and charged moieties constituting the molecules. There are no predominant binding modes, although aggregation inhibitors preferentially interact with the N-terminal portion of the fragment (residues 13-20). Analysis of the free energy landscape of Abeta(12-28) reveals differences highlighted by altered populations of a looplike conformer in the presence of inhibitors. We conclude that intrinsic disorder of Abeta persists at the level of binding small molecules and that inhibitors can significantly alter properties of monomeric Abeta via multiple routes of differing specificity.

21971579|t|Peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells derived from Alzheimer's disease patients show elevated baseline levels of secreted cytokines but resist stimulation with beta-amyloid peptide.
21971579|a|OBJECTIVES: Among several other factors, the neuro-toxic beta-amyloid peptide (betaAP)-induced inflammatory mechanisms have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's dementia (AD). Cytokines have recently emerged as prime candidates underlying this immune reaction. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the inflammatory response of peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells (PBMC) in AD. DESIGN: Cross-sectional (observational) study. SETTING: Behavioral and cognitive neurology clinic of the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: AD patients (n=19), healthy elderly (n=19) and young (n=14) individuals. MEASUREMENTS: Cytokine levels were assessed by enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA) after exposing cells to a broad range of betaAP concentrations (10(-4)-10(-10)M) as a stimulus. AD samples were weighed against leukocytes harvested from non-demented young and elderly subjects. RESULTS: Cytokine production of PBMCs in the youth was characterized by low baseline levels when compared to cells from the older generation. In the aging population, AD cells were distinguished from the healthy elderly sub-group by an even higher basal cytokine secretion. The low resting concentration in young individuals was markedly increased after treatment with betaAP, however cells from the elderly, irrespective of their disease status, showed unchanged cytokine release following betaAP administration. Non-specific activation of PBMCs with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies resulted in elevated interleukin (IL)-1beta concentrations in AD. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate a general over-production of cytokines and resistance to betaAP in the old comparison group, with a more pronounced disruption/boosted pattern in AD. Our findings are in line with the hypothesis of "inflammaging", i.e. an enhanced inflammatory profile with normal aging and a further perturbed environment in AD. The observed cytokine profiles may serve as diagnostic biomarkers in dementia.

21975314|t|Lentivirus-mediated APP695-RNAi reduces apoptosis in APP transgenic mouse neurons.
21975314|a|Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is a cleavage product of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is thought to be important in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent evidence suggests that Abeta induces neuronal apoptosis in the brain and in primary neuronal cultures. If decreased Abeta whether could reduce the neuronal apoptosis? In this study, APP695-siRNA was delivered to hippocampal and cortical neurons of APP695 transgenic mice (AD model) in vitro using a recombinant lentivirus vector. The results show that lentivirus-mediated RNA interference of the APP695 gene could reduce neuronal apoptosis, possibly through the reduction of caspase-3 activity and the neuronal apoptosis pathway. These results suggest that lentivirus-mediated RNA interference may be a potential therapeutic for AD.

21987394|a|BACKGROUND: Gantenerumab is a fully human anti-Abeta monoclonal antibody in clinical development for the treatment of Alzheimer disease (AD). OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether treatment with gantenerumab leads to a measurable reduction in the level of Abeta amyloid in the brain and to elucidate the mechanism of amyloid reduction. DESIGN: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending-dose positron emission tomographic study. Additionally, ex vivo studies of human brain slices from an independent sample of patients who had AD were performed. SETTING: Three university medical centers. PATIENTS: Patients with mild-to-moderate AD. INTERVENTION: Two consecutive cohorts of patients received 2 to 7 infusions of intravenous gantenerumab (60 or 200 mg) or placebo every 4 weeks. Brain slices from patients who had AD were coincubated with gantenerumab at increasing concentrations and with human microglial cells. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Percent change in the ratio of regional carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B retention in vivo and semiquantitative assessment of gantenerumab-induced phagocytosis ex vivo. RESULTS: Sixteen patients with end-of-treatment positron emission tomographic scans were included in the analysis. The mean (95% CI) percent change from baseline difference relative to placebo (n = 4) in cortical brain amyloid level was -15.6% (95% CI, -42.7 to 11.6) for the 60-mg group (n = 6) and -35.7% (95% CI, -63.5 to -7.9) for the 200-mg group (n = 6). Two patients in the 200-mg group showed transient and focal areas of inflammation or vasogenic edema on magnetic resonance imaging scans at sites with the highest level of amyloid reduction. Gantenerumab induced phagocytosis of human amyloid in a dose-dependent manner ex vivo. CONCLUSION: Gantenerumab treatment resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in brain amyloid level, possibly through an effector cell-mediated mechanism of action.

21989385|t|Quantitative modelling of amyloidogenic processing and its influence by SORLA in Alzheimer's disease.
21989385|a|The extent of proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) into neurotoxic amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides is central to the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Accordingly, modifiers that increase Abeta production rates are risk factors in the sporadic form of AD. In a novel systems biology approach, we combined quantitative biochemical studies with mathematical modelling to establish a kinetic model of amyloidogenic processing, and to evaluate the influence by SORLA/SORL1, an inhibitor of APP processing and important genetic risk factor. Contrary to previous hypotheses, our studies demonstrate that secretases represent allosteric enzymes that require cooperativity by APP oligomerization for efficient processing. Cooperativity enables swift adaptive changes in secretase activity with even small alterations in APP concentration. We also show that SORLA prevents APP oligomerization both in cultured cells and in the brain in vivo, eliminating the preferred form of the substrate and causing secretases to switch to a less efficient non-allosteric mode of action. These data represent the first mathematical description of the contribution of genetic risk factors to AD substantiating the relevance of subtle changes in SORLA levels for amyloidogenic processing as proposed for patients carrying SORL1 risk alleles.

21993310|t|S14G-humanin improves cognitive deficits and reduces amyloid pathology in the middle-aged APPswe/PS1dE9 mice.
21993310|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by clinical cognitive decline and pathological deposition of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) in the brain. So far, there has been no causative therapy for this devastating disease. S14G-Humanin (HNG), a synthetic derivative of Humanin (HN), has been shown to have strong neuroprotective ability against AD-related insults in vitro and prevent cognitive impairments in Abeta-infused animal models. In addition, a recent study has reported a beneficial effect of intranasal HNG treatment on memory deficit and Abeta accumulation in triple transgenic (3xTg-AD) mice at the early plaque-bearing stage. However, whether HNG treatment has the disease-modifying efficacy on AD with pre-existing well-established amyloid plaque pathology remains unclear. In this study, we employed 9-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 mice with pre-existing robust amyloid plaque pathology to investigate the effects of chronic HNG treatment on the progression of cognitive dysfunction and Abeta-associated neuropathology. We found that vehicle-treated APPswe/PS1dE9 mice showed impaired spatial learning and memory compared with vehicle- and HNG-treated wild-type mice, while intraperitoneal HNG treatment for 3 months significantly improved spatial learning and memory deficits in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice compared with vehicle control treatment. Coincidental with this, HNG treatment significantly reduced cerebral Abeta plaque deposition, insoluble Abeta levels, and neuroinflammatory responses in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice compared with control treatment. Cumulatively, these findings demonstrate that chronic administration of HNG is able to attenuate cognitive deficits and reduce Abeta loads as well as neuroinflammation in the middle-aged APPswe/PS1dE9 mice even with pre-existing substantial Abeta neuropathology, indicating that HNG has potential as a pharmacotherapeutic intervention in the development of cognitive deficits and neuropathology seen in the cases of established AD.

21994365|t|Soluble Abeta seeds are potent inducers of cerebral beta-amyloid deposition.
21994365|a|Cerebral beta-amyloidosis and associated pathologies can be exogenously induced by the intracerebral injection of small amounts of pathogenic Abeta-containing brain extract into young beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice. The probable beta-amyloid-inducing factor in the brain extract has been identified as a species of aggregated Abeta that is generated in its most effective conformation or composition in vivo. Here we report that Abeta in the brain extract is more proteinase K (PK) resistant than is synthetic fibrillar Abeta, and that this PK-resistant fraction of the brain extract retains the capacity to induce beta-amyloid deposition upon intracerebral injection in young, pre-depositing APP23 transgenic mice. After ultracentrifugation of the brain extract, <0.05% of the Abeta remained in the supernatant fraction, and these soluble Abeta species were largely PK sensitive. However, upon intracerebral injection, this soluble fraction accounted for up to 30% of the beta-amyloid induction observed with the unfractionated extract. Fragmentation of the Abeta seeds by extended sonication increased the seeding capacity of the brain extract. In summary, these results suggest that multiple Abeta assemblies, with various PK sensitivities, are capable of inducing beta-amyloid aggregation in vivo. The finding that small and soluble Abeta seeds are potent inducers of cerebral beta-amyloidosis raises the possibility that such seeds may mediate the spread of beta-amyloidosis in the brain. If they can be identified in vivo, soluble Abeta seeds in bodily fluids also could serve as early biomarkers for cerebral beta-amyloidogenesis and eventually Alzheimer's disease.

21994399|t|MicroRNA-137/181c regulates serine palmitoyltransferase and in turn amyloid beta, novel targets in sporadic Alzheimer's disease.
21994399|a|The contribution of mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin (PSEN) to familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) is well established. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms leading to amyloid beta (Abeta) generation in sporadic AD. Increased brain ceramide levels have been associated with sporadic AD, and are a suggested risk factor. Serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) is the first rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo ceramide synthesis. However, the regulation of SPT is not yet understood. Evidence suggests that it may be posttranscriptionally regulated. Therefore, we investigated the role of miRNAs in the regulation of SPT and amyloid beta (Abeta) generation. We show that SPT is upregulated in a subgroup of sporadic AD patient brains. This is further confirmed in mouse model studies of risk factors associated with AD. We identified that the loss of miR-137, -181c, -9, and 29a/b-1 increases SPT and in turn Abeta levels, and provides a mechanism for the elevated risk of AD associated with age, high-saturated-fat diet, and gender. Finally, these results suggest SPT and the respective miRNAs may be potential therapeutic targets for sporadic AD.

21995332|t|Inhibition of amyloid peptide fragment Abeta25-35 fibrillogenesis and toxicity by N-terminal beta-amino acid-containing esapeptides: is taurine moiety essential for in vivo effects?
21995332|a|We report the synthesis and fibrillogenesis inhibiting activity of the new peptide derivatives 1-4, related to the pentapeptide Ac-LPFFD-NH(2)  (iAbeta5p), proposed by Soto and co-workers and widely recognized as one of the most active beta-sheet breaker agents. The Abeta(25-35)  fragment of the parent full-length Abeta(1-42)  was used as fibrillogenesis model. The activity of peptide derivatives 1-4 was tested in vitro by thioflavin T binding assay, far UV CD spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. Their ability to hinder the toxic effect of Abeta(25-35) in vivo was studied by monitoring the viability of human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and the prevention of superoxide anion radical release from BV2 microglial cells. The results point to a favourable role in the fibrillogenesis inhibitory activity of the sulphonamide junction for compounds 1 and 2, containing an N,N-dimethyltaurine and a taurine amino-terminal moiety, respectively. Furthermore, compounds 1 and 2 show a significant protective effect on cell viability, rescuing the cells from the toxicity exerted by Abeta(25-35)  treatment.

21995460|t|Metabolism-directed design of oxetane-containing arylsulfonamide derivatives as gamma-secretase inhibitors.
21995460|a|A metabolism-based approach toward the optimization of a series of N-arylsulfonamide-based gamma-secretase inhibitors is reported. The lead cyclohexyl analogue 6 suffered from extensive oxidation on the cycloalkyl motif by cytochrome P450 3A4, translating into poor human liver microsomal stability. Knowledge of the metabolic pathways of 6 triggered a structure-activity relationship study aimed at lowering lipophilicity through the introduction of polarity. This effort led to several tetrahydropyran and tetrahydrofuran analogues, wherein the 3- and 4-substituted variants exhibited greater microsomal stability relative to their 2-substituted counterparts. Further reduction in lipophilicity led to the potent gamma-secretase inhibitor and 3-substituted oxetane 1 with a reduced propensity toward oxidative metabolism, relative to its 2-substituted isomer. The slower rates of metabolism with 3-substituted cyclic ethers most likely originate from reductions in lipophilicity and/or unfavorable CYP active site interactions with the heteroatom. Preliminary animal pharmacology studies with a representative oxetane indicate that the series is generally capable of lowering Abeta in vivo. As such, the study also illustrates the improvement in druglikeness of molecules through the use of the oxetane motif.

21998304|t|Testing the therapeutic potential of doxycycline in a Drosophila melanogaster model of Alzheimer disease.
21998304|a|Therapies for Alzheimer disease that reduce the production of pathogenic amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides have been associated with a range of unwanted effects. For this reason, alternative strategies that promote the clearance of the peptide by preventing its aggregation and deposition in the brain have been favored. In this context we have studied doxycycline, a member of the tetracycline family of antibiotics that has shown neuroprotective effects in a number of models of neurodegenerative disease. We investigated the neuroprotective potential of doxycycline in a Drosophila model of Abeta toxicity and sought to correlate any effects with the aggregation state of the peptide. We found that administration of doxycycline to Abeta42-expressing flies did not improve their lifespan but was able to slow the progression of their locomotor deficits. We also measured the rough eye phenotype of transgenic flies expressing the E22G variant of Abeta42 and showed that doxycycline administration partially rescued the toxicity of Abeta in the developing eye. We correlated these in vivo effects with in vitro observations using transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, and thioflavin T binding. We found that doxycycline prevents Abeta fibrillization and favors the generation of smaller, non-amyloid structures that were non-toxic as determined by the lack of caspase 3 activation in a neuroblastoma cell line.

21998317|t|Predicting MCI outcome with clinically available MRI and CSF biomarkers.
21998317|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the ability of clinically available volumetric MRI (vMRI) and CSF biomarkers, alone or in combination with a quantitative learning measure, to predict conversion to Alzheimer disease (AD) in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: We stratified 192 MCI participants into positive and negative risk groups on the basis of 1) degree of learning impairment on the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test; 2) medial temporal atrophy, quantified from Food and Drug Administration-approved software for automated vMRI analysis; and 3) CSF biomarker levels(.) We also stratified participants based on combinations of risk factors. We computed Cox proportional hazards models, controlling for age, to assess 3-year risk of converting to AD as a function of risk group and used Kaplan-Meier analyses to determine median survival times. RESULTS: When risk factors were examined separately, individuals testing positive showed significantly higher risk of converting to AD than individuals testing negative (hazard ratios [HR] 1.8-4.1). The joint presence of any 2 risk factors substantially increased risk, with the combination of greater learning impairment and increased atrophy associated with highest risk (HR 29.0): 85% of patients with both risk factors converted to AD within 3 years, vs 5% of those with neither. The presence of medial temporal atrophy was associated with shortest median dementia-free survival (15 months). CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating quantitative assessment of learning ability along with vMRI or CSF biomarkers in the clinical workup of MCI can provide critical information on risk of imminent conversion to AD.

21999410|t|Novel antibody capture assay for paraffin-embedded tissue detects wide-ranging amyloid beta and paired helical filament-tau accumulation in cognitively normal older adults.
21999410|a|Quantifying antigens in formalin-fixed tissue is challenging and limits investigation in population-based studies of brain aging. To address this major limitation, we have developed a new technique that we call "Histelide": immunohistochemistry (HIST-) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (-EL-) performed on a glass slide (-IDE). We validated Histelide in sections of prefrontal cortex from 20 selected cases: 12 subjects with clinically and neuropathologically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (AD), either autosomal dominant or late-onset forms, and 8 clinical and neuropathologic controls. AD cases had significantly increased amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide and paired helical filament- (PHF-) tau per area of neocortex that was proteinase K-sensitive, and significantly decreased amount of synaptophysin. We next investigated prefrontal cortex from 81 consecutive cases of high-cognitive performers from the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study, a population-based study of brain aging and incident dementia. As expected, latent AD was common in this group; however, our results quantified widely individually varying levels of Abeta peptides and PHF-tau among these high-cognitive performers. This novel approach obtains quantitative data from population-based studies, and our initial studies with high-cognitive performers provide important quantitative insights into latent AD that should help guide expectations from neuroimaging and prevention studies.

22001921|t|Amyloid protein-mediated differential DNA methylation status regulates gene expression in Alzheimer's disease model cell line.
22001921|a|The Swedish mutation of amyloid precursor protein (APP-sw) has been reported to dramatically increase beta amyloid production through aberrant cleavage at the beta secretase site, causing early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). DNA methylation has been reported to be associated with AD pathogenesis, but the underlying molecular mechanism of APP-sw-mediated epigenetic alterations in AD pathogenesis remains largely unknown. We analyzed genome-wide interplay between promoter CpG DNA methylation and gene expression in an APP-sw-expressing AD model cell line. To identify genes whose expression was regulated by DNA methylation status, we performed integrated analysis of CpG methylation and mRNA expression profiles, and identified three target genes of the APP-sw mutant; hypomethylated CTIF (CBP80/CBP20-dependent translation initiation factor) and NXT2 (nuclear exporting factor 2), and hypermethylated DDR2 (discoidin domain receptor 2). Treatment with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restored mRNA expression of these three genes, implying methylation-dependent transcriptional regulation. The profound alteration in the methylation status was detected at the -435, -295, and -271 CpG sites of CTIF, and at the -505 to -341 region in the promoter of DDR2. In the promoter region of NXT2, only one CpG site located at -432 was differentially unmethylated in APP-sw cells. Thus, we demonstrated the effect of the APP-sw mutation on alteration of DNA methylation and subsequent gene expression. This epigenetic regulatory mechanism may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD.

22002055|t|Complex regulation of p73 isoforms after alteration of amyloid precursor polypeptide (APP) function and DNA damage in neurons.
22002055|a|Genetic ablations of p73 have shown its implication in the development of the nervous system. However, the relative contribution of DeltaNp73 and TAp73 isoforms in neuronal functions is still unclear. In this study, we have analyzed the expression of these isoforms during neuronal death induced by alteration of the amyloid-beta precursor protein function or cisplatin. We observed a concomitant up-regulation of a TAp73 isoform and a down-regulation of a DeltaNp73 isoform. The shift in favor of the pro-apoptotic isoform correlated with an induction of the p53/p73 target genes such as Noxa. At a functional level, we showed that TAp73 induced neuronal death and that DeltaNp73 has a neuroprotective role toward amyloid-beta precursor protein alteration or cisplatin. We investigated the mechanisms of p73 expression and found that the TAp73 expression was regulated at the promoter level. In contrast, regulation of DeltaNp73 protein levels was regulated by phosphorylation at residue 86 and multiple proteases. Thus, this study indicates that tight transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms regulate the p73 isoform ratios that play an important role in neuronal survival.

22002568|t|Huperzine A alleviates synaptic deficits and modulates amyloidogenic and nonamyloidogenic pathways in APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice.
22002568|a|Huperzine A (HupA) is a potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, HupA was shown to be active in modulating the nonamyloidogenic metabolism of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) in APP-transfected human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293swe). However, in vivo research concerning the mechanism of HupA in APP transgenic mice has not yet been fully elucidated. The present study indicates that the loss of dendritic spine density and synaptotagmin levels in the brain of APPswe/presenilin-1 (PS1) transgenic mice was significantly ameliorated by chronic HupA treatment and provides evidence that this neuroprotection was associated with reduced amyloid plaque burden and oligomeric beta-amyloid (Abeta) levels in the cortex and hippocampus of APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice. Our findings further demonstrate that the amelioration effect of HupA on Abeta deposits may be mediated, at least in part, by regulation of the compromised expression of a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10) and excessive membrane trafficking of beta-site APP cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE1) in these transgenic mice. In addition, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (Erk1/2) phosphorylation may also be partially involved in the effect of HupA on APP processing. In conclusion, our work for the first time demonstrates the neuroprotective effect of HupA on synaptic deficits in APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice and further clarifies the potential pharmacological targets for this protective effect, in which modulation of nonamyloidogenic and amyloidogenic APP processing pathways may be both involved. These findings may provide adequate evidence for the clinical and experimental benefits gained from HupA treatment.

22006270|t|The role of APP and APLP for synaptic transmission, plasticity, and network function: lessons from genetic mouse models.
22006270|a|APP, APLP1, and APLP2 form a family of mammalian membrane proteins with unknown function. APP, however, plays a key role in the molecular pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), indicating that it is somehow involved in synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, memory formation, and maintenance of neurons. At present, most of our knowledge about the function of APP comes from consequences of AD-related mutations. The native role of APP, and even more of APLP1/2, remains largely unknown. New genetic knockout and knockin models involving several members of the APP/APLP family may yield better insight into the synaptic and systemic functions of these proteins. Here, we summarize recent results from such transgenic animals with special emphasis on synaptic plasticity and coherent patterns of memory-related network activity in the hippocampus. Data from APP knockout mice suggest that this protein is needed for the expression of long-term potentiation (LTP) in aged, but not in juvenile mice. The missing function can be rescued by expressing part of the protein, as well as by blocking inhibition. Double knockout mice lacking APP and APLP2 die shortly after birth indicating that different members of the APP/APLP family can mutually compensate for genetic ablation of single proteins. Recent techniques allow for analysis of tissue with combined defects, e.g., by expressing only part of APP in APLP2 knockout mice or by growing stem cells with multiple deletions on normal slice cultures. Data from these experiments confirm that APP and APLP2 do indeed play an important role in synaptic plasticity. Much less is known about the role of APP/APLP at the network level. Coherent patterns of activity like hippocampal network oscillations are believed to support formation and consolidation of memory. Analysis of such activity patterns in tissue from mice with altered expression of APP/APLP has just started and may shed further light on the importance of these proteins for cognitive functions.

22009041|t|Association between frontal cortex oxidative damage and beta-amyloid as a function of age in Down syndrome.
22009041|a|Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability in children, and the number of adults with DS reaching old age is increasing. By the age of 40 years, virtually all people with DS have sufficient neuropathology for a postmortem diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD). Trisomy 21 in DS leads to an overexpression of many proteins, of which at least two are involved in oxidative stress and AD: superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and amyloid precursor protein (APP). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that DS brains with neuropathological hallmarks of AD have more oxidative and nitrosative stress than those with DS but without significant AD pathology, as compared with similarly aged-matched non-DS controls. The frontal cortex was examined in 70 autopsy cases (n=29 control and n=41 DS). By ELISA, we quantified soluble and insoluble Abeta40 and Abeta42, as well as oligomers. Oxidative and nitrosative stress levels (protein carbonyls, 4-hydroxy-2-trans-nonenal (HNE)-bound proteins, and 3-nitrotyrosine) were measured by slot-blot. We found that soluble and insoluble amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) and oligomers increase as a function of age in DS frontal cortex. Of the oxidative stress markers, HNE-bound proteins were increased overall in DS. Protein carbonyls were correlated with Abeta40 levels. These results suggest that oxidative damage, but not nitrosative stress, may contribute to the onset and progression of AD pathogenesis in DS. Conceivably, treatment with antioxidants may provide a point of intervention to slow pathological alterations in DS.

22014620|t|Early development of social deficits in APP and APP-PS1 mice.
22014620|a|Mimicking relevant behavioral features of the human pathology is one of the most important challenges for animal models of neurological disorders including Alzheimer disease (AD). Indeed, the most popular genetic AD mouse lines bearing mutations of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 genes (PS1), often fail to present robust cognitive deficits or show them only at very advanced ages. It is therefore crucial to identify AD-like behavioral alterations which may reliably reflect the early stages of the pathology, thus permitting tests of more efficient early therapeutic interventions. Here, we demonstrated the very early expression of noncognitive AD-like symptoms, i.e., deficits in social interest, interaction and communication, in APP and APP-PS1 transgenic mice. Conversely, other noncognitive behaviors (sensori-motor gating) as well as cognitive abilities (spontaneous alternation) were unaltered in AD transgenics. Our data suggest that social deficits precede other neuropsychiatric and cognitive AD-like symptoms and can be employed as early markers of AD pathology in genetic mouse models.

22015470|t|Multi-faced neuroprotective effects of Ginsenoside Rg1 in an Alzheimer mouse model.
22015470|a|There has been no extensive characterization of the effects of Ginsenoside Rg1, a pharmacological active component purified from the nature product ginseng, in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model. The well-characterized transgenic Alzheimer disease (AD) mice over expressing amyloid precursor protein (APP)/Abeta (Tg mAPP) and nontransgenic (nonTg) littermates at age of 6 and 9 months were treated with Rg 1 for three months via intraperitoneal injection. Mice were then evaluated for changes in amyloid pathology, neuropathology and behavior. Tg mAPP treated with Rg1 showed a significant reduction of cerebral Abeta levels, reversal of certain neuropathological changes, and preservation of spatial learning and memory, as compared to vehicle-treated mice. Rg1 treatment inhibited activity of gamma-secretase in both Tg mAPP mice and B103-APP cells, indicating the involvement of Rg1 in APP regulation pathway. Furthermore, administration of Rg1 enhanced PKA/CREB pathway activation in mAPP mice and in cultured cortical neurons exposed to Abeta or glutamate-mediated synaptic stress. Most importantly, the beneficial effects on attenuation of cerebral Abeta accumulation, improvement in neuropathological and behavioral changes can be extended to the aged mAPP mice, even to 12-13 months old mice that had extensive amyloid pathology and severe neuropathological and cognitive malfunction. These studies indicate that Rg1 has profound multi-faced and neuroprotective effects in an AD mouse model. Rg1 induces neuroprotection through ameliorating amyloid pathology, modulating APP process, improving cognition, and activating PKA/CREB signaling. These findings provide a new perspective for the treatment of AD and demonstrate potential for a new class of drugs for AD treatment.

22015609|t|Soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1 secreted by human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cell reduces amyloid-beta plaques.
22015609|a|Presently, co-culture of human umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB-MSCs) with BV2 microglia under amyloid-beta42 (Abeta42) exposure induced a reduction of Abeta42 in the medium as well as an overexpression of the Abeta-degrading enzyme neprilysin (NEP) in microglia. Cytokine array examinations of co-cultured media revealed elevated release of soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) from hUCB-MSCs. Administration of human recombinant ICAM-1 in BV2 cells and wild-type mice brains induced NEP expression in time- and dose-dependent manners. In co-culturing with BV2 cells under Abeta42 exposure, knockdown of ICAM-1 expression on hUCB-MSCs by small interfering RNA (siRNA) abolished the induction of NEP in BV2 cells as well as reduction of added Abeta42 in the co-cultured media. By contrast, siRNA-mediated inhibition of the sICAM-1 receptor, lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), on BV2 cells reduced NEP expression by ICAM-1 exposure. When hUCB-MSCs were transplanted into the hippocampus of a 10-month-old transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease for 10, 20, or 40 days, NEP expression was increased in the mice brains. Moreover, Abeta42 plaques in the hippocampus and other regions were decreased by active migration of hUCB-MSCs toward Abeta deposits. These data suggest that hUCB-MSC-derived sICAM-1 decreases Abeta plaques by inducing NEP expression in microglia through the sICAM-1/LFA-1 signaling pathway.

22015920|t|Convergent pathogenic pathways in Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases: shared targets for drug development.
22015920|a|Neurodegenerative diseases, exemplified by Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease, are characterized by progressive neuropsychiatric dysfunction and loss of specific neuronal subtypes. Although there are differences in the exact sites of pathology, and the clinical profiles of these two conditions only partially overlap, considerable similarities in disease mechanisms and pathogenic pathways can be observed. These shared mechanisms raise the possibility of exploiting common therapeutic targets for drug development. As Huntington's disease has a monogenic cause, it is possible to accurately identify individuals who carry the Huntington's disease mutation but do not yet manifest symptoms. These individuals could act as a model for Alzheimer's disease to test therapeutic interventions that target shared pathogenic pathways.

22017494|t|Exogenous seeding of cerebral beta-amyloid deposition in betaAPP-transgenic rats.
22017494|a|Deposition of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide in senile plaques and cerebral Abeta angiopathy (CAA) can be stimulated in Abeta-precursor protein (APP)-transgenic mice by the intracerebral injection of dilute brain extracts containing aggregated Abeta seeds. Growing evidence implicates a prion-like mechanism of corruptive protein templating in this phenomenon, in which aggregated Abeta itself is the seed. Unlike prion disease, which can be induced de novo in animals that are unlikely to spontaneously develop the disease, previous experiments with Abeta seeding have employed animal models that, as they age, eventually will generate Abeta lesions in the absence of seeding. In the present study, we first established that a transgenic rat model expressing human APP (APP21 line) does not manifest endogenous deposits of Abeta within the course of its median lifespan (30 months). Next, we injected 3-month-old APP21 rats intrahippocampally with dilute Alzheimer brain extracts containing aggregated Abeta. After a 9-month incubation period, these rats had developed senile plaques and CAA in the injected hippocampus, whereas control rats remained free of such lesions. These findings underscore the co-dependence of agent and host in governing seeded protein aggregation, and show that cerebral Abeta-amyloidosis can be induced even in animals that are relatively refractory to the spontaneous origination of parenchymal and vascular deposits of Abeta.

22018341|t|BACE-1 inhibition prevents the gamma-secretase inhibitor evoked Abeta rise in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells.
22018341|a|BACKGROUND: Accumulation of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) in the plaques is one of the major pathological features in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1) and gamma-secretase results in the formation of Abeta peptides. Preventing Abeta formation is believed to attenuate AD progression and BACE-1 and gamma-secretase are thus attractive targets for AD drug development. METHODS: Combining BACE-1 and gamma-secretase inhibition on Abeta secretion from human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells was evaluated in this study. Secreted Abeta40 and Abeta42 levels were measured from SH-SY5Y cells stably transfected with APPwt or APPswe genes. A selective BACE inhibitor and the gamma-secretase inhibitor LY450139 (semagacestat) were used to inhibit respective secretase. RESULTS: LY450139 increased Abeta40 and Abeta42 secretion from SH-SY5Y APPwt cells at low concentrations (by 60% at 3 nM) followed by subsequent inhibition at higher concentrations (IC(50) 90 nM). Washout studies showed that the Abeta increase evoked by 3 nM LY450139 was not due to enhanced cleavage following substrate accumulation but rather to activation of Abeta formation. By contrast, LY450139 inhibited Abeta formation from SH-SY5Y APPswe in a monophasic manner (IC(50) 18 nM). The BACE inhibitor per se inhibited Abeta secretion from both SH-SY5Y APPwt and SH-SY5Y APPswe cells with IC(50)s ranging between 7 - 18 nM and also prevented the increased Abeta secretion evoked by 3 nM LY450139. Combining the BACE inhibitor with higher inhibitory concentrations of LY450139 failed to demonstrate any clear additive or synergistic effects. CONCLUSION: BACE-1 inhibition attenuates the Abeta increase evoked by LY450139 while not providing any obvious synergistic effects on LY450139-mediated inhibition.

22019329|t|High throughput object-based image analysis of beta-amyloid plaques in human and transgenic mouse brain.
22019329|a|Advances in imaging technology have enabled automated approaches for quantitative image analysis. In this study, a high content object based image analysis method was developed for quantification of beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques in postmortem brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects and in transgenic mice over overexpressing Abeta. Digital images acquired from immunohistochemically stained sections of the superior frontal gyrus were analyzed for Abeta plaque burden using a Definiens object-based segmentation approach. Blinded evaluation of Abeta stained sections from AD and aged matched human subjects accurately identified AD cases with one exception. Brains from transgenic mice overexpressing Abeta (PS1APP mice) were also evaluated by our Definiens object based image analysis approach. We observed an age-dependent increase in the amount of Abeta plaque load that we quantified in both the hippocampus and cortex. From the contralateral hemisphere, we measured the amount of Abeta in brain homogenates biochemically and observed a significant correlation between our biochemical measurements and those that we measured by our object based Definiens system in the hippocampus. Assessment of Abeta plaque load in PS1APP mice using a manual segmentation technique (Image-Pro Plus) confirmed the results of our object-based image analysis approach. Image acquisition and analysis of 32 stained human slides and 100 mouse slides were executed in 8 h and 22 h, respectively supporting the relatively high throughput features of the Definiens platform. The data show that digital imaging combined with object based image analysis is a reliable and efficient approach to quantifying Abeta plaques in human and mouse brain.

22020632|t|Apolipoprotein E level and cholesterol are associated with reduced synaptic amyloid beta in Alzheimer's disease and apoE TR mouse cortex.
22020632|a|The apolipoprotein E4 allele (APOE4) contributes to Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk and APOE2 is protective, but the relevant cellular mechanisms are unknown. We have used flow cytometry analysis to measure apolipoprotein E (apoE) and amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) levels in large populations of synaptic terminals from AD and aged cognitively normal controls, and demonstrate that modest but significant increases in soluble apoE levels accompany elevated Abeta in AD cortical synapses and in an APP/PS1 rat model of AD. Dual labeling experiments document co-localization of apoE and Abeta in individual synapses with concentration of Abeta in a small population of apoE-positive synapses in both AD and controls. Consistent with a clearance role, the apoE level was higher in Abeta-positive synapses in control cases. In aged targeted replacement mice expressing human apoE, apoE2/4 synaptic terminals demonstrated the highest level of apoE and the lowest level of Abeta compared to apoE3/3 and apoE4/4 lines. In apoE2/4 terminals, the pattern of immunolabeling for apoE and Abeta closely resembled the pattern in human control cases, and elevated apoE was accompanied by elevated free cholesterol in apoE2/4 synaptic terminals. These results are consistent with a role for APOE in Abeta clearance in AD synapses, and suggest that optimal lipidation of apoE2 compared to E3 and E4 makes an important contribution to Abeta clearance and synaptic function.

22023354|t|Measurement of Abeta1-42 in cerebrospinal fluid is influenced by matrix effects.
22023354|a|Abeta1-42 measurement in CSF is an important biochemical marker for Alzheimer disease (AD). However, our understanding of why this biomarker is predictive and why it is often difficult to measure in a reproducible fashion is still lacking. To study these questions, the concentration of Abeta1-42 in CSF was compared before and after denaturation with 6M guanidine and reverse-phase HPLC. Measurement of the Abeta1-42 after denaturation and reverse-phase HPLC demonstrated that considerably more Abeta1-42 was present in CSF than revealed when assaying non-denatured CSF. A comparison of Abeta1-42 concentrations before and after HPLC in AD CSF with that in normal controls suggested that matrix interference may affect the differentiation between the diagnostic groups. A similar effect was observed with dilutions of crude CSF. Together, these results suggested that at least part of the mechanism by which low Abeta1-42 concentrations in CSF function as a biomarker of AD is related to matrix components which preferentially hide a portion of the Abeta1-42 from detection in AD CSF. In contrast, we show that the association of the APOEepsilon4 allele with lower Abeta1-42 concentrations in CSF is preserved even after denaturation and HPLC. A similar relationship between the presence of the APOEepsilon4 allele and lower concentrations of Abeta1-40 was also apparent, thereby generating similar ratios of Abeta1-42/ Abeta1-40 across the APOE genotypes. The results from the present study suggested that Abeta1-42 in CSF functions as a biomarker of AD in tandem with other CSF matrix components that are increased in AD CSF. Further studies are needed to identify which matrix factors (e.g. binding of Abeta to proteins) underlie the increased detection of Abeta1-42 concentrations after denaturation and HPLC. The data also suggested that denaturation and HPLC of CSF may be a useful approach for studies using Abeta1-42 as a pharmacodynamic marker or in other paradigms where measurement of total non-covalently bound Abeta1-42 is required.

22024165|t|Single-channel Ca(2+) imaging implicates Abeta1-42 amyloid pores in Alzheimer's disease pathology.
22024165|a|Oligomeric forms of Abeta peptides are implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and disrupt membrane integrity, leading to cytosolic calcium (Ca(2+)) elevation. Proposed mechanisms by which Abeta mediates its effects include lipid destabilization, activation of native membrane channels, and aggregation of Abeta into Ca(2+)-permeable pores. We distinguished between these using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to image Ca(2+) influx in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Abeta1-42 oligomers evoked single-channel Ca(2+) fluorescence transients (SCCaFTs), which resembled those from classical ion channels but which were not attributable to endogenous oocyte channels. SCCaFTs displayed widely variable open probabilities (P(o)) and stepwise transitions among multiple amplitude levels reminiscent of subconductance levels of ion channels. The proportion of high P(o), large amplitude SCCaFTs grew with time, suggesting that continued oligomer aggregation results in the formation of highly toxic pores. We conclude that formation of intrinsic Ca(2+)-permeable membrane pores is a major pathological mechanism in AD and introduce TIRF imaging for massively parallel single-channel studies of the incorporation, assembly, and properties of amyloidogenic oligomers.

22028219|t|Pathogenic protein seeding in Alzheimer disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.
22028219|a|The misfolding and aggregation of specific proteins is a seminal occurrence in a remarkable variety of neurodegenerative disorders. In Alzheimer disease (the most prevalent cerebral proteopathy), the two principal aggregating proteins are beta-amyloid (Abeta) and tau. The abnormal assemblies formed by conformational variants of these proteins range in size from small oligomers to the characteristic lesions that are visible by optical microscopy, such as senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Pathologic similarities with prion disease suggest that the formation and spread of these proteinaceous lesions might involve a common molecular mechanism-corruptive protein templating. Experimentally, cerebral beta-amyloidosis can be exogenously induced by exposure to dilute brain extracts containing aggregated Abeta seeds. The amyloid-inducing agent probably is Abeta itself, in a conformation generated most effectively in the living brain. Once initiated, Abeta lesions proliferate within and among brain regions. The induction process is governed by the structural and biochemical nature of the Abeta seed, as well as the attributes of the host, reminiscent of pathogenically variant prion strains. The concept of prionlike induction and spreading of pathogenic proteins recently has been expanded to include aggregates of tau, alpha-synuclein, huntingtin, superoxide dismutase-1, and TDP-43, which characterize such human neurodegenerative disorders as frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Parkinson/Lewy body disease, Huntington disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our recent finding that the most effective Abeta seeds are small and soluble intensifies the search in bodily fluids for misfolded protein seeds that are upstream in the proteopathic cascade, and thus could serve as predictive diagnostics and the targets of early, mechanism-based interventions. Establishing the clinical implications of corruptive protein templating will require further mechanistic and epidemiologic investigations. However, the theory that many chronic neurodegenerative diseases can originate and progress via the seeded corruption of misfolded proteins has the potential to unify experimental and translational approaches to these increasingly prevalent disorders.

22030550|t|Cerebrovascular disorders: molecular insights and therapeutic opportunities.
22030550|a|Blood vessels in the nervous system have traditionally been considered neutral bystanders that only passively adapt their structure and function in response to the needs of neural cells. Emerging evidence suggests, however, that vessels and angiogenic molecules actively participate in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. Here we will discuss molecular insights into neurological disorders resulting either from excessive vessel growth (cerebral vascular malformations) or improper vessel regression (neurodegeneration and white matter lesions). These genetic insights offer alternative therapeutic options, some of which are being evaluated in the clinic.

22031884|t|Impaired beta-amyloid secretion in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.
22031884|a|A central question in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research is what role beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) plays in synaptic dysfunction. Synaptic activity increases Abeta secretion, potentially inhibiting synapses, but also decreases intraneuronal Abeta, protecting synapses. We now show that levels of secreted Abeta fall with time in culture in neurons of AD-transgenic mice, but not wild-type mice. Moreover, the ability of synaptic activity to elevate secreted Abeta and reduce intraneuronal Abeta becomes impaired in AD-transgenic but not wild-type neurons with time in culture. We demonstrate that synaptic activity promotes an increase in the Abeta-degrading protease neprilysin at the cell surface and a concomitant increase in colocalization with Abeta42. Remarkably, AD-transgenic but not wild-type neurons show reduced levels of neprilysin with time in culture. This impaired ability to secrete Abeta and reduce intraneuronal Abeta has important implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of AD.

22035591|t|Glycosaminoglycans from aged human hippocampus have altered capacities to regulate trophic factors activities but not Abeta42 peptide toxicity.
22035591|a|Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are major extracellular matrix components known to tightly regulate cell behavior by interacting with tissue effectors as trophic factors and other heparin binding proteins. Alterations of GAGs structures might thus modify the nature and extent of these interactions and alter tissue integrity. Here, we studied levels and composition of GAGs isolated from adult and aged human hippocampus and investigated if their changes can influence the function of important trophic factors and the Abeta42 peptide toxicity. Biochemical analyses showed that heparan sulfates are increased in the aged hippocampus. Moreover, GAGs from aged hippocampus showed altered capacities to regulate trophic factor activities without changing their capacities to protect cells from Abeta42 toxicity, compared to adult hippocampus GAGs. Structural alterations in GAGs from elderly were suggested by differential transcripts levels of key biosynthetic enzymes. C5-epimerase and 2-OST expressions were decreased while NDST-2 and 3-OST-4 were increased; in contrast, heparanase expression was unchanged. Results suggest that alteration of GAGs in hippocampus of aged subjects could participate to tissue impairment during aging.

22036569|t|Arc/Arg3.1 regulates an endosomal pathway essential for activity-dependent beta-amyloid generation.
22036569|a|Assemblies of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides are pathological mediators of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and are produced by the sequential cleavages of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-secretase (BACE1) and gamma-secretase. The generation of Abeta is coupled to neuronal activity, but the molecular basis is unknown. Here, we report that the immediate early gene Arc is required for activity-dependent generation of Abeta. Arc is a postsynaptic protein that recruits endophilin2/3 and dynamin to early/recycling endosomes that traffic AMPA receptors to reduce synaptic strength in both hebbian and non-hebbian forms of plasticity. The Arc-endosome also traffics APP and BACE1, and Arc physically associates with presenilin1 (PS1) to regulate gamma-secretase trafficking and confer activity dependence. Genetic deletion of Arc reduces Abeta load in a transgenic mouse model of AD. In concert with the finding that patients with AD can express anomalously high levels of Arc, we hypothesize that Arc participates in the pathogenesis of AD.

22036964|t|Notch signaling proteins HES-1 and Hey-1 bind to insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) proximal promoter and repress its transcription and activity: implications for cellular Abeta metabolism.
22036964|a|Cerebral amyloid beta (Abeta) accumulation is pathogenically associated with sporadic Alzheimer's disease (SAD). BACE-1 is involved in Abeta generation while insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) partakes in Abeta proteolytic clearance. Vulnerable regions in AD brains show increased BACE-1 protein levels and enzymatic activity while the opposite occurs with IDE. Another common feature in SAD brains is Notch1 overexpression. Here we demonstrate an increase in mRNA levels of Hey-1, a Notch target gene, and a decrease of IDE transcripts in the hippocampus of SAD brains as compared to controls. Transient transfection of Notch intracellular domain (NICD) in N2aSW cells, mouse neuroblastoma cells (N2a) stably expressing human amyloid precursor protein (APP) Swedish mutation, reduce IDE mRNA levels, promoting extracellular Abeta accumulation. Also, NICD, HES-1 and Hey-1 overexpression result in decreased IDE proximal promoter activity. This effect was mediated by 2 functional sites located at -379/-372 and -310-303 from the first translation start site in the -575/-19 (556 bp) fragment of IDE proximal promoter. By site-directed mutagenesis of the IDE promoter region we reverted the inhibitory effect mediated by NICD transfection suggesting that these sites are indeed responsible for the Notch-mediated inhibition of the IDE gene expression. Intracranial injection of the Notch ligand JAG-1 in Tg2576 mice, expressing the Swedish mutation in human APP, induced overexpression of HES-1 and Hey-1 and reduction of IDE mRNA levels, respectively. Our results support our theory that a Notch-dependent IDE transcriptional modulation may impact on Abeta metabolism providing a functional link between Notch signaling and the amyloidogenic pathway in SAD.

22037136|t|Transient increase of plasma concentrations of amyloid beta peptides after electroconvulsive therapy.
22037136|a|BACKGROUND: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is applied to effectively treat depressive episodes, and it can be considered an ideal model of generalized seizures induced and performed under precisely controllable conditions. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesize that ECT causes a transiently increased blood-brain barrier permeability. METHODS: We measured plasma concentrations of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides: 1-42, 1-40, x-42, and x-40 before ECT, within 30 minutes after 2, and 24 hours after ECT treatment in 33-36 sessions of n=13 different patients. RESULTS: We observed a significant increase of the plasma concentrations of all four peptides within 30 minutes after the ECT, followed by the normalization of the peptides concentrations 2 hours after the ECT. CONCLUSION: Different physiologic phenomena may be responsible for the transient increase of the Abeta peptides concentrations in plasma shortly after ECT session, and further studies are necessary to explain these mechanisms. For example, decreased integrity of the blood-brain barrier permeability, an increased release from neurons due to their activation or increased release from peripheral sources, like thrombocytes or muscles, or a combination of different factors must be taken into consideration.

22038715|t|Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism to study APP function.
22038715|a|The brains of Alzheimer's disease patients show an increased number of senile plaques compared with normal patients. The major component of the plaques is the beta-amyloid peptide, a cleavage product of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Although the processing of APP has been well-described, the physiological functions of APP and its cleavage products remain unclear. This article reviews the multifunctional roles of an APP orthologue, the C. elegans APL-1. Understanding the function of APL-1 may provide insights into the functions and signaling pathways of human APP. In addition, the physiological effects of introducing human beta-amyloid peptide into C. elegans are also reviewed. The C. elegans system provides a powerful genetic model to identify genes regulating the molecular mechanisms underlying intracellular beta-amyloid peptide accumulation.

22038908|t|CSF biomarker and PIB-PET-derived beta-amyloid signature predicts metabolic, gray matter, and cognitive changes in nondemented subjects.
22038908|a|Beta-amyloid (Abeta) is a histopathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease dementia, but high levels of Abeta in the brain can also be found in a substantial proportion of nondemented subjects. Here we investigated which 2-year rate of brain and cognitive changes are present in nondemented subjects with high and low Abeta levels, as assessed with cerebrospinal fluid and molecular positron emission tomography (PET)-based biomarkers of Abeta. In subjects with mild cognitive impairment, increased brain Abeta levels were associated with significantly faster cognitive decline, progression of gray matter atrophy within temporal and parietal brain regions, and a trend for a faster decline in parietal Fludeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET metabolism. Changes in gray matter and FDG-PET mediated the association between Abeta and cognitive decline. In contrast, elderly cognitively healthy controls (HC) with high Abeta levels showed only a faster medial temporal lobe and precuneus volume decline compared with HC with low Abeta. In conclusion, the current results suggest not only that both functional and volumetric brain changes are associated with high Abeta years before the onset of dementia but also that HC with substantial Abeta levels show higher Abeta pathology resistance, lack other pathologies that condition neurotoxic effects of Abeta, or accumulated Abeta for a shorter time period.

22044119|t|Design, synthesis, and qualitative structure-activity evaluations of novel beta-secretase inhibitors as potential Alzheimer's drug leads.
22044119|a|We have identified highly selective imidazopyridines armed with benzimidazol and/or arylimidazole as potent beta-secretase inhibitors. The most effective and selective analogues demonstrated low nanomolar potency for the BACE1 enzyme as measured by FRET and cell-based (ELISA) assays and exhibited comparable affinity (KI) and high ligand efficiency (LE). In addition, these motifs were highly selective (>200) against the structurally related aspartyl protease BACE2. Our design strategy followed a traditional SAR approach and was supported by molecular modeling studies based on the previously reported hydroxyethylene transition state inhibitor derived from isophthalic acid I. Of the most potent compounds, 34 displayed an IC50 for BACE1 of 18 nM and exhibited cellular activity with an EC50 of 37 nM in the cell-based ELISA assay, as well as high affinity (KI=17 nM) and ligand efficiency (LE=1.7 kJ/mol). Compound 34 was found to be 204-fold more selective for BACE1 compared to the closely related aspartyl protease BACE2.

22045115|t|Aluminium, iron and copper in human brain tissues donated to the Medical Research Council's Cognitive Function and Ageing Study.
22045115|a|Aluminium, iron and copper are all implicated in the aetiology of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease. However, there are very few large cohort studies of the content of these metals in aged human brains. We have used microwave digestion and TH GFAAS to measure aluminium, iron and copper in the temporal, frontal, occipital and parietal lobes of 60 brains donated to the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study. Every precaution was taken to reduce contamination of samples and acid digests to a minimum. Actual contamination was estimated by preparing a large number of (170+) method blanks which were interspersed within the full set of 700+ tissue digests. Subtraction of method blank values (MBV) from tissue digest values resulted in metal contents in all tissues in the range, MBV to 33 mug g(-1) dry wt. for aluminium, 112 to 8305 mug g(-1) dry wt. for iron and MBV to 384 mug g(-1) dry wt. for copper. While the median aluminium content for all tissues was 1.02 mug g(-1) dry wt. it was informative that 41 brains out of 60 included at least one tissue with an aluminium content which could be considered as potentially pathological (> 3.50 mug g(-1) dry wt.). The median content for iron was 286.16 mug g(-1) dry wt. and overall tissue iron contents were generally high which possibly reflected increased brain iron in ageing and in neurodegenerative disease. The median content for copper was 17.41 mug g(-1) dry wt. and overall tissue copper contents were lower than expected for aged brains but they were commensurate with aged brains showing signs of neurodegenerative disease. In this study we have shown, in particular, the value of carrying out significant numbers of method blanks to identify unknown sources of contamination. When these values are subtracted from tissue digest values the absolute metal contents could be considered as conservative and yet they may still reflect aspects of ageing and neurodegenerative disease in individual brains.

22047170|t|The contribution of activated astrocytes to Abeta production: implications for Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.
22047170|a|BACKGROUND: beta-Amyloid (Abeta) plays a central role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Neurons are major sources of Abeta in the brain. However, astrocytes outnumber neurons by at least five-fold. Thus, even a small level of astrocytic Abeta production could make a significant contribution to Abeta burden in AD. Moreover, activated astrocytes may increase Abeta generation. beta-Site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) initiates Abeta production. Here, we explored whether pro-inflammatory cytokines or Abeta42 would increase astrocytic levels of BACE1, APP, and beta-secretase processing, implying a feed-forward mechanism of astrocytic Abeta production. METHODS: Mouse primary astrocytes were treated with combinations of LPS, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and IL-1beta and analyzed by immunoblot and ELISA for endogenous BACE1, APP, and secreted Abeta40 levels. Inhibition of JAK and iNOS signaling in TNF-alpha+IFN-gamma-stimulated astrocytes was also analyzed. In addition, C57BL/6J or Tg2576 mouse astrocytes were treated with oligomeric or fibrillar Abeta42 and analyzed by immunoblot for levels of BACE1, APP, and APPsbetasw. Astrocytic BACE1 and APP mRNA levels were measured by TaqMan RT-PCR. RESULTS: TNF-alpha+IFN-gamma stimulation significantly increased levels of astrocytic BACE1, APP, and secreted Abeta40. BACE1 and APP elevations were post-transcriptional at early time-points, but became transcriptional with longer TNF-alpha+IFN-gamma treatment. Despite a ~4-fold increase in astrocytic BACE1 protein level following TNF-alpha+IFN-gamma stimulation, BACE1 mRNA level was significantly decreased suggesting a post-transcriptional mechanism. Inhibition of iNOS and JAK did not reduce TNF-alpha+IFN-gamma-stimulated elevation of astrocytic BACE1, APP, and Abeta40, except that JAK inhibition blocked the APP increase. Finally, oligomeric and fibrillar Abeta42 dramatically increased levels of astrocytic BACE1, APP, and APPsbetasw through transcriptional mechanisms, at least in part. CONCLUSIONS: Cytokines including TNF-alpha+IFN-gamma increase levels of endogenous BACE1, APP, and Abeta and stimulate amyloidogenic APP processing in astrocytes. Oligomeric and fibrillar Abeta42 also increase levels of astrocytic BACE1, APP, and beta-secretase processing. Together, our results suggest a cytokine- and Abeta42-driven feed-forward mechanism that promotes astrocytic Abeta production. Given that astrocytes greatly outnumber neurons, activated astrocytes may represent significant sources of Abeta during neuroinflammation in AD.

22047631|t|Standardization of preanalytical aspects of cerebrospinal fluid biomarker testing for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis: a consensus paper from the Alzheimer's Biomarkers Standardization Initiative.
22047631|a|BACKGROUND: Numerous studies show that the cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers total tau (T-tau), tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (P-tau(181P)), and amyloid-beta (1-42) (Abeta(1-42)) have high diagnostic accuracy for Alzheimer's disease. Variability in concentrations for Abeta(1-42), T-tau, and P-tau(181P) drives the need for standardization. METHODS: Key issues were identified and discussed before the first meeting of the members of the Alzheimer's Biomarkers Standardization Initiative (ABSI). Subsequent ABSI consensus meetings focused on preanalytical issues. RESULTS: Consensus was reached on preanalytical issues such as the effects of fasting, different tube types, centrifugation, time and temperature before storage, storage temperature, repeated freeze/thaw cycles, and length of storage on concentrations of Abeta(1-42), T-tau, and P-tau(181P) in cerebrospinal fluid. CONCLUSIONS: The consensus reached on preanalytical issues and the recommendations put forward during the ABSI consensus meetings are presented in this paper.

22047632|t|Is Alzheimer's disease amyloidosis the result of a repair mechanism gone astray?
22047632|a|Here, we synthesize several lines of evidence supporting the hypothesis that at least one function of amyloid-beta is to serve as a part of the acute response to brain hemodynamic disturbances intended to seal vascular leakage. Given the resilient and adhesive physicochemical properties of amyloid, an abluminal hemostatic repair system might be highly advantageous, if deployed on a limited and short-term basis, in young individuals. However, in the aged, inevitable cardiovascular dysfunction combined with brain microvascular lesions may yield global chronic hypoperfusion that may lead to continuous amyloid deposition and consequential negative effects on neuronal viability. A large body of experimental evidence supports the hypothesis of an amyloid-beta rescue function gone astray. Preventing or inducing the removal of amyloid in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been simultaneously successful and disappointing. Amyloid deposits clearly play major roles in AD, but they may not represent the preeminent factor in dementia pathogenesis. Successful application of AD preventative approaches may hinge on an accurate and comprehensive view of comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and head trauma.

22047634|t|The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative: a review of papers published since its inception.
22047634|a|The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is an ongoing, longitudinal, multicenter study designed to develop clinical, imaging, genetic, and biochemical biomarkers for the early detection and tracking of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study aimed to enroll 400 subjects with early mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 200 subjects with early AD, and 200 normal control subjects; $67 million funding was provided by both the public and private sectors, including the National Institute on Aging, 13 pharmaceutical companies, and 2 foundations that provided support through the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health. This article reviews all papers published since the inception of the initiative and summarizes the results as of February 2011. The major accomplishments of ADNI have been as follows: (1) the development of standardized methods for clinical tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in a multicenter setting; (2) elucidation of the patterns and rates of change of imaging and CSF biomarker measurements in control subjects, MCI patients, and AD patients. CSF biomarkers are consistent with disease trajectories predicted by beta-amyloid cascade (Hardy, J Alzheimers Dis 2006;9(Suppl 3):151-3) and tau-mediated neurodegeneration hypotheses for AD, whereas brain atrophy and hypometabolism levels show predicted patterns but exhibit differing rates of change depending on region and disease severity; (3) the assessment of alternative methods of diagnostic categorization. Currently, the best classifiers combine optimum features from multiple modalities, including MRI, [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, CSF biomarkers, and clinical tests; (4) the development of methods for the early detection of AD. CSF biomarkers, beta-amyloid 42 and tau, as well as amyloid PET may reflect the earliest steps in AD pathology in mildly symptomatic or even nonsymptomatic subjects, and are leading candidates for the detection of AD in its preclinical stages; (5) the improvement of clinical trial efficiency through the identification of subjects most likely to undergo imminent future clinical decline and the use of more sensitive outcome measures to reduce sample sizes. Baseline cognitive and/or MRI measures generally predicted future decline better than other modalities, whereas MRI measures of change were shown to be the most efficient outcome measures; (6) the confirmation of the AD risk loci CLU, CR1, and PICALM and the identification of novel candidate risk loci; (7) worldwide impact through the establishment of ADNI-like programs in Europe, Asia, and Australia; (8) understanding the biology and pathobiology of normal aging, MCI, and AD through integration of ADNI biomarker data with clinical data from ADNI to stimulate research that will resolve controversies about competing hypotheses on the etiopathogenesis of AD, thereby advancing efforts to find disease-modifying drugs for AD; and (9) the establishment of infrastructure to allow sharing of all raw and processed data without embargo to interested scientific investigators throughout the world. The ADNI study was extended by a 2-year Grand Opportunities grant in 2009 and a renewal of ADNI (ADNI-2) in October 2010 through to 2016, with enrollment of an additional 550 participants.

22048123|t|In vivo P2X7 inhibition reduces amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease through GSK3beta and secretases.
22048123|a|beta-Amyloid (Abeta) peptide production from amyloid precursor protein (APP) is essential in the formation of the beta-amyloid plaques characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. However, the extracellular signals that maintain the balance between nonpathogenic and pathologic forms of APP processing, mediated by alpha-secretase and beta-secretase respectively, remain poorly understood. In the present work, we describe regulation of the processing of APP via the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) receptor P2X7R. In 2 different cellular lines, the inhibition of either native or overexpressed P2X7R increased alpha-secretase activity through inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3). In vivo inhibition of the P2X7R in J20 mice, transgenic for mutant human APP, induced a significant decrease in the number of hippocampal amyloid plaques. This reduction correlated with a decrease in glycogen synthase kinase 3 activity in J20 mice, increasing the proteolytic processing of APP through an increase in alpha-secretase activity. The in vivo findings presented here demonstrate for the first time the therapeutic potential of P2X7R antagonism in the treatment of familiar Alzheimer's disease (FAD).

22048125|t|Abeta-induced formation of autophagosomes is mediated by RAGE-CaMKKbeta-AMPK signaling.
22048125|a|Pathological autophagic vacuoles (AVs) accumulate in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, but the mechanisms by which they are induced are unknown. In this study, we found that the formation of AVs was mediated by activation of adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the brains of APP/PS1 double transgenic mice, amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) pathology-bearing model mouse. Injection of sunitinib malate, AMPK inhibitor, to the mice lowered AV formation in their brains. Consistent with our in vivo observations, treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with Abeta enhanced the induction of autophagosomes, which was mediated by Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-beta (CaMKKbeta)-AMPK signaling, as shown using various inhibitors and small interfering RNA (siRNA). CaMKKbeta is a calcium-activated kinase, and the depletion of intracellular calcium by BAPTA-AM, a Ca(2+) chelator, also curtailed Abeta-induced autophagy. Finally, the inhibition of receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) attenuated autophagsome formation and AMPK signaling. Conversely, RAGE overexpression amplified the induction of autophagy. These results implicate the regulation of the Abeta-induced formation of AVs by the RAGE-calcium-CaMKKbeta-AMPK pathway and suggest that modulation of autophagosome formation and the interaction between Abeta and RAGE are beneficial in the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease.

22049418|t|Synaptic deficits are rescued in the p25/Cdk5 model of neurodegeneration by the reduction of beta-secretase (BACE1).
22049418|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, and is characterized by memory loss and cognitive decline, as well as amyloid beta (Abeta) accumulation, and progressive neurodegeneration. Cdk5 is a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase whose activation by the p25 protein has been implicated in a number of neurodegenerative disorders. The CK-p25 inducible mouse model exhibits progressive neuronal death, elevated Abeta, reduced synaptic plasticity, and impaired learning following p25 overexpression in forebrain neurons. Levels of Abeta, as well as the APP processing enzyme, beta-secretase (BACE1), are also increased in CK-p25 mice. It is unknown what role increased Abeta plays in the cognitive and neurodegenerative phenotype of the CK-p25 mouse. In the current work, we restored Abeta levels in the CK-p25 mouse to those of wild-type mice via the partial genetic deletion of BACE1, allowing us to examine the Abeta-independent phenotype of this mouse model. We show that, in the CK-p25 mouse, normalization of Abeta levels led to a rescue of synaptic and cognitive deficits. Conversely, neuronal loss was not ameliorated. Our findings indicate that increases in p25/Cdk5 activity may mediate cognitive and synaptic impairment via an Abeta-dependent pathway in the CK-p25 mouse. These findings explore the impact of targeting Abeta production in a mouse model of neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment, and how this may translate into therapeutic approaches for sporadic AD.

22049429|t|Dynamic analysis of amyloid beta-protein in behaving mice reveals opposing changes in ISF versus parenchymal Abeta during age-related plaque formation.
22049429|a|Growing evidence supports the hypothesis that soluble, diffusible forms of the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) are pathogenically important in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and thus have both diagnostic and therapeutic salience. To learn more about the dynamics of soluble Abeta economy in vivo, we used microdialysis to sample the brain interstitial fluid (ISF), which contains the most soluble Abeta species in brain at steady state, in >40 wake, behaving APP transgenic mice before and during the process of Abeta plaque formation (age 3-28 months). Diffusible forms of Abeta, especially Abeta(42), declined significantly in ISF as mice underwent progressive parenchymal deposition of Abeta. Moreover, radiolabeled Abeta administered at physiological concentrations into ISF revealed a striking difference in the fate of soluble Abeta in plaque-rich (vs plaque-free) mice: it clears more rapidly from the ISF and becomes more associated with the TBS-extractable pool, suggesting that cerebral amyloid deposits can rapidly sequester soluble Abeta from the ISF. Likewise, acute gamma-secretase inhibition in plaque-free mice showed a marked decline of Abeta(38), Abeta(40), and Abeta(42), whereas in plaque-rich mice, Abeta(42) declined significantly less. These results suggest that most of the Abeta(42) that populates the ISF in plaque-rich mice is derived not from new Abeta biosynthesis but rather from the large reservoir of less soluble Abeta(42) in brain parenchyma. Together, these and other findings herein illuminate the in vivo dynamics of soluble Abeta during the development of AD-type neuropathology and after gamma-secretase inhibition and help explain the apparent paradox that CSF Abeta(42) levels fall as humans develop AD.

22050953|t|Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids (HDLS): a misdiagnosed disease entity.
22050953|a|Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids (HDLS) was originally described in a large Swedish pedigree. Since then, 22 reports describing a total of 13 kindreds and 11 sporadic cases have been published. Inheritance is autosomal dominant, albeit the gene is unknown. Here we report on the clinical findings, genealogical data, brain MRI data, and autopsy/biopsy findings of four probands from three independently ascertained novel families from Norway, Germany and US. We identified a 39-year-old female and her twin sister, a 52-year-old male and a 47-year-old male with progressive neurological illness characterized by personality changes, cognitive decline and motor impairments, such as gait problems, bradykinesia, tremor and rigidity. Brain MRI showed white matter abnormalities with frontal prominence. Brain biopsy/autopsies were consistent with HDLS. HDLS is an under-recognized disease and in reporting these cases, we aim to increase the awareness of the disorder. Due to varied and wide phenotypic presentations, which may imitate several neurodegenerative diseases, HDLS can be difficult to diagnose. Definitive diagnosis can be established only by direct brain tissue examination. Familiarity with the clinical presentation and typical neuroimaging findings may be helpful in narrowing the diagnosis.

22051943|t|The effects of MyD88 deficiency on exploratory activity, anxiety, motor coordination, and spatial learning in C57BL/6 and APPswe/PS1dE9 mice.
22051943|a|Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of pattern-recognition receptors in innate immunity and provide a first line defense against pathogens and tissue injuries. In addition to important roles in infection, inflammation, and immune diseases, recent studies show that TLR signaling is involved in modulation of learning, memory, mood, and neurogenesis. Because MyD88 is essential for the downstream signaling of all TLRs, except TLR3, we investigated the effects of MyD88 deficiency (MyD88-/-) on behavioral functions in mice. Additionally, we recently demonstrated that a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) deficient for MyD88 had decreases in Abeta deposits and soluble Abeta in the brain as compared with MyD88 sufficient AD mouse models. Because accumulation of Abeta in the brain is postulated to be a causal event leading to cognitive deficits in AD, we investigated the effects of MyD88 deficiency on behavioral functions in the AD mouse model at 10 months of age. MyD88 deficient mice showed more anxiety in the elevated plus-maze. In the motor coordination tests, MyD88 deficient mice remained on a beam and a bar for a longer time, but with slower initial movement on the bar. In the Morris water maze test, MyD88 deficiency appeared to improve spatial learning irrespective of the transgene. Our findings suggest that the MyD88-dependent pathway contributes to behavioral functions in an AD mouse model and its control group.

22052825|t|Effect of introducing a short amyloidogenic sequence from the Abeta peptide at the N-terminus of 18-residue amphipathic helical peptides.
22052825|a|Fibril formation is the hallmark of pathogenesis in Alzheimer's disease and other amyloid disorders caused by conformational alterations leading to the aggregation of soluble monomers. Abeta40 self-associates to form amyloid fibrils. Its central seven-residue segment KLVFFAE (Abeta16-22), which is thought to be crucial for fibril formation of the full-length peptide, forms fibrils even in isolation. Context-dependent induction of amyloid formation by such sequences in peptides, which otherwise do not have that propensity, is of considerable interest. We have examined the effect of introducing the Abeta16-22 sequence at the N-terminus of two amphipathic helical 18-residue peptides Ac-WYSEMKRNVQRLERAIEE-am and Ac-KQLIRFLKRLDRNLWGLA-am, which have high average hydrophobic moment <muH> values but have net charges of 0 and +4, respectively, at neutral pH. Upon incubation in aqueous buffer, fibril-like aggregates were discernible by transmission electron microscopy for the peptide with only 0 net charge, which also displayed ThT binding and beta-structure. Although both the sequences have been derived from amphipathic helical segments in globular proteins and possess high average hydrophobic moments, the +4 charge peptide lacks the ability to form fibrils, while the peptide with 0 charge has the tendency to form fibrillar structures. Variation in the net charge and the presence of several glutamic acids in the sequence of the peptide with net charge 0 appear to favor the formation of fibrils when the Abeta16-22 sequence is attached at the N-terminus.

22055653|t|Clinical and neurobiological correlates of soluble amyloid precursor proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid.
22055653|a|BACKGROUND: According to a widely accepted hypothesis, the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is processed by two competing pathways: the amyloidogenic beta-secretase-mediated pathway or the nonamyloidogenic alpha-secretase-mediated pathway. APP is cleaved preferentially through the nonamyloidogenic pathway in normal brain, whereas the balance shifts to the amyloidogenic pathway in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The levels of the alpha-secretase-cleaved soluble APP (sAPPalpha) and beta-secretase-cleaved soluble APP (sAPPbeta) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are likely to reflect these competing mechanisms. METHODS: We investigated the levels and the relationship between sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta in the CSF of 64 patients with mild AD, 76 patients with mild cognitive impairment, and 12 cognitively healthy control subjects, as well as the effect of apolipoprotein E genotype and sex on soluble APP levels. RESULTS: There was a significant positive correlation between sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta levels in all three groups. sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta concentrations were higher in patients with mild cognitive impairment compared with patients with AD. In the AD group, females exhibited higher sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta levels than males. No influence of the apolipoprotein E genotype on soluble APP concentrations was detected. DISCUSSION: The positive correlation between sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta challenges the hypothesis that AD is caused by an imbalance of the alpha- and beta-secretase APP proteolysis through competing mechanisms. Moreover, the differences in CSF levels of sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta between male and female patients with AD may reflect a "sexual dimorphism" in the activity of the two APP processing pathways in AD.

22056484|t|Abeta plaque-associated glial reaction as a determinant of apoptotic neuronal death and cortical gliogenesis: a study in APP mutant mice.
22056484|a|The purpose of this study was to investigate the microglia-driven apoptosis and the Abeta deposits triggered generation of new microglial cells in the neocortex of TgCRND8 mice. Three- and seven-month-old TgCRND8 mice, displaying an early and widespread amyloid deposition, respectively, were used. In 7-month-old TgCRND8 mice the Abeta-associated glial reaction was accompanied by an intense immunoreactivity of both TNF-alpha and inducible nitric oxide synthase, increased immunoreactivity of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax and a decrease in levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2.Cortical and hippocampal neurons of TgCRND8 mice displayed higher immunoreactivity and higher nuclear expression of the transcription factor NF-kB than controls. It is possible that such an increase could represent a defence/compensatory response to degeneration. These findings indicate that Abeta deposits activate brain-resident microglia population and astrocytes, and induce overproduction of inflammatory mediators that enhance pro- and anti-apoptotic cascades. In both 3- and 7-month-old TgCRND8 mice apparent gliogenesis was present in the vicinity of Abeta plaques in the neocortex, indicating that microglia have a high proliferative rate which might play a more complex role than previously acknowledge.

22057511|a|Dietary factors may play a role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. In an effort to recapitulate some of the synaptic protein changes observed in the disease, AD transgenic and wild-type mice were fed either a normal or pro-oxidant diet for 3 months from three months of age. Pro-oxidant diet treatment resulted in altered expression of vesicular glutamate transporter-1 and glutamine synthetase, suggesting changes in glutamatergic synaptic function, and increased expression of urokinase plasminogen activator receptor, possibly reflecting oxidative stress.

22060133|t|alpha-Synuclein oligomers oppose long-term potentiation and impair memory through a calcineurin-dependent mechanism: relevance to human synucleopathic diseases.
22060133|a|Intracellular deposition of fibrillar aggregates of alpha-synuclein (alphaSyn) characterizes neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies. However, recent evidence indicates that small alphaSyn oligomeric aggregates that precede fibril formation may be the most neurotoxic species and can be found extracellularly. This new evidence has changed the view of pathological alphaSyn aggregation from a self-contained cellular phenomenon to an extracellular event and prompted investigation of the putative effects of extracellular alphaSyn oligomers. In this study, we report that extracellular application of alphaSyn oligomers detrimentally impacts neuronal welfare and memory function. We found that oligomeric alphaSyn increased intracellular Ca(2+) levels, induced calcineurin (CaN) activity, decreased cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) transcriptional activity and resulted in calcineurin-dependent death of human neuroblastoma cells. Similarly, CaN induction and CREB inhibition were observed when alphaSyn oligomers were applied to organotypic brain slices, which opposed hippocampal long-term potentiation. Furthermore, alphaSyn oligomers induced CaN, inhibited CREB and evoked memory impairments in mice that received acute intracerebroventricular injections. Notably, all these events were reversed by pharmacological inhibition of CaN. Moreover, we found decreased active CaN and reduced levels of phosphorylated CREB in autopsy brain tissue from patients affected by dementia with Lewy bodies, which is characterized by deposition of alphaSyn aggregates and progressive cognitive decline. These results indicate that exogenously applied alphaSyn oligomers impact neuronal function and produce memory deficits through mechanisms that involve CaN activation.

22063923|t|JD-30, an active fraction extracted from Danggui-Shaoyao-San, decreases beta-amyloid content and deposition, improves LTP reduction and prevents spatial cognition impairment in SAMP8 mice.
22063923|a|JD-30 is an active fraction extracted from Danggui-Shaoyao-San (DSS), a traditional Chinese medicinal prescription. We previously showed that JD-30 could alleviate cognitive dysfunction of the mice induced by intracerebroventricular injection of beta-amyloid (Abeta). However, data remain scarce on the effect of JD-30 on an Alzheimer's disease (AD) model and the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Further detailed studies on the effects of JD-30 on spatial cognition of senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8), a suitable rodent model for cognitive impairment of aged subjects were investigated to elucidate the possible mechanisms. Long-term treatment with JD-30 significantly decreased the prolonged latency of SAMP8 in the Morris water-maze test. It also ameliorated the reduction of long-term potentiation (LTP) and reduced the damage of neurons in the hippocampus of SAMP8. Finally, JD-30 decreased the content and deposition of Abeta in the brain of SAMP8. The results show that JD-30 improves deterioration of spatial learning and memory in the SAMP8 mouse model, and by decreasing the content and deposition of Abeta, neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity improve, suggesting one of the mechanisms involved.

22064374|t|S-Adenosylhomocysteine enhances DNA damage through increased beta-amyloid formation and inhibition of the DNA-repair enzyme OGG1b in microglial BV-2 cells.
22064374|a|S-Adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) is a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, for which beta-Amyliod (Abeta) formation is a major risk factor. We recently showed that SAH increases Abeta formation in mouse microglial BV2 cells. Here, we show that incubation of BV2 cells with SAH (0-500nM) for 6-24h sequentially increased Abeta formation, ROS and DNA damage measured as 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) levels. Pre-incubation of BV2 cells with 20muM beta-secretase inhibitor IV for 30min followed by incubation with SAH (500nM) markedly decreased Abeta formation and 8-oxo-dG levels. Treatment with SAH for 24h concentration-dependently inhibited DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1) activity and inhibited DNMT1 binding to Sp1 site of 8-oxoG-DNA glycosylases I (OGG1) promoter and OGG1 protein and mRNA expression at 24h; the latter effect was attributed to hypomethylation of the OGG1 gene promoter, because pre-incubation of cells with betaine (1.0mM for 30 min) markedly prevented the inhibition of OGG1 protein expression induced by SAH. Overall, we demonstrate that SAH increases DNA damage in BV-2 cells possible by increased Abeta formation leading to increased formation of ROS. Furthermore, the DNA damage is enhanced by SAH through inhibition of DNMT1 activity and hypomethylation of OGG1 gene promoter.

22064478|t|Regulation of estrogen receptor alpha N-terminus conformation and function by peptidyl prolyl isomerase Pin1.
22064478|a|Estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), a key driver of growth in the majority of breast cancers, contains an unstructured transactivation domain (AF1) in its N terminus that is a convergence point for growth factor and hormonal activation. This domain is controlled by phosphorylation, but how phosphorylation impacts AF1 structure and function is unclear. We found that serine 118 (S118) phosphorylation of the ERalpha AF1 region in response to estrogen (agonist), tamoxifen (antagonist), and growth factors results in recruitment of the peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase Pin1. Phosphorylation of S118 is critical for Pin1 binding, and mutation of S118 to alanine prevents this association. Importantly, Pin1 isomerizes the serine118-proline119 bond from a cis to trans isomer, with a concomitant increase in AF1 transcriptional activity. Pin1 overexpression promotes ligand-independent and tamoxifen-inducible activity of ERalpha and growth of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells. Pin1 expression correlates with proliferation in ERalpha-positive rat mammary tumors. These results establish phosphorylation-coupled proline isomerization as a mechanism modulating AF1 functional activity and provide insight into the role of a conformational switch in the functional regulation of the intrinsically disordered transactivation domain of ERalpha.

22065785|t|Nanoparticles enhance brain delivery of blood-brain barrier-impermeable probes for in vivo optical and magnetic resonance imaging.
22065785|a|Several imaging modalities are suitable for in vivo molecular neuroimaging, but the blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits their utility by preventing brain delivery of most targeted molecular probes. We prepared biodegradable nanocarrier systems made up of poly(n-butyl cyanoacrylate) dextran polymers coated with polysorbate 80 (PBCA nanoparticles) to deliver BBB-impermeable molecular imaging probes into the brain for targeted molecular neuroimaging. We demonstrate that PBCA nanoparticles allow in vivo targeting of BBB-impermeable contrast agents and staining reagents for electron microscopy, optical imaging (multiphoton), and whole brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), facilitating molecular studies ranging from individual synapses to the entire brain. PBCA nanoparticles can deliver BBB-impermeable targeted fluorophores of a wide range of sizes: from 500-Da targeted polar molecules to 150,000-Da tagged immunoglobulins into the brain of living mice. The utility of this approach is demonstrated by (i) development of a "Nissl stain" contrast agent for cellular imaging, (ii) visualization of amyloid plaques in vivo in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease using (traditionally) non-BBB-permeable reagents that detect plaques, and (iii) delivery of gadolinium-based contrast agents into the brain of mice for in vivo whole brain MRI. Four-dimensional real-time two-photon and MR imaging reveal that brain penetration of PBCA nanoparticles occurs rapidly with a time constant of ~18 min. PBCA nanoparticles do not induce nonspecific BBB disruption, but collaborate with plasma apolipoprotein E to facilitate BBB crossing. Collectively, these findings highlight the potential of using biodegradable nanocarrier systems to deliver BBB-impermeable targeted molecular probes into the brain for diagnostic neuroimaging.

22067061|t|Coordinated increase of gamma-secretase reaction products in the plasma of some female Japanese sporadic Alzheimer's disease patients: quantitative analysis of p3-Alcalpha with a new ELISA system.
22067061|a|BACKGROUND: Aggregatable amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) and non-aggregatable p3-Alcalpha are metabolic products of the gamma-secretase cleavage of amyloid beta-protein precursor (APP) and Alcadeinalpha (Alcalpha), respectively. Familial AD (FAD) -linked mutations in the presenilin 1 or 2 (PS1 or PS2) component of gamma-secretase can cause alternative intramembranous processing of APP and Alcalpha, leading to a coordinated generation of variants of both Abeta and p3-Alcalpha. Variant Alcalpha peptides have been observed in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with mild cognitive impairment and sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since, like APP, Alcalpha is largely expressed in brain, one might predict that alternative processing of Alcalpha would be reflected in body fluids of some AD patients. These patients with misprocessing of multiple gamma-secretase substrates might define an endophenotype of p3-Alcalpha, in whom AD is due either to dysfunction of gamma-secretase or to a disorder of the clearance of hydrophobic peptides such as those derived from transmembrane domains. RESULTS: We developed a simple procedure for extraction of p3-Alcalpha from plasma and for analyzing this extract in a sensitive, p3-Alcalpha-specific sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system. Plasma p3-Alcalpha levels and Abeta40 levels were examined in sporadic AD subjects from two independent Japanese cohorts. In some of these patients, levels of plasma p3-Alcalpha were significantly higher, and were accompanied by parallel changes in Abeta40 levels. This AD-related difference was more marked in female subjects, but this phenomenon was not observed in subjects with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). CONCLUSION: Reagents and procedures have been established that enable extraction of p3-Alcalpha from plasma and for quantification of plasma p3-Alcalpha levels by ELISA. Some populations of AD subjects apparently show increased levels of both p3-Alcalpha and Abeta40. Quantification of p3-Alcalpha level may be useful as a readily accessible biomarker for a population of sporadic AD patients in which disease pathogenesis is associated with either dysfunction of gamma-secretase or with a disorder of the clearance of transmembrane domain-derived peptides.

22067167|t|Carbon nanotube inhibits the formation of beta-sheet-rich oligomers of the Alzheimer's amyloid-beta(16-22) peptide.
22067167|a|Alzheimer's disease is associated with the abnormal self-assembly of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide into toxic beta-rich aggregates. Experimental studies have shown that hydrophobic nanoparticles retard Abeta fibrillation by slowing down the nucleation process; however, the effects of nanoparticles on Abeta oligomeric structures remain elusive. In this study, we investigate the conformations of Abeta(16-22) octamers in the absence and presence of a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) by performing extensive all-atom replica exchange molecular-dynamics simulations in explicit solvent. Our simulations starting from eight random chains demonstrate that the addition of SWCNT into Abeta(16-22) solution prevents beta-sheet formation. Simulation starting from a prefibrillar beta-sheet octamer shows that SWCNT destabilizes the beta-sheet structure. A detailed analysis of the Abeta(16-22)/SWCNT/water interactions reveals that both the inhibition of beta-sheet formation and the destabilization of prefibrillar beta-sheets by SWCNT result from the same physical forces: hydrophobic and pi-stacking interactions (with the latter playing a more important role). By analyzing the stacking patterns between the Phe aromatic rings and the SWCNT carbon rings, we find that short ring-centroid distances mostly favor parallel orientation, whereas large distances allow all other orientations to be populated. Overall, our computational study provides evidence that SWCNT is likely to inhibit Abeta(16-22) and full-length Abeta fibrillation.

22067910|t|Cognitive decline typical of frontotemporal lobar degeneration in transgenic mice expressing the 25-kDa C-terminal fragment of TDP-43.
22067910|a|Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is the pathological signature protein in several neurodegenerative disorders, including the majority of frontotemporal lobar degeneration cases (FTLD-TDP), motor neuron disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Pathological TDP-43 is mislocalized from its nuclear location to the cytoplasm, where it accumulates and is proteolytically cleaved to form C-terminal fragments. Although the 25-kDa C-terminal fragment of TDP-43 (TDP-25) accumulates in affected brain regions, its role in the disease pathogenesis remains elusive. To address this problem, we have generated a novel transgenic mouse that selectively expresses TDP-25 in neurons. We show that transgenic mice expressing TDP-25 develop cognitive deficits associated with the build-up of soluble TDP-25. These cognitive deficits are independent of TDP-43-positive inclusions and occur without overt neurodegeneration. Additionally, we show that the expression of TDP-25 is sufficient to alter the processing of endogenous full-length TDP-43. These studies represent the first in vivo demonstration of a pathological role for TDP-25 and strongly suggest that the onset of cognitive deficits in TDP-43 proteinopathies is independent of TDP-43 inclusions. These data provide a framework for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the onset of cognitive deficits in FTLD-TDP and other TDP-43 proteinopathies; thus, the TDP-25 transgenic mice represent a unique tool to reach this goal.

22070199|t|Amyloid peptide regulates calcium homoeostasis and arrhythmogenesis in pulmonary vein cardiomyocytes.
22070199|a|BACKGROUND: Amyloid peptides modulate cardiac calcium homoeostasis and play an important role in the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation. Pulmonary veins (PVs) are critical in the genesis of atrial fibrillation and contain abundant amyloid peptides. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate whether amyloid peptides may change the PV electrical activity through regulating calcium homoeostasis. METHODS AND RESULTS: The channel and calcium-handling protein expressions, intracellular calcium and ionic currents were studied in isolated rabbit PV cardiomyocytes in the presence and absence (control) of beta-amyloid (Abeta(25-35) ) for 4-6 h, using Western blot analysis, indo-1 fluorimetric ratio and whole-cell patch clamp techniques. Abeta(25-35) decreased the expressions of Ca(V) 1.2, total or Ser16-phosphorylated phospholamban (p-PLB), p-PLB/PLB ratio, sodium/calcium exchanger, but did not change ryanodine receptor, sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) ATPase and K(+) channel proteins (Kir2.1, Kir2.3, Kv1.4, Kv1.5 and Kv4.2). Abeta(25-35) -treated cardiomyocytes had smaller calcium transient, SR calcium store, L-type calcium current and sodium/calcium exchanger current than control cardiomyocytes. Moreover, Abeta(25-35) -treated cardiomyocytes (n = 20) had shorter 90% of the action potential duration (82 +- 3 vs. 93 +- 5 ms, P < 0 05) than control cardiomyocytes (n = 16). CONCLUSION: Abeta(25-35) has direct electrophysiological effects on PV cardiomyocytes.

22070531|t|Amelioration of amyloid beta-induced cognitive deficits by Zataria multiflora Boiss. essential oil in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease.
22070531|a|INTRODUCTION: The limitations of current Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapeutics have prompted investigation into innovative therapeutics focused on antiinflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective agents including those from medicinal plants. Numerous plants have been tested for their potential for alleviating symptoms of AD. AIMS: Zataria multiflora Boiss. (ZM) a member of Lamiaceae family has been used in Iranian traditional medicine for its beneficial effects on mental abilities. Therefore, the effect of its essential oil was evaluated in a rat model of AD. METHODS: Amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) fragment 25-35 was injected bilaterally in the CA1 region of rats hippocampus and the effect of different doses of ZM essential oil (50, 100, or 200 muL/kg) on cognitive function was investigated in the Morris water maze. Acute toxicity of the essential oil was also studied. RESULTS: The results showed increases in escape latency, traveled distance, heading angle, and decreases in target quadrant entries in Abeta-received groups as compared to the control group. This impairment was reversed by ZM essential oil. The results of acute toxicity testing revealed that the calculated LD50 (1264.9 muL/kg) is much higher than the therapeutic dose (100 muL/kg). CONCLUSIONS: It seems that antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and anticholinesterase activities of ZM or its main constituents might contribute to its beneficial effects in this model. Our findings suggest that ZM may be a potentially valuable source of natural therapeutic agents for the treatment of AD. However, further investigations are necessary to establish its clinical efficacy and potential toxicity, before any recommendations concerning its use as a medication in the treatment of AD.

Modification in decoration and chiral separation resulted in the 40 nM inhibitor, (-)-37, which showed in vivo reduction of amyloid beta peptides. The crystal structure of 18a showed a binding mode driven by interaction with the catalytic aspartate dyad and distribution of the biaryl amide decoration towards S1 and S3 pockets.

22071505|t|Toxic effects of amyloid fibrils on cell membranes: the importance of ganglioside GM1.
22071505|a|The interaction of amyloid aggregates with the cell plasma membrane is currently considered among the basic mechanisms of neuronal dysfunction in amyloid neurodegeneration. We used amyloid oligomers and fibrils grown from the yeast prion Sup35p, responsible for the specific prion trait [PSI(+)], to investigate how membrane lipids modulate fibril interaction with the membranes of cultured H-END cells and cytotoxicity. Sup35p shares no homology with endogenous mammalian polypeptide chains. Thus, the generic toxicity of amyloids and the molecular events underlying cell degeneration can be investigated without interference with analogous polypeptides encoded by the cell genome. Sup35 fibrils bound to the cell membrane without increasing its permeability to Ca(2+). Fibril binding resulted in structural reorganization and aggregation of membrane rafts, with GM1 clustering and alteration of its mobility. Sup35 fibril binding was affected by GM1 or its sialic acid moiety, but not by cholesterol membrane content, with complete inhibition after treatment with fumonisin B1 or neuraminidase. Finally, cell impairment resulted from caspase-8 activation after Fas receptor translocation on fibril binding to the plasma membrane. Our observations suggest that amyloid fibrils induce abnormal accumulation and overstabilization of raft domains in the cell membrane and provide a reasonable, although not unique, mechanistic and molecular explanation for fibril toxicity.

22072713|t|SOD1 (copper/zinc superoxide dismutase) deficiency drives amyloid beta protein oligomerization and memory loss in mouse model of Alzheimer disease.
22072713|a|Oxidative stress is closely linked to the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration. Soluble amyloid beta (Abeta) oligomers cause cognitive impairment and synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer disease (AD). However, the relationship between oligomers, oxidative stress, and their localization during disease progression is uncertain. Our previous study demonstrated that mice deficient in cytoplasmic copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD, SOD1) have features of drusen formation, a hallmark of age-related macular degeneration (Imamura, Y., Noda, S., Hashizume, K., Shinoda, K., Yamaguchi, M., Uchiyama, S., Shimizu, T., Mizushima, Y., Shirasawa, T., and Tsubota, K. (2006) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 103, 11282-11287). Amyloid assembly has been implicated as a common mechanism of plaque and drusen formation. Here, we show that Sod1 deficiency in an amyloid precursor protein-overexpressing mouse model (AD mouse, Tg2576) accelerated Abeta oligomerization and memory impairment as compared with control AD mouse and that these phenomena were basically mediated by oxidative damage. The increased plaque and neuronal inflammation were accompanied by the generation of N(epsilon)-carboxymethyl lysine in advanced glycation end products, a rapid marker of oxidative damage, induced by Sod1 gene-dependent reduction. The Sod1 deletion also caused Tau phosphorylation and the lower levels of synaptophysin. Furthermore, the levels of SOD1 were significantly decreased in human AD patients rather than non-AD age-matched individuals, but mitochondrial SOD (Mn-SOD, SOD2) and extracellular SOD (CuZn-SOD, SOD3) were not. These findings suggest that cytoplasmic superoxide radical plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD. Activation of Sod1 may be a therapeutic strategy for the inhibition of AD progression.

22074918|t|Comparison of presenilin 1 and presenilin 2 gamma-secretase activities using a yeast reconstitution system.
22074918|a|gamma-Secretase is composed of at least four proteins, presenilin (PS), nicastrin (NCT), Aph1, and Pen2. PS is the catalytic subunit of the gamma-secretase complex, having aspartic protease activity. PS has two homologs, namely, PS1 and PS2. To compare the activity of these complexes containing different PSs, we reconstituted them in yeast, which lacks gamma-secretase homologs. Yeast cells were transformed with PS1 or PS2, NCT, Pen2, Aph1, and artificial substrate C55-Gal4p. After substrate cleavage, Gal4p translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription of the reporter genes ADE2, HIS3, and lacZ. gamma-Secretase activity was measured based on yeast growth on selective media and beta-galactosidase activity. PS1 gamma-secretase was ~24-fold more active than PS2 gamma-secretase in the beta-galactosidase assay. Using yeast microsomes containing gamma-secretase and C55, we compared the concentration of Abeta generated by PS1 or PS2 gamma-secretase. PS1 gamma-secretase produced ~24-fold more Abeta than PS2 gamma-secretase. We found the optimal pH of Abeta production by PS2 to be 7.0, as for PS1, and that the PS2 complex included immature NCT, unlike the PS1 complex, which included mature NCT. In this study, we compared the activity of PS1 or PS2 per one gamma-secretase complex. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments using yeast microsomes showed that PS1 concentrations in the gamma-secretase complex were ~28 times higher than that of PS2. Our data suggest that the PS1 complex is only marginally less active than the PS2 complex in Abeta production.

22076255|t|CSF levels of oligomeric alpha-synuclein and beta-amyloid as biomarkers for neurodegenerative disease.
22076255|a|Protein misfolding and aggregation is a critically important feature in many devastating neurodegenerative diseases, therefore characterization of the CSF concentration profiles of selected key forms and morphologies of proteins involved in these diseases, including beta-amyloid (Abeta) and alpha-synuclein (a-syn), can be an effective diagnostic assay for these diseases. CSF levels of tau and Abeta have been shown to have great promise as biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease. However since the onset and progression of many neurodegenerative diseases have been strongly correlated with the presence of soluble oligomeric aggregates of proteins including various Abeta and a-syn aggregate species, specific detection and quantification of levels of each of these different toxic protein species in CSF may provide a simple and accurate means to presymptomatically diagnose and distinguish between these diseases. Here we show that the presence of different protein morphologies in human CSF samples can be readily detected using highly selective morphology specific reagents in conjunction with a sensitive electronic biosensor. We further show that these morphology specific reagents can readily distinguish between post-mortem CSF samples from AD, PD and cognitively normal sources. These studies suggest that detection of specific oligomeric aggregate species holds great promise as sensitive biomarkers for neurodegenerative disease.

22076403|t|Functional consequences of the lack of amyloid precursor protein in the mouse dentate gyrus in vivo.
22076403|a|The amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we studied whether the lack of APP affects the synaptic properties in the dentate gyrus by measuring granule cell field potentials evoked by perforant path stimulation in anesthetized 9-11-month-old APP-deficient mice in vivo. We found decreased paired-pulse facilitation, indicating altered presynaptic short-term plasticity in the APP-deficient dentate gyrus. In contrast, excitatory synaptic strength and granule cell firing were unchanged in APP knockout mice. Likewise, long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by a theta-burst stimulation protocol was not impaired in the absence of APP. These findings suggest that the deletion of APP may affect presynaptic plasticity of synaptic transmission at the perforant path-granule cell synapse but leaves synaptic efficacy intact and LTP preserved, possibly due to functional redundancy within the APP gene family.

22079317|t|Genistein inhibits aggregation of exogenous amyloid-beta1-40 and alleviates astrogliosis in the hippocampus of rats.
22079317|a|We addressed the question of whether injection of Amyloid beta (Abeta)(1-40) in the rat brain is associated with pathology in the hippocampus, and if genistein has any protective effect against the neuronal damage caused by Abeta(1-40). Genistein is a plant-derived compound with a structure similar to that of the female sex hormone estrogen and it was recently shown that pretreatment with a single dose of genistein ameliorated learning and memory deficits in an (Abeta)(1-40) rat model of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we report that injection of the amyloid peptide into the hippocampus of rats led to formation of Abeta(1-40) positive aggregates close to the lateral blade of the dentate gyrus (DGlb). We also observed the following in the hippocampus: extensive cell death in the DGlb (P<0.0001), CA1 (P=0.03), and CA3 (P=0.002); an increased number of iNOS-expressing cells (P=0.01) and gliosis. Genistein given to rats by gavage 1h before injection of Abeta(1-40) inhibited the formation of Abeta(1-40) positive aggregates in the brain tissue and led to increased number of nNOS(+) (P=0.0001) cells in the hippocampus compared to sham-operated genistein-treated controls. Treatment with genistein also alleviated the extensive astrogliosis that occurred in Abeta(1-40)-injected hippocampus to a level similar to that observed in sham-operated rats. We conclude that the neurons in the DGlb are most sensitive to Abeta(1-40), and a single dose of genistein can ameliorate Abeta(1-40) induced pathology.

22080049|t|Elevated labile Cu is associated with oxidative pathology in Alzheimer disease.
22080049|a|Oxidative stress is implicated in Alzheimer disease (AD) pathogenesis, for which evidence indicates that radical species are generated by the redox-active biometal Cu. The contribution of labile Cu to the oxidative stress observed in AD has not been evaluated. The Cu content of postmortem cortical tissue from nondemented elderly controls and AD cases was measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy, and the proportion of labile Cu was assessed using the Cu-phenanthroline assay. Further, the capacity of the tissue to stabilize Cu(2+) was evaluated using immobilized metal-affinity chromatography, and the level of tissue oxidative damage was determined by the presence of thiobarbituric acid-reactive compounds. We identified elevated levels of exchangeable Cu(2+), which were correlated with tissue oxidative damage; additionally, we noted an increased capacity of AD cortical tissue samples to bind Cu(2+). This deranged Cu homeostasis reflects the homeostatic breakdown of Cu observed in AD and supports biometal metabolism as a therapeutic target.

22080177|t|Intra- and inter-cortical motor excitability in Alzheimer's disease.
22080177|a|Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) provides evidence for facilitatory and inhibitory motor dysfunctions in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The corpus callosum (CC) is affected in AD already at early stages consistent with the hypothesis that AD patients exhibit alterations in transcallosally mediated motor inhibition (ipsilateral silent period, iSP). Therefore, here we aimed at investigating the integrity not only of intra-, but also of inter-hemispheric mechanisms of cortical motor excitability in AD. We determined the iSP, the resting motor threshold (RMT), and the amplitude of motor evoked potentials (MEP) in 19 AD patients and 19 healthy controls using single-pulse TMS. Furthermore, we used paired-pulse TMS to study the intra-cortical inhibition (ICI) and intra-cortical facilitation (ICF). All subjects underwent comprehensive neuropsychologic, clinical, and laboratory testing, and neuroimaging to exclude significant co-morbidity. In AD patients, the RMT was significantly reduced (Oneway-ANOVA). An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) revealed a strong group specific interaction of the inhibitory interstimulus intervals (p = 0.005) with a reduced ICI in AD. Furthermore, we found a significantly prolonged iSP-latency (p = 0.003) in AD compared to controls, whereas the iSP-duration was not different. The iSP-latency correlated significantly with the ICI (ANCOVA) (p = 0.02). The ICF did not differ significantly between groups. Our data suggest comprehensive but still subclinical dysfunctions of motor cortical inhibition in mild to moderate clinical stages of AD with strong interactions of intra- and inter-hemispheric inhibitory phenomena. Future studies are needed to show the potential prognostic relevance of these findings for the further course of the disease.

22081976|t|Antimicrobial properties of amyloid peptides.
22081976|a|More than two dozen clinical syndromes known as amyloid diseases are characterized by the buildup of extended insoluble fibrillar deposits in tissues. These amorphous Congo red staining deposits known as amyloids exhibit a characteristic green birefringence and cross-beta structure. Substantial evidence implicates oligomeric intermediates of amyloids as toxic species in the pathogenesis of these chronic disease states. A growing body of data has suggested that these toxic species form ion channels in cellular membranes causing disruption of calcium homeostasis, membrane depolarization, energy drainage, and in some cases apoptosis. Amyloid peptide channels exhibit a number of common biological properties including the universal U-shape beta-strand-turn-beta-strand structure, irreversible and spontaneous insertion into membranes, production of large heterogeneous single-channel conductances, relatively poor ion selectivity, inhibition by Congo red, and channel blockade by zinc. Recent evidence has suggested that increased amounts of amyloids not only are toxic to its host target cells but also possess antimicrobial activity. Furthermore, at least one human antimicrobial peptide, protegrin-1, which kills microbes by a channel-forming mechanism, has been shown to possess the ability to form extended amyloid fibrils very similar to those of classic disease-forming amyloids. In this paper, we will review the reported antimicrobial properties of amyloids and the implications of these discoveries for our understanding of amyloid structure and function.

22083646|t|Interference of low-molecular substances with the thioflavin-T fluorescence assay of amyloid fibrils.
22083646|a|Abnormal fibrillization of amyloidogenic peptides/proteins has been linked to various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease as well as with type-II diabetes mellitus. The kinetics of protein fibrillization is commonly studied by using a fluorescent dye Thioflavin T (ThT) that binds to protein fibrils and exerts increased fluorescence intensity in bound state. Recently, it has been demonstrated that several low-molecular weight compounds like Basic Blue 41, Basic Blue 12, Azure C, and Tannic acid interfere with the fluorescence of ThT bound to Alzheimers' amyloid-beta fibrils and cause false positive results during the screening of fibrillization inhibitors. In the current study, we demonstrated that the same selected substances also decrease the fluorescence signal of ThT bound to insulin fibrils already at submicromolar or micromolar concentrations. Kinetic experiments show that unlike to true inhibitors, these compounds did neither decrease the fibrillization rate nor increase the lag-period. Absence of soluble insulin in the end of the experiment confirmed that these compounds do not disaggregate the insulin fibrils and, thus, are not fibrillization inhibitors at concentrations studied. Our results show that interference with ThT test is a general phenomenon and more attention has to be paid to interpretation of kinetic results of protein fibrillization obtained by using fluorescent dyes.

22085646|t|Structural features of the KPI domain control APP dimerization, trafficking, and processing.
22085646|a|The two major isoforms of human APP, APP695 and APP751, differ by the presence of a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor (KPI) domain in the extracellular region. APP processing and function is thought to be regulated by homodimerization. We used bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) to study dimerization of different APP isoforms and mutants. APP751 was found to form significantly more homodimers than APP695. Mutation of dimerization motifs in the TM domain did not affect fluorescence complementation, but native folding of KPI is critical for APP751 homodimerization. APP751 and APP695 dimers were mostly localized at steady state in the Golgi region, suggesting that most of the APP751 and 695 dimers are in the secretory pathway. Mutation of the KPI led to the retention of the APP homodimers in the endoplasmic reticulum. We finally showed that APP751 is more efficiently processed through the nonamyloidogenic pathway than APP695. These findings provide new insight on the particular role of KPI domain in APP dimerization. The correlation observed between dimerization, subcellular localization, and processing suggests that dimerization acts as an efficient regulator of APP trafficking in the secretory compartments that has major consequences on its processing.

22085694|t|Impaired long-trace eyeblink conditioning in a Tg2576 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
22085694|a|Eyeblink conditioning has been used for assessing cognitive performance in cases of human neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we tested and compared the delay and long-trace interval (TI=500ms) eyeblink conditionings in a Tg2576 mouse model of AD, at the age of 3, 6, and 12 months. Tg2576 mice exhibited significant impairment in trace conditioning at 6 months of age. In contrast, delay conditioning was not impaired in Tg2576 mice even at 12 months. These findings indicate that the long-TI eyeblink conditioning is more susceptible to age-related cognitive deterioration than delay conditioning in Tg2576 mice. The long-trace eyeblink conditioning could be a potential tool for detecting early cognitive deficits in AD mouse model.

22086493|t|Roles of amyloid precursor protein family members in neuroprotection, stress signaling and aging.
22086493|a|The roles of amyloid precursor protein (APP) family members in normal brain function are poorly understood. Under physiological conditions the majority of APP appears to be processed along the non-amyloidogenic pathway leading to the formation of the secreted N-terminal APP fragment sAPPalpha. This cleavage product of APP has been implicated in several physiological processes such as neuroprotection, synaptic plasticity, neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis. In this review we focus on the role of APP family members in neuroprotection and summarize the cellular and molecular mechanisms which are believed to mediate this effect. We propose that a reduction of APP processing along the non-amyloidogenic pathway during brain aging could result in an enhanced susceptibility of neurons to cellular stress and could contribute to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease.

22086824|t|Cell-line specific protection by berry polyphenols against hydrogen peroxide challenge and lack of effect on metabolism of amyloid precursor protein.
22086824|a|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) altered metabolism, Abeta-overproduction/aggregation and oxidative stress are implicated in the development of Alzheimer's disease pathology. Based on our previous data indicating that administration of a polyphenol-rich (PrB) blueberry extract (from wild Vaccinium angustifolium) is memory enhancing in healthy mice and in order to delineate the neuroprotective mechanisms, this study investigated the antioxidant effects of PrB in H2O2-induced oxidative damage, Abeta peptide fibrillogenesis and APP metabolism. PrB suppressed H2O2-initiated oxidation (DCF assay) and cell death (MTT assay) in SH-SY5Y cells. Protective effects were observed on Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells overexpressing APP770 carrying the mutation Val717Phe only at high concentrations, while further damage on HEK293 cells was induced after co-treatment with 250 microM H2O2 and PrB in comparison with H2O2 alone. Using the thioflavine T assay, blueberry polyphenols inhibited Abeta-aggregation (~70%, 15 microg/mL) in a time-dependent manner, while in the CHO(APP770) cells it had no effect on APP metabolism as assessed by western blot. The results suggest that blueberry polyphenols exhibit antioxidant and/or pro-oxidant properties according to the cellular environment and have no effect on APP metabolism.

22086926|t|Down-regulation of the ATP-binding cassette transporter 2 (Abca2) reduces amyloid-beta production by altering Nicastrin maturation and intracellular localization.
22086926|a|Clinical, pharmacological, biochemical, and genetic evidence support the notion that alteration of cholesterol homeostasis strongly predisposes to Alzheimer disease (AD). The ATP-binding cassette transporter-2 (Abca2), which plays a role in intracellular sterol trafficking, has been genetically linked to AD. It is unclear how these two processes are related. Here we demonstrate that down-regulation of Abca2 in mammalian cells leads to decreased amyloid-beta (Abeta) generation. In vitro studies revealed altered gamma-secretase complex formation in Abca2 knock-out cells due to the altered levels, post-translational modification, and subcellular localization of Nicastrin. Reduced Abca2 levels in mammalian cells in vitro, in Drosophila melanogaster and in mice resulted in altered gamma-secretase processing of APP, and thus Abeta generation, without affecting Notch cleavage.

22087836|t|Interacting with gamma-secretase for treating Alzheimer's disease: from inhibition to modulation.
22087836|a|Drugs currently used for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) produce limited clinical benefits, and there is no disease-modifying therapy yet available. Compounds that inhibit or modulate gamma-secretase, the pivotal enzyme that generates beta-amyloid (Abeta), are potential therapeutics for AD. This article briefly reviews the profile of gamma-secretase inhibitors and modulators that have reached the clinic. Studies in both transgenic and non-transgenic animal models of AD have indicated that gamma-secretase inhibitors, administered by the oral route, are able to lower brain Abeta concentrations. However, scanty data are available on the effects of these compounds on brain Abeta deposition after prolonged administration. gamma-Secretase inhibitors may cause abnormalities in the gastrointestinal tract, thymus, spleen, skin, and decrease in lymphocytes and alterations in hair color in experimental animals and in man, effects believed to be associated with the inhibition of the cleavage of Notch, a transmembrane receptor involved in regulating cell-fate decisions. Unfortunately, two large Phase III clinical trials of semagacestat in mild-to-moderate AD patients were prematurely interrupted because of the observation of a detrimental cognitive and functional effect of the drug. These detrimental effects were mainly ascribed to the inhibition of the processing of an unknown substrate of gamma-secretase. It has been also hypothesized that the detrimental cognitive effects observed after semagacestat administration are due to the accumulation of the neurotoxic precursor of Abeta (the carboxy-terminal fragment of amyloid precursor protein, APP, or CTFbeta) resulting from the block of the gamma-secretase cleavage activity on APP. Some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and other small organic molecules have been found to modulate gamma-secretase shifting its cleavage activity from longer to shorter Abeta species without affecting Notch cleavage. However, two large Phase III studies in mild AD patients with tarenflurbil, a putative gamma-secretase modulator, were also completely negative. The failure of tarenflurbil was ascribed to low potency and brain penetration. New more selective gamma-secretase inhibitors and more potent, more brain penetrant gamma-secretase modulators are being developed with the hope of overcoming the previous setbacks. Further understanding of the reasons of the failures of these gamma-secretase-based drugs in AD may be important for the future research on effective treatments for this devastating disease.

22089933|t|Interactions of amyloid beta peptide 1-40 and cerebrosterol.
22089933|a|Amyloid beta peptides appear to play a role in physiological processes; however, they are also involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. Their actions under normal conditions are probably mediated by soluble monomeric L-isoforms at low concentrations, perhaps via highly specific interactions. On the contrary, toxic effects of aggregated natural L-isoforms/synthetic D-isoforms on membranes are very similar, but synthetic reverse/random L: -isoforms without pronounced aggregation properties are not toxic. Our previous work reported interactions of non-aggregated/aggregated L-isoforms of amyloid beta peptides 1-40/1-42 with racemic 24-hydroxycholesterol. In this study, stereospecificity in the interactions of natural 24(S)hydroxycholesterol (cerebrosterol) or synthetic 24(R)hydroxycholesterol with soluble fragment 1-40 was evaluated by means of an in vitro test based on increased vulnerability of the hemicholinium-3 sensitive high-affinity choline uptake system in rat hippocampal cholesterol-depleted synaptosomes to the actions of amyloid beta; computational simulations were also performed. Our results suggest that: (1) 24(S)hydroxycholesterol interacts with L-peptide 1-40 but not with the reverse L-peptide 40-1, (2) 24(R)hydroxycholesterol does not interact with L-peptide 1-40 or reverse 40-1, and (3) both enantiomers can probably interact with D-peptide 1-40. Therefore, the binding of 24(S)hydroxycholesterol is not fully stereospecific and the interaction could not reflect a physiological mechanism. Data from the computational simulation indicate that the hydrophobic core of the amyloid beta molecule interacts with the hydrophobic part of 24(S)hydroxycholesterol, but no hydrogen bonds with high stability were found. Using this procedure, globular amyloid beta could retain 24(S)hydroxycholesterol and thus contribute to its pathological accumulation in the brains of patients with Alzheimer disease.

22090477|t|Robust central reduction of amyloid-beta in humans with an orally available, non-peptidic beta-secretase inhibitor.
22090477|a|According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, cerebral deposition of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is critical for Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Abeta generation is initiated when beta-secretase (BACE1) cleaves the amyloid precursor protein. For more than a decade, BACE1 has been a prime target for designing drugs to prevent or treat AD. However, development of such agents has turned out to be extremely challenging, with major hurdles in cell penetration, oral bioavailability/metabolic clearance, and brain access. Using a fragment-based chemistry strategy, we have generated LY2811376 [(S)-4-(2,4-difluoro-5-pyrimidin-5-yl-phenyl)-4-methyl-5,6-dihydro-4H-[1,3]thiazin-2-ylamine], the first orally available non-peptidic BACE1 inhibitor that produces profound Abeta-lowering effects in animals. The biomarker changes obtained in preclinical animal models translate into man at doses of LY2811376 that were safe and well tolerated in healthy volunteers. Prominent and long-lasting Abeta reductions in lumbar CSF were measured after oral dosing of 30 or 90 mg of LY2811376. This represents the first translation of BACE1-driven biomarker changes in CNS from preclinical animal models to man. Because of toxicology findings identified in longer-term preclinical studies, this compound is no longer progressing in clinical development. However, BACE1 remains a viable target because the adverse effects reported here were recapitulated in LY2811376-treated BACE1 KO mice and thus are unrelated to BACE1 inhibition. The magnitude and duration of central Abeta reduction obtainable with BACE1 inhibition positions this protease as a tractable small-molecule target through which to test the amyloid hypothesis in man.

22091989|t|Binding of inositol stereoisomers to model amyloidogenic peptides.
22091989|a|The self-aggregation of proteins into amyloid fibrils is a pathological hallmark of numerous incurable diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. scyllo-Inositol is a stereochemistry-dependent in vitro inhibitor of amyloid formation. As the first step to elucidate its mechanism of action, we present molecular dynamics simulations of scyllo-inositol and its inactive stereoisomer, chiro-inositol, with simple peptide models, alanine dipeptide (ADP) and (Gly-Ala)(4). We characterize molecular interactions and compute equilibrium binding constants between inositol and ADP as well as, successively, monomers, amorphous aggregates, and fibril-like beta-sheet aggregates of (Gly-Ala)(4). Inositol interacts weakly with all peptide systems considered, with millimolar to molar affinities, and displaces the conformational equilibria of ADP but not of the (Gly-Ala)(4) systems. However, scyllo- and chiro-inositol adopt different binding modes on the surface of beta-sheet aggregates. These results suggest that inositol does not inhibit amyloid formation by breaking up preformed aggregates but rather by binding to the surface of prefibrillar aggregates.

22094714|t|Role of APP for dendritic spine formation and stability.
22094714|a|The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is transported in high amounts to the presynaptic endings where its function is still unknown. Several studies indicate that lack of APP or its overexpression affects the number of dendritic spines, the postsynaptic compartment of excitatory synapses. Since synapse loss has been identified as one of the most important structural correlates of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's diseases (AD), the physiological function of APP at synapses, specifically at dendritic spines, has come into focus in AD research. This review intends to give an overview of the very controversial results on APP expression on dendritic spine number in the mouse brain.

22098589|t|Ethionamide boosters. 2. Combining bioisosteric replacement and structure-based drug design to solve pharmacokinetic issues in a series of potent 1,2,4-oxadiazole EthR inhibitors.
22098589|a|Mycobacterial transcriptional repressor EthR controls the expression of EthA, the bacterial monooxygenase activating ethionamide, and is thus largely responsible for the low sensitivity of the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis to this antibiotic. We recently reported structure-activity relationships of a series of 1,2,4-oxadiazole EthR inhibitors leading to the discovery of potent ethionamide boosters. Despite high metabolic stability, pharmacokinetic evaluation revealed poor mice exposure; therefore, a second phase of optimization was required. Herein a structure-property relationship study is reported according to the replacement of the two aromatic heterocycles: 2-thienyl and 1,2,4-oxadiazolyl moieties. This work was done using a combination of structure-based drug design and in vitro/ex vivo evaluations of ethionamide boosters on the targeted protein EthR and on the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Thanks to this process, we identified compound 42 (BDM41906), which displays improved efficacy in addition to high exposure to mice after oral administration.

22101005|t|The effect of amyloid associated proteins on the expression of genes involved in amyloid-beta clearance by adult human astrocytes.
22101005|a|Astrocytes appear to be important mediators in the clearance of amyloid beta1-42 (Abeta), the key component of senile plaques characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, we found the amyloid associated proteins (AAPs) alpha1-antichymotrypsin (ACT), apolipoprotein J and E (ApoJ and ApoE) and a mixture of serum amyloid P (SAP) and C1q (SAP-C1q) to modify Abeta-uptake by human astrocytes. Here we investigated the effect of oligomeric (Abetaoligo) and fibrillar Abeta (Abetafib), alone and in combination with a panel of AAPs on the astrocytic expression of genes proposed to be involved in Abeta-uptake and degradation. Primary human astrocytes (isolated from non-demented control (n=4) and AD patient (n=4) brain specimens) were exposed to either Abetaoligo or Abetafib preparations with or without the above mentioned AAPs. Quantitative gene expression analysis of Abeta-receptors Scavenger receptor B1 (SCARB1), macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO) and low density lipoprotein receptor related protein-2 (LRP2 or megalin) as well as of Abeta-degrading enzymes neprilysin (NEP), insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) and metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) was performed by real-time PCR. Basal expression of NEP, IDE and SCARB1 was easily detected whereas expression of MARCO, LRP2 and MMP-9 could only be detected upon pre-amplification. Basal expression of NEP, IDE and SCARB1 did not change upon exposure to Abetaoligo or Abetafib alone in any of the investigated astrocyte cultures. Interestingly NEP expression was increased upon exposure to ApoE in combination with both Abeta-preparations, and also SCARB1 expression was induced upon treatment with ApoE in combination with Abetafib in astrocytes from non-demented controls. Further, SAP-C1q increased SCARB1 expression in control astrocytes when combined with Abetaoligo. These alterations were not found in astrocytes from AD patients. Thus, we conclude that Abeta alone apparently does not affect the astrocytic expression of IDE, NEP or SCARB1. However, NEP and SCARB1 expression is increased in astrocytes from non-demented subjects when exposed to Abeta combined with AAPs like ApoE. These astrocytic gene expression-regulatory mechanisms appear to be defective in AD and thus might contribute to the development and progression of AD pathology.

22101365|a|We present a practical guide for the implementation of recently revised National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association guidelines for the neuropathologic assessment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Major revisions from previous consensus criteria are: (1) recognition that AD neuropathologic changes may occur in the apparent absence of cognitive impairment, (2) an "ABC" score for AD neuropathologic change that incorporates histopathologic assessments of amyloid beta deposits (A), staging of neurofibrillary tangles (B), and scoring of neuritic plaques (C), and (3) more detailed approaches for assessing commonly co-morbid conditions such as Lewy body disease, vascular brain injury, hippocampal sclerosis, and TAR DNA binding protein (TDP)-43 immunoreactive inclusions. Recommendations also are made for the minimum sampling of brain, preferred staining methods with acceptable alternatives, reporting of results, and clinico-pathologic correlations.

22101739|t|Regulation of IL-1beta-induced cyclooxygenase-2 expression by interactions of Abeta peptide, apolipoprotein E and nitric oxide in human neuroglioma.
22101739|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by chronic neuroinflammation, which may lead to dysfunction in neuronal circuits. Although reactive microglia are found in association with accumulation of beta amyloid (Abeta) plaques in the AD brain, their contribution to neuronal cell loss remains speculative. A major genetic risk factor for sporadic AD is inheritance of the apolipoprotein (apo) E4 allele, which has been shown to contribute significantly to neurodegeneration in AD. Many studies have documented the ability of Abeta fibrils in vitro to induce microglia to undergo phenotypic activation, which results in the secretion and/or expression of a plethora of free radicals and pro-inflammatory mediators. These mediators, such as reactive nitrogen/oxygen species and IL-1beta as well as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) with associated prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)), are believed to be neurotoxic and to contribute to the underlying cause of AD. We have used the human H4 neuroglioma cells as a model astroglial system to examine the interactions between IL-1beta and nitric oxide (NO) as co-stimulators of Abeta(1-40) in enhancing the expression of COX-2 and production of PGE(2) in the presence of recombinant human apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4). Neither Abeta(1-40) nor its reverse sequence analog Abeta(40-1) alone had a significant effect on COX-2 expression and PGE(2) production in the cells. In contrast, after co-incubation with apoE4, Abeta(1-40) increased IL-1beta-induced COX-2 expression and PGE(2) production. Abeta(12-28), which binds with high affinity to apoE4, blocked apoE4-mediated effects on Abeta(1-40). Furthermore, (+-)-S-Nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), an agent that releases nitric oxide (NO) in situ, alone did not affect IL-1beta-induced COX-2 expression, but increased PGE(2) production only. Addition of Abeta(1-40) preincubated with apoE4 to H4 cells in the presence of SNAP led to an additive IL-1beta-induced COX-2 expression and PGE(2) production. These observations indicate that increased PGE(2) resulted from increased nitrosative stress, which is enhanced by apoE4. Thus a molecular understanding of the interactions of apoE4 with Abeta, NO and IL-1beta on the regulation of the COX-2/prostaglandin pathway may open new avenues in understanding the mechanism of development of neurodegenerative disease such as AD.

22102154|t|Cryptotanshinione inhibits beta-amyloid aggregation and protects damage from beta-amyloid in SH-SY5Y cells.
22102154|a|The deposition of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) fibrils into plaques within the brain parenchyma and along cerebral blood vessels is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta42 oligomers and fibrils cause the breakdown of neural circuits, neuronal death and eventually dementia. Drugs that inhibit Abeta42 aggregation may be a novel direction in AD drug discovery. Cryptotanshinone (CTS), an active component of the medicinal herb Salvia miltiorrhiza, has been shown to improve learning and memory in several pharmacological models of AD. However, the effects of CTS on the Abeta aggregation and toxicity are unclear. The current work shows the effectiveness of CTS on the inhibition of Abeta42 aggregation and toxicity to human neuroblastoma cells. In this study, we demonstrated that CTS can inhibit Abeta42 spontaneous aggregation using thioflavin T fluorescence assay and transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of CTS on Abeta-induced oxidative cell death in cultured SH-SY5Y cells. MTT and lactate dehydrogenase assays showed that CTS reduced the cytotoxicity induced by Abeta42. CTS also dramatically reduced Abeta42-induced cellular apoptosis and increased level of reactive oxygen species in these cells. Our study suggests that CTS may be useful in the inhibition or prevention of AD development and progression.

22102410|t|Binding with nucleic acids or glycosaminoglycans converts soluble protein oligomers to amyloid.
22102410|a|Ample evidence suggests that almost all polypeptides can either adopt a native structure (folded or intrinsically disordered) or form misfolded amyloid fibrils. Soluble protein oligomers exist as an intermediate between these two states, and their cytotoxicity has been implicated in the pathology of multiple human diseases. However, the mechanism by which soluble protein oligomers develop into insoluble amyloid fibrils is not clear, and investigation of this important issue is hindered by the unavailability of stable protein oligomers. Here, we have obtained stabilized protein oligomers generated from common native proteins. These oligomers exert strong cytotoxicity and display a common conformational structure shared with known protein oligomers. They are soluble and remain stable in solution. Intriguingly, the stabilized protein oligomers interact preferentially with both nucleic acids and glycosaminoglycans (GAG), which facilitates their rapid conversion into insoluble amyloid. Concomitantly, binding with nucleic acids or GAG strongly diminished the cytotoxicity of the protein oligomers. EGCG, a small molecule that was previously shown to directly bind to protein oligomers, effectively inhibits the conversion to amyloid. These results indicate that stabilized oligomers of common proteins display characteristics similar to those of disease-associated protein oligomers and represent immediate precursors of less toxic amyloid fibrils. Amyloid conversion is potently expedited by certain physiological factors, such as nucleic acids and GAGs. These findings concur with reports of cofactor involvement with disease-associated amyloid and shed light on potential means to interfere with the pathogenic properties of misfolded proteins.

22108168|t|Cholesterol promotes the interaction of Alzheimer beta-amyloid monomer with lipid bilayer.
22108168|a|Cholesterol in the plasma membrane plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, but the exact function of cholesterol in the regulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) generation, aggregation, and toxicity remains elusive. To gain insight into the bioactivity of cholesterol, we investigate the effect of cholesterol levels on the interaction of Abeta(1-42) monomer with the zwitterionic 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) bilayer containing different mole fractions of cholesterol from chi=0, 0.2, to 0.4 using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Simulation results show that an increased cholesterol level alters the structure, dynamics, and surface chemistry of the lipid bilayer, leading to increased bilayer thickness, hydrophobic chain order, surface hydrophobicity, and decreased lipid mobility. All these effects significantly promote the binding of Abeta to the lipid bilayer. Mechanistically, the adsorption of Abeta on the bilayer is a cooperative process. First, charged residues act as anchors to establish the initial binding of Abeta to phosphate headgroups of the bilayer driven by electrostatic interactions, which further facilitates hydrophobic residues to reside on the bilayer. Once hydrophobic residues especially from C-terminus are locked on the bilayer, the interactions among charged residues, lipid bilayer, and calcium ions are optimized to provide additional attractive forces to stabilize Abeta adsorbed on or inserted into the lipid bilayer. Inclusion of cholesterol makes this binding process more energetically favorable. Upon adsorption on the bilayer, Abeta appears to preferentially adopt alpha-helical or unstructured conformation. This work supports that cholesterol acts as a promoter for Abeta--membrane interactions, which would facilitate Abeta aggregation and membrane insertion.

22108346|t|Identification and characterization of diarylimidazoles as hybrid inhibitors of butyrylcholinesterase and amyloid beta fibril formation.
22108346|a|In this contribution, a chemical collection of aromatic compounds was screened for inhibition on butyrylcholinesterase (BChE)'s hydrolase activity using Ellman's reaction. A set of diarylimidazoles was identified as highly selective inhibitors of BChE hydrolase activity and amyloid beta (Abeta) fibril formation. New derivatives were synthesized resulting in several additional hits, from which the most active was 6c, 4-(3-ethylthiophenyl)-2-(3-thienyl)-1H-imidazole, an uncompetitive inhibitor of BChE hydrolase activity (IC50 BChE=0.10 muM; K(i)=0.073 +- 0.011 muM) acting also on Abeta fibril formation (IC50=5.8 muM). With the aid of structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies, chemical motifs influencing the BChE inhibitory activity of these imidazoles were proposed. These bifunctional inhibitors represent good tools in basic studies of BChE and/or promising lead molecules for AD therapy.

22116192|t|Tau elevations in the brain extracellular space correlate with reduced amyloid-beta levels and predict adverse clinical outcomes after severe traumatic brain injury.
22116192|a|Axonal injury is believed to be a major determinant of adverse outcomes following traumatic brain injury. However, it has been difficult to assess acutely the severity of axonal injury in human traumatic brain injury patients. We hypothesized that microdialysis-based measurements of the brain extracellular fluid levels of tau and neurofilament light chain, two low molecular weight axonal proteins, could be helpful in this regard. To test this hypothesis, 100 kDa cut-off microdialysis catheters were placed in 16 patients with severe traumatic brain injury at two neurological/neurosurgical intensive care units. Tau levels in the microdialysis samples were highest early and fell over time in all patients. Initial tau levels were >3-fold higher in patients with microdialysis catheters placed in pericontusional regions than in patients in whom catheters were placed in normal-appearing right frontal lobe tissue (P = 0.005). Tau levels and neurofilament light-chain levels were positively correlated (r = 0.6, P = 0.013). Neurofilament light-chain levels were also higher in patients with pericontusional catheters (P = 0.04). Interestingly, initial tau levels were inversely correlated with initial amyloid-beta levels measured in the same samples (r = -0.87, P = 0.000023). This could be due to reduced synaptic activity in areas with substantial axonal injury, as amyloid-beta release is closely coupled with synaptic activity. Importantly, high initial tau levels correlated with worse clinical outcomes, as assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale 6 months after injury (r = -0.6, P = 0.018). Taken together, our data add support for the hypothesis that axonal injury may be related to long-term impairments following traumatic brain injury. Microdialysis-based measurement of tau levels in the brain extracellular space may be a useful way to assess the severity of axonal injury acutely in the intensive care unit. Further studies with larger numbers of patients will be required to assess the reproducibility of these findings and to determine whether this approach provides added value when combined with clinical and radiological information.

22116809|t|Amyloid-beta contributes to blood-brain barrier leakage in transgenic human amyloid precursor protein mice and in humans with cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
22116809|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a degenerative disorder characterized by amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition in the blood-brain barrier (BBB). CAA contributes to injuries of the neurovasculature including lobar hemorrhages, cortical microbleeds, ischemia, and superficial hemosiderosis. We postulate that CAA pathology is partially due to Abeta compromising the BBB. METHODS: We characterized 19 patients with acute stroke with "probable CAA" for neurovascular pathology based on MRI and clinical findings. Also, we studied the effect of Abeta on the expression of tight junction proteins and matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) in isolated rat brain microvessels. RESULTS: Two of 19 patients with CAA had asymptomatic BBB leakage and posterior reversible encephalopathic syndrome indicating increased BBB permeability. In addition to white matter changes, diffusion abnormality suggesting lacunar ischemia was found in 4 of 19 patients with CAA; superficial hemosiderosis was observed in 7 of 9 patients. Abeta(40) decreased expression of the tight junction proteins claudin-1 and claudin-5 and increased expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Analysis of brain microvessels from transgenic mice overexpressing human amyloid precursor protein revealed the same expression pattern for tight junction and MMP proteins. Consistent with reduced tight junction and increased MMP expression and activity, permeability was increased in brain microvessels from human amyloid precursor protein mice compared with microvessels from wild-type controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that Abeta contributes to changes in brain microvessel tight junction and MMP expression, which compromises BBB integrity. We conclude that Abeta causes BBB leakage and that assessing BBB permeability could potentially help characterize CAA progression and be a surrogate marker for treatment response.

22118948|t|The Arctic amyloid-beta precursor protein (AbetaPP) mutation results in distinct plaques and accumulation of N- and C-truncated Abeta.
22118948|a|The Arctic (p. E693G) mutation in the amyloid-beta precursor protein (AbetaPP) facilitates amyloid-beta (Abeta) protofibril formation and generates clinical symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, molecular details of Abeta in post mortem brain were investigated with biochemical and morphological techniques. The basic structure of Arctic plaques resembled cotton wool plaques. However, they appeared ring-formed with Abeta42-specific antibodies, but were actually targetoid, since the periphery and center of many parenchymal Abeta deposits stained differently with mid-domain, N- and C-terminal Abeta antibodies. Abeta fibrils were similar in shape, albeit shorter than in sporadic AD brain, when examined by electron microscopy. Abetawild-type and Abetaarctic codeposited and parenchymal deposits were highly enriched in both N- and C-terminally truncated Abeta. In contrast, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) contained a substantial amount of Abeta1-40. The absence of plaques with cores of fibrillary Abeta might be due to the scarcity of full-length Abeta, although other mechanisms could be involved. Our findings are discussed in relation to mechanisms and relevance of amyloid formation and to the clinical features of AD.

22119000|t|Estrogen protects against amyloid-beta toxicity by estrogen receptor alpha-mediated inhibition of Daxx translocation.
22119000|a|Estrogen was shown to promote neuronal survival against several neurotoxic insults including beta-amyloid (Abeta). The proposed mechanism includes the activation of the mitogen activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Mapk/Erk), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathways and the upregulation of antiapoptotic proteins. On the other hand, Abeta neurotoxicity depends on the activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (Ask1), and both Ask1 activity and Abeta toxicity are inhibited by thioredoxin-1 (Trx1). Here, we explored the possibility that estrogen could protect cells against Abeta(1-42) toxicity by inhibiting the Ask1 cascade or by modulating Trx1. Cytosolic translocation of death-associated protein Daxx was used as indicator of Ask1 activity. Using human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, 17beta-estradiol (E2) and specific agonists for estrogen receptor (ER) alpha or beta we demonstrated that nM concentrations of E2 protected against Abeta(1-42) by a mechanism depending upon ERalpha stimulation, Akt activation and Ask1 inhibition. Moreover, this protection would occur independently of ERbeta and the induction of Trx1 expression. Our results emphasize the importance of Ask1 cascade in Abeta toxicity, and of ERalpha and Ask1 as targets for developing new neuroprotective drugs.

22119192|t|MiR-106b impairs cholesterol efflux and increases Abeta levels by repressing ABCA1 expression.
22119192|a|ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) is a cholesterol transporter that transfers excess cellular cholesterol onto lipid-poor apolipoproteins. Given its critical role in cholesterol homeostasis, ABCA1 has been studied as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease. Transcriptional regulation of ABCA1 by liver X receptor has been well characterized. However, whether ABCA1 expression is regulated at the posttranscriptional level is largely unknown. Identification of a novel pathway that regulates ABCA1 expression may provide new strategy for regulating cholesterol metabolism and amyloid beta (Abeta) levels. Since ABCA1 has an unusually long 3' untranslated region, we investigated whether microRNAs could regulate ABCA1 expression. We identified miR-106b as a novel regulator of ABCA1 expression and Abeta metabolism. miR-106b significantly decreased ABCA1 levels and impaired cellular cholesterol efflux in neuronal cells. Furthermore, miR-106b dramatically increased levels of secreted Abeta by increasing Abeta production and preventing Abeta clearance. Alterations in Abeta production and clearance were rescued by expression of miR-106b-resistant ABCA1. Taken together, our data suggest that miR-106b affects Abeta metabolism by suppressing ABCA1 expression.

22119426|t|MicroRNA networks surrounding APP and amyloid-beta metabolism--implications for Alzheimer's disease.
22119426|a|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA regulators of protein synthesis that function as "fine-tuning" tools of gene expression in development and tissue homeostasis. Their profiles are significantly altered in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) that is characterized by both amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau deposition in brain. A key challenge remains in determining how changes in miRNA profiles translate into biological function in a physiological and pathological context. The key lies in identifying specific target genes for deregulated miRNAs and understanding which pathogenic factors trigger their deregulation. Here we review the literature about the intricate network of miRNAs surrounding the regulation of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) from which Abeta is derived by proteolytic cleavage. Normal brain function is highly sensitive to any changes in APP metabolism and miRNAs function at several steps to ensure that the correct APP end product is produced and in the right form and abundance. Disruptions in this miRNA regulatory network may therefore alter Abeta production, which in turn can affect miRNA expression.

22120156|t|Physiological functions of the amyloid precursor protein secretases ADAM10, BACE1, and presenilin.
22120156|a|Alzheimer's disease causing mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) or in the Presenilin 1 (PS1) or Presenilin 2 (PS2) genes increase the production of amyloid peptides (Abeta) that precipitate in amyloid plaques. Since amyloid plaques are also a prominent feature of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), abnormal proteolysis of APP and the generation of amyloid beta (Abeta) are key events in the pathogenesis of AD. The proteases (secretases) that cleave APP are therefore important therapeutic targets, both for the rare familial forms but likely also for the sporadic forms of AD. The identification and understanding of the (neuro)biological functions of the alpha-, beta-, and presenilin/gamma-secretase (complexes) is important for the development of drugs and the delineation of their associated side effects. The potential impact of this type of research exceeds the AD field since the function of these secretases are also linked to cellular pathways like ectodomain shedding of growth factors and regulated intramembrane proteolysis of receptors in developmental biology, tissue homeostasis, and tumorigenesis. The generation of mice deficient in presenilin 1, presenilin 2, the alpha-secretase ADAM10, and the beta-secretases BACE1 and BACE2 were instrumental for the elucidation of the physiological functions of these proteases. Using these mouse models understanding how these secretases regulate amyloid peptide formation and how they exert their diverse biological functions could be significantly increased. This review attempts to summarize selected aspects of the current view of the multiple roles such proteases play in health and disease.

22121587|t|Microfluidic biosensor for beta-amyloid(1-42) detection using cyclic voltammetry.
22121587|a|Numerous studies have identified beta-amyloid(1-42) protein (Abeta42) in the cerebrospinal fluid as a potential biomarker of Alzheimer's disease. It is of particular interest to establish the diagnosis before reaching the stage of clinical severity. The current methods for studying amyloid detection, however, is often time-consuming, expensive, and labor intensive, making the analytical process very slow. Thus, a critical need exists for an analytical system that would enable the rapid investigation of amyloid formation with a very small amount of amyloidogenic peptides and reagents. In our present work, we report a simple microfluidic biosensor to analyze very small quantities of Abeta42 peptide on gold surface that were modified with Au nano-particles onto the thiol groups of self-assembled 1,6-hexandithiol cross-linkers. The vital advantage of this method includes retaining the bioactivity and environment similar to nature for protein immobilization while using minimal amounts of reagents and highly sensitive detection.

22121879|t|Identification and biology of alpha-secretase.
22121879|a|'Secretase' is a generic term coined more than 20 years ago to refer to a group of proteases responsible for the cleavage of a vast number of membrane proteins. These endoproteolytic events result in the extracellular or intracellular release of soluble metabolites associated with a broad range of intrinsic physiological functions. alpha-Secretase refers to the activity targeting the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and generating sAPPalpha, a soluble extracellular fragment potentially associated with neurotrophic and neuroprotective functions. Several proteases from the a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) family, including ADAM10 and ADAM17, have been directly or indirectly associated with the constitutive and regulated alpha-secretase activities. Recent evidence in primary neuronal cultures indicates that ADAM10 may represent the genuine constitutive alpha-secretase. Mainly because alpha-secretase cleaves APP within the sequence of Abeta, the core component of the cerebral amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease, alpha-secretase activation is considered to be of therapeutic value. In this article, we will provide a historical perspective on the characterization of alpha-secretase and review the recent literature on the identification and biology of the current alpha-secretase candidates.

22121920|a|For nearly 100 years following the first description of this neurological disorder by Dr Alois Alzheimer, amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles have been hypothesized to cause neuronal loss. With evidence that the extent of insoluble, deposited amyloid poorly correlated with cognitive impairment, research efforts focused on soluble forms of Abeta, also referred as Abeta oligomers. Following a decade of studies, soluble oligomeric forms of Abeta are now believed to induce the deleterious cascade(s) involved in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. In this review, we will discuss our current understanding about endogenous oligomeric Abeta production, their relative toxicity in vivo and in vitro, and explore the potential future directions needed for the field.

22121980|t|The role of metallobiology and amyloid-beta peptides in Alzheimer's disease.
22121980|a|The biggest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease is the process of ageing, but the mechanisms that lead to the manifestation of the disease remain to be elucidated. Why age triggers the disease is unclear but an emerging theme is the inability for a cell to efficiently maintain many key processes such as energy production, repair, and regenerative mechanisms. Metal ions are essential to the metabolic function of every cell. This review will explore the role and reported changes in metal ions in Alzheimer disease, particularly the brain, blood and cerebral spinal fluid, emphasizing how iron, copper and zinc may be involved through the interactions with amyloid precursor protein, the proteolytically cleaved peptide amyloid-beta (Abeta), and other related metalloproteins. Finally, we explore the monomeric makeup of possible Abeta dimers, what a dimeric Abeta species from Alzheimer's disease brain tissue is likely to be composed of, and discuss how metals may influence Abeta production and toxicity via a copper catalyzed dityrosine cross-link.

22122056|t|gamma-Secretase inhibitors and modulators for Alzheimer's disease.
22122056|a|gamma-Secretase is a membrane embedded aspartyl protease complex with presenilin as the catalytic component. Along with beta-secretase, this enzyme produces the amyloid beta-protein of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from the amyloid beta-protein precursor. Because of its key role in the pathogenesis of AD, gamma-secretase has been a prime target for drug discovery, and many inhibitors of this protease have been developed. The therapeutic potential of these inhibitors is virtually negated by the fact that gamma-secretase is an essential part of the Notch signaling pathway, rendering the compounds unacceptably toxic upon chronic exposure. However, these compounds have served as useful chemical tools for biological investigations. In contrast, gamma-secretase modulators continue to be of keen interest as possible AD therapeutics. These modulators either shift amyloid beta-protein production to shorter, less pathogenic peptides or inhibit the proteolysis of amyloid beta-protein precursor selectively compared to that of Notch. The various chemical types of inhibitors and modulators will be discussed, along with their use as probes for basic biology and their potential as AD therapeutics.

22122128|t|Amyloid beta: linking synaptic plasticity failure to memory disruption in Alzheimer's disease.
22122128|a|Mounting evidence suggests that amyloid beta-induced impairments in synaptic plasticity that is accompanied by cognitive decline and dementia represent key pathogenic steps of Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we review recent advances in the study of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease-associated synaptic dysfunction and memory deficits, and how these mechanisms could provide novel avenues for therapeutic intervention to treat this devastating neurodegenerative disease.

22122190|t|Cholinergic modulation of amyloid precursor protein processing with emphasis on M1 muscarinic receptor: perspectives and challenges in treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
22122190|a|The prescribed drugs for treatment of cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients are regarded as symptomatic drugs. Effective disease modifying therapies are not yet prescribed in AD patients. Three major hallmarks of AD (e.g. cholinergic hypofunction, Abeta and tau neuropathologies) are closely linked raising the expectation that restoring the cholinergic hypofunction to normal, in particular via selective activation of M1 muscarinic receptors, may alter the onset or progression of AD dementia. This review is focused mainly on modulation of amyloid precursor processing and Abeta levels in the brain via cholinergic treatment strategies based on M1 muscarinic agonists versus other cholinergic treatments (e.g. cholinesterase inhibitors prescribed for treatment of AD, M2 antagonists and nicotinic agonists). Advantages and potential drawbacks of these treatment modalities are reviewed versus the notion that due to an elusive etiology of AD, future disease modifiers should address comprehensively most of these AD hallmarks (e.g. Abeta pathology, tau and tangle pathologies, as well as the cholinergic hypofunction and cognitive impairments). This major requirement may be fulfilled with M1-selective muscarinic agonists and less with other reviewed cholinergic treatments.

22122230|t|Are amyloid-degrading enzymes viable therapeutic targets in Alzheimer's disease?
22122230|a|: The amyloid cascade hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease envisages that the initial elevation of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) levels, especially of Abeta(1-42) , is the primary trigger for the neuronal cell death specific to onset of Alzheimer's disease. There is now substantial evidence that brain amyloid levels are manipulable because of a dynamic equilibrium between their synthesis from the amyloid precursor protein and their removal by amyloid-degrading enzymes (ADEs) providing a potential therapeutic strategy. Since the initial reports over a decade ago that two zinc metallopeptidases, insulin-degrading enzyme and neprilysin (NEP), contributed to amyloid degradation in the brain, there is now an embarras de richesses in relation to this category of enzymes, which currently number almost 20. These now include serine and cysteine proteinases, as well as numerous zinc peptidases. The experimental validation for each of these enzymes, and which to target, varies enormously but up-regulation of several of them individually in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease has proved effective in amyloid and plaque clearance, as well as cognitive enhancement. The relative status of each of these enzymes will be critically evaluated. NEP and its homologues, as well as insulin-degrading enzyme, remain as principal ADEs and recently discovered mechanisms of epigenetic regulation of NEP expression potentially open new avenues in manipulation of AD-related genes, including ADEs.

22122349|t|Regulation of beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 gene expression and its role in Alzheimer's disease.
22122349|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder leading to dementia. Neuritic plaques are the hallmark neuropathology in AD brains. Proteolytic processing of amyloid-beta precursor protein at the beta site by beta-site amyloid-beta precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is essential to generate Abeta, a central component of the neuritic plaques. BACE1 is increased in some sporadic AD brains, and dysregulation of BACE1 gene expression plays an important role in AD pathogenesis. This review will focus on the regulation of BACE1 gene expression at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translation initiation, translational and post-translational levels, and its role in AD pathogenesis. Further studies on BACE1 gene expression regulation will greatly contribute to our understanding of AD pathogenesis and reveal potential novel approaches for AD prevention and drug development.

22122372|t|Proteolytic processing of Alzheimer's beta-amyloid precursor protein.
22122372|a|beta-Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). APP undergoes post-translational proteolysis/processing to generate the hydrophobic beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides. Deposition of Abeta in the brain, forming oligomeric Abeta and plaques, is identified as one of the key pathological hallmarks of AD. The processing of APP to generate Abeta is executed by beta- and gamma-secretase and is highly regulated. Abeta toxicity can lead to synaptic dysfunction, neuronal cell death, impaired learning/memory and abnormal behaviors in AD models in vitro and in vivo. Aside from Abeta, proteolytic cleavages of APP can also give rise to the APP intracellular domain, reportedly involved in multiple types of cellular events such as gene transcription and apoptotic cell death. In addition to amyloidogenic processing, APP can also be cleaved by alpha-secretase to form a soluble or secreted APP ectodomain (sAPP-alpha) that has been shown to be mostly neuro-protective. In this review, we describe the mechanisms involved in APP metabolism and the likely functions of its various proteolytic products to give a better understanding of the patho/physiological functions of APP.

22122663|t|The physiology of the beta-amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain AICD.
22122663|a|The amyloid-beta precursor protein (betaAPP) undergoes several cleavages by enzymatic activities called secretases. Numerous studies aimed at studying the biogenesis and catabolic fate of Abeta peptides, the proteinaceous component of the senile plaques that accumulate in Alzheimer's disease-affected brains. Relatively recently, another secretase-mediated beta-APP-derived catabolite called APP IntraCellular Domain (AICD) entered the game. Whether AICD corresponded to a biologically inert by-pass product of betaAPP processing or whether it could harbor its own function remained questionable. In this study, we review the mechanisms by which AICD is generated and how its production is regulated. Furthermore, we discuss the degradation mechanism underlying its rapid catabolic fate. Finally, we review putative AICD-related functions and more particularly, the numerous studies indicating that AICD could translocate to the nucleus and control at a transcriptional level, the expression of a series of proteins involved in various functions including the control of cell death and Abeta degradation.

22122681|t|Developing beta-secretase inhibitors for treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
22122681|a|beta-Secretase (memapsin 2; BACE-1) is the first protease in the processing of amyloid precursor protein leading to the production of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the brain. It is believed that high levels of brain Abeta are responsible for the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, beta-secretase is a major therapeutic target for the development of inhibitor drugs. During the past decade, steady progress has been made in the evolution of beta-secretase inhibitors toward better drug properties. Recent inhibitors are potent, selective and have been shown to penetrate the blood-brain barrier to inhibit Abeta levels in the brains of experimental animals. Moreover, continuous administration of a beta-secretase inhibitor was shown to rescue age-related cognitive decline in transgenic AD mice. A small number of beta-secretase inhibitors have also entered early phase clinical trials. These developments offer some optimism for the clinical development of a disease-modifying drug for AD.

22129071|t|Template-assisted lateral growth of amyloid-beta42 fibrils studied by differential labeling with gold nanoparticles.
22129071|a|Amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) aggregation into amyloid fibrils is central to the origin and development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet this highly complex process is poorly understood at the molecular level. Extensive studies have shown that Abeta fibril growth occurs through fibril elongation, whereby soluble molecules add to the fibril ends. Nevertheless, fibril morphology strongly depends on aggregation conditions. For example, at high ionic strength, Abeta fibrils laterally associate into bundles. To further study the mechanisms leading to fibril growth, we developed a single-fibril growth assay based on differential labeling of two Abeta42 variants with gold nanoparticles. We used this assay to study Abeta42 fibril growth under different conditions and observed that bundle formation is preceded by lateral interaction of soluble Abeta42 molecules with pre-existing fibrils. Based on this data, we propose template-assisted lateral fibril growth as an additional mechanism to elongation for Abeta42 fibril growth.

22129351|t|Dihydroxybenzoic acid isomers differentially dissociate soluble biotinyl-Abeta(1-42) oligomers.
22129351|a|Polyphenolic compounds including a number of natural products such as resveratrol, curcumin, catechin derivatives, and nordihydroguaiaretic acid have effects on the assembly of Abeta fibrils and oligomers as well as on fibril morphology. Based on a lead structure obtained from a screen of a small molecule diversity library, simple benzoic acid derivatives distinguished by the number and position of hydroxyls on the aromatic ring displayed different abilities to dissociate preformed biotinyl-Abeta(1-42) oligomers. The 2,3-, 2,5-, and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA) isomers were active oligomer dissociators. The remaining DHBA isomers and the monohydroxy and unsubstituted benzoic acids were inactive and did not compete with the active compounds to block oligomer dissociation. None of the compounds blocked oligomer assembly, indicating that they do not interact with monomeric Abeta to shift the oligomer-monomer equilibrium. Dissociating activity was not associated with quinone redox cycling capacity of the compounds. Gallic acid (3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid) stabilized biotinyl-Abeta(1-42) oligomers against intrinsic dissociation and blocked the effects of the active dissociators, independent of the concentration of dissociator. A model for the mechanism of action of the DHBA dissociators proposes that these compounds destabilize oligomer structure promoting progressive monomer dissociation rather than fissioning oligomers into smaller, but still macromolecular, species. Gallic acid blocks dissociation by stabilizing oligomers against this process.

22130659|a|We have investigated the site-specific backbone dynamics of mature amyloid beta (Abeta) fibrils using solid-state NMR spectroscopy. Overall, the known beta-sheet segments and the turn linking these two beta-strands exhibit high order parameters between 0.8 and 0.95, suggesting low conformational flexibility. The first approximately eight N-terminal and the last C-terminal residues exhibit lower order parameters between ~0.4 and 0.8. Interestingly, the order parameters increase again for the first two residues, Asp(1) and Ala(2), suggesting that the N terminus could carry some structural importance.

22130662|t|Apolipoprotein E promotes beta-amyloid trafficking and degradation by modulating microglial cholesterol levels.
22130662|a|Allelic variation in the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is the major risk factor of sporadic Alzheimer disease. ApoE is the primary cholesterol carrier in the brain. Previously, we demonstrated that intracellular degradation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides by microglia is dramatically enhanced in the presence of apoE. However, the molecular mechanisms subserving this effect remain unknown. This study reports a mechanistic link between apoE-regulated cholesterol homeostasis and Abeta degradation. We demonstrate that promoting intracellular Abeta degradation by microglia is a common feature of HDL apolipoproteins, including apoE and apoA-I. This effect was not dependent on the direct interaction of apoE and Abeta. Regulation of Abeta degradation was achieved by solely manipulating cellular cholesterol levels. The expression and the activity of Abeta degrading enzymes, however, were not regulated by cholesterol. We observed that reducing cellular cholesterol levels by apoE resulted in faster delivery of Abeta to lysosomes and enhanced degradation. Moreover, apoE facilitated the recycling of Rab7, a small GTPase responsible for recruiting the motor complex to late endosomes/lysosomes. These data indicate that faster endocytic trafficking of Abeta-containing vesicles in the presence of apoE resulted from efficient recycling of Rab7 from lysosomes to early endosomes. Thus, apoE-induced intracellular Abeta degradation is mediated by the cholesterol efflux function of apoE, which lowers cellular cholesterol levels and subsequently facilitates the intracellular trafficking of Abeta to lysosomes for degradation. These findings demonstrate a direct role of cholesterol in the intracellular Abeta degradation.

22133042|t|Hydrophobicity and conformational change as mechanistic determinants for nonspecific modulators of amyloid beta self-assembly.
22133042|a|The link between many neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and the aberrant folding and aggregation of proteins has prompted a comprehensive search for small organic molecules that have the potential to inhibit such processes. Although many compounds have been reported to affect the formation of amyloid fibrils and/or other types of protein aggregates, the mechanisms by which they act are not well understood. A large number of compounds appear to act in a nonspecific way affecting several different amyloidogenic proteins. We describe here a detailed study of the mechanism of action of one representative compound, lacmoid, in the context of the inhibition of the aggregation of the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) associated with Alzheimer's disease. We show that lacmoid binds Abeta(1-40) in a surfactant-like manner and counteracts the formation of all types of Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) aggregates. On the basis of these and previous findings, we are able to rationalize the molecular mechanisms of action of nonspecific modulators of protein self-assembly in terms of hydrophobic attraction and the conformational preferences of the polypeptide.

22133278|t|Amyloid-beta oligomers stimulate microglia through a tyrosine kinase dependent mechanism.
22133278|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been well characterized by the presence of reactive microglia, often associated with beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaque deposition. The oligomeric form of Abeta peptide (Abeta(o)) has neurotoxic effects in the presence of microglia and is suggested to potentiate proinflammatory changes in microglia in AD. Primary murine microglia cultures stimulated with Abeta(o) displayed increased protein phosphotyrosine and secreted tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha levels which were attenuated by the Src/Abl inhibitor, dasatinib. Intracerebroventricular infusions of Abeta(o) into C57BL6/J mice stimulated increased microgliosis and protein phosphotyrosine levels that were also attenuated by dasatinib administration. The rodent findings were validated in human AD brains versus age-matched controls demonstrating reactive microglial association with Abeta(o) deposits and increased microglial protein phosphotyrosine and phospho-Src levels. These data suggest a role for Abeta(o) in microglial activation through a tyrosine kinase-dependant pathway both in rodent models and human disease. Use of a selective nonreceptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor such as dasatinib to attenuate microglial-dependent proinflammatory changes may prove to be an important step toward developing anti-inflammatory treatments for AD.

22133718|t|Testing the right target and right drug at the right stage.
22133718|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the only leading cause of death for which no disease-modifying therapy is currently available. Recent disappointing trial results at the dementia stage of AD have raised multiple questions about our current approaches to the development of disease-modifying agents. Converging evidence suggests that the pathophysiological process of AD begins many years before the onset of dementia. So why do we keep testing drugs aimed at the initial stages of the disease process in patients at the end-stage of the illness?

22134919|t|Comparative lipidomic analysis of mouse and human brain with Alzheimer disease.
22134919|a|Lipids are key regulators of brain function and have been increasingly implicated in neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer disease (AD). Here, a systems-based approach was employed to determine the lipidome of brain tissues affected by AD. Specifically, we used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to profile extracts from the prefrontal cortex, entorhinal cortex, and cerebellum of late-onset AD (LOAD) patients, as well as the forebrain of three transgenic familial AD (FAD) mouse models. Although the cerebellum lacked major alterations in lipid composition, we found an elevation of a signaling pool of diacylglycerol as well as sphingolipids in the prefrontal cortex of AD patients. Furthermore, the diseased entorhinal cortex showed specific enrichment of lysobisphosphatidic acid, sphingomyelin, the ganglioside GM3, and cholesterol esters, all of which suggest common pathogenic mechanisms associated with endolysosomal storage disorders. Importantly, a significant increase in cholesterol esters and GM3 was recapitulated in the transgenic FAD models, suggesting that these mice are relevant tools to study aberrant lipid metabolism of endolysosomal dysfunction associated with AD. Finally, genetic ablation of phospholipase D(2), which rescues the synaptic and behavioral deficits of an FAD mouse model, fully normalizes GM3 levels. These data thus unmask a cross-talk between the metabolism of phosphatidic acid, the product of phospholipase D(2), and gangliosides, and point to a central role of ganglioside anomalies in AD pathogenesis. Overall, our study highlights the hypothesis generating potential of lipidomics and identifies novel region-specific lipid anomalies potentially linked to AD pathogenesis.

22138241|t|The iAbeta5p beta-breaker peptide regulates the Abeta(25-35) interaction with lipid bilayers through a cholesterol-mediated mechanism.
22138241|a|Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the deposition of aggregates of the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) in the brain. A potential therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease is the use of synthetic beta-sheet breaker peptides, which are capable of binding Abeta but unable to become part of a beta-sheet structure, thus inhibiting the peptide aggregation. Many studies suggest that membranes play a key role in the Abeta aggregation; consequently, it is strategic to investigate the interplay between beta-sheet breaker peptides and Abeta in the presence of lipid bilayers. In this work, we focused on the effect of the beta-sheet breaker peptide acetyl-LPFFD-amide, iAbeta5p, on the interaction of the Abeta(25-35) fragment with lipid membranes, studied by Electron Spin Resonance spectroscopy, using spin-labeled membrane components (either phospholipids or cholesterol). The ESR results show that iAbeta5p influences the Abeta(25-35) interaction with the bilayer through a cholesterol-mediated mechanism: iAbeta5p withholds cholesterol in the inner hydrophobic core of the bilayer, making the interfacial region more fluid and capable to accommodate Abeta(25-35). As a consequence, iAbeta5p prevents the Abeta(25-35) release from the lipid membrane, which is the first step of the beta-amyloid aggregation process.

22138302|t|Preferential interactions between ApoE-containing lipoproteins and Abeta revealed by a detection method that combines size exclusion chromatography with non-reducing gel-shift.
22138302|a|The association between apolipoprotein E (apoE) and amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) may significantly impact the function of both proteins, thus affecting the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, apoE/Abeta interactions remain fundamentally defined by the stringency of the detection method. Here we use size exclusion chromatography (SEC) as a non-stringent approach to the detection of apoE/Abeta interactions in solution, specifically apoE and both endogenous and exogenous Abeta from plasma, CSF and astrocyte conditioned media. By SEC analysis, Abeta association with plasma and CNS lipoproteins is apoE-dependent. While endogenous Abeta elutes to specific human plasma lipoproteins distinct from those containing apoE, it is the apoE-containing lipoproteins that absorb excess amounts of exogenous Abeta40. In human CSF, apoE, endogenous Abeta and phospholipid elute in an almost identical profile, as do apoE, exogenous Abeta and phospholipid from astrocyte conditioned media. Combining SEC fractionation with subsequent analysis for SDS-stable apoE/Abeta complex reveals that apoE-containing astrocyte lipoproteins exhibit the most robust interactions with Abeta. Thus, standardization of the methods for detecting apoE/Abeta complex is necessary to determine its functional significance in the neuropathology characteristic of AD. Importantly, a systematic understanding of the role of apoE-containing plasma and CNS lipoproteins in Abeta homeostasis could potentially contribute to identifying a plasma biomarker currently over-looked because it has multiple components.

22139836|t|Sublethal doses of beta-amyloid peptide abrogate DNA-dependent protein kinase activity.
22139836|a|Accumulation of DNA damage and deficiency in DNA repair potentially contribute to the progressive neuronal loss in neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer disease (AD). In multicellular eukaryotes, double strand breaks (DSBs), the most lethal form of DNA damage, are mainly repaired by the nonhomologous end joining pathway, which relies on DNA-PK complex activity. Both the presence of DSBs and a decreased end joining activity have been reported in AD brains, but the molecular player causing DNA repair dysfunction is still undetermined. beta-Amyloid (Abeta), a potential proximate effector of neurotoxicity in AD, might exert cytotoxic effects by reactive oxygen species generation and oxidative stress induction, which may then cause DNA damage. Here, we show that in PC12 cells sublethal concentrations of aggregated Abeta(25-35) inhibit DNA-PK kinase activity, compromising DSB repair and sensitizing cells to nonlethal oxidative injury. The inhibition of DNA-PK activity is associated with down-regulation of the catalytic subunit DNA-PK (DNA-PKcs) protein levels, caused by oxidative stress and reversed by antioxidant treatment. Moreover, we show that sublethal doses of Abeta(1-42) oligomers enter the nucleus of PC12 cells, accumulate as insoluble oligomeric species, and reduce DNA-PK kinase activity, although in the absence of oxidative stress. Overall, these findings suggest that Abeta mediates inhibition of the DNA-PK-dependent nonhomologous end joining pathway contributing to the accumulation of DSBs that, if not efficiently repaired, may lead to the neuronal loss observed in AD.

22142973|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, affecting 35 million people today. The search for new treatments is made ever more urgent by prospects for increasing prevalence due to population aging. Mouse models are one of the most important research tools for finding new treatments for AD. Here, we review those models. We begin by briefly reviewing the AD genetics on which mouse models are based and then consider the most common mouse models of AD, including mice transgenic for human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) and beta-amyloid (Abeta), mice expressing mutant presenilin genes, mice modeling tau's role in AD, and apolipoprotein E models. The discussion highlights key features and important differences between these mouse models. We conclude with a discussion about the role of AD mouse models in the translational pipeline.

22144675|t|Amyloid precursor protein revisited: neuron-specific expression and highly stable nature of soluble derivatives.
22144675|a|APP processing and amyloid-beta production play a central role in Alzheimer disease pathogenesis. APP has been considered a ubiquitously expressed protein. In addition to amyloid-beta, alpha- or beta-secretase-dependent cleavage of APP also generates soluble secreted APP (APPsalpha or APPsbeta, respectively). Interestingly, APPsbeta has been shown to be subject to further cleavage to create an N-APP fragment that binds to the DR6 death receptor and mediates axon pruning and degeneration under trophic factor withdrawal conditions. By performing APP immunocytochemical staining, we found that, unexpectedly, many antibodies yielded nonspecific staining in APP-null samples. Screening of a series of antibodies allowed us to identify a rabbit monoclonal antibody Y188 that is highly specific for APP and prompted us to re-examine the expression, localization, and stability of endogenous APP and APPsbeta in wild-type and in APPsbeta knock-in mice, respectively. In contrast to earlier studies, we found that APP is specifically expressed in neurons and that its expression cannot be detected in major types of glial cells under basal or neuroinflammatory conditions. Both APPsalpha and APPsbeta are highly stable in the central nervous system (CNS) and do not undergo further cleavage with or without trophic factor support. Our results clarify several key questions with regard to the fundamental properties of APP and offer critical cellular insights into the pathophysiology of APP.

22147283|t|Sesaminol glucosides protect beta-amyloid induced apoptotic cell death by regulating redox system in SK-N-SH cells.
22147283|a|We have investigated the neuroprotective effect of sesaminol glucosides (SG) in SK-N-SH cells. SG prevented apoptotic cell death induced by Abeta25-35. In parallel, SK-N-SH cells exposed to Abeta25-35 underwent oxidative stress as shown by the elevated level of intracellular ROS, lipid peroxidation, and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) formation, which were effectively suppressed by SG treatment. Furthermore, SG reversed the activities of catalase and glutathione peroxidase, and restored intracellular GSH levels in Abeta25-35 challenged SK-N-SH cells. In addition, SG inhibited not only Abeta25-35-induced apoptotic features including cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, activation of caspase-3, and activation of caspase-9, but also elevated Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in SK-N-SH cells treated with Abeta25-35. It was also observed that Abeta25-35 stimulated the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including extracellular protein regulated protein kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAP kinase. SG inhibited phosphorylation of the JNK, ERK and p38 MAP kinase. These results suggest that SG has a protective effect against Abeta25-35-induced neuronal apoptosis, possibly through scavenging oxidative stress and regulating MAPKs signaling pathways.

22147523|t|Secreted amyloid precursor proteins promote proliferation and glial differentiation of adult hippocampal neural progenitor cells.
22147523|a|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is an integral membrane glycoprotein present at high levels in nerve cells. Two soluble secreted forms, sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta, are processed from APP by two mutually exclusive proteolytic pathways. sAPPalpha shows a range of neuroprotective and growth factor properties, including reduction of neuronal injury and improvement in memory performance, in contrast to the generally less potent sAPPbeta. In addition, sAPPalpha has been shown to increase the proliferation of both embryonic neural stem cells and neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the adult brain. However, an effect of sAPPalpha (or sAPPbeta) on adult hippocampal progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation has not previously been observed. In this study, we examined the effect of both the alpha- and beta-cleaved ectodomains of sAPP on adult NPCs isolated from the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the rat hippocampus in the presence or absence of depolarizing conditions. Assays were performed to examine the effect of sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta on SGZ-derived adult NPC proliferation in parallel with SVZ-derived cells and on differentiation with SGZ-derived cells. We observed both sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta increased the proliferation of SGZ-derived NPCs in vitro. Further, treatment of SGZ-derived NPCs with either sAPPalpha or sAPPbeta increased the number of cells expressing the astrocytic marker GFAP and promoted cell survival. The effect on differential fate was observed in both the presence and absence of depolarizing conditions. Thus, both sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta exert a complex range of effects on SGZ-derived adult NPCs, including increasing NPC proliferation, maintaining cell viability, yet promoting glial over neuronal differentiation. These findings provide the first direct support for the secreted forms of APP regulating SGZ-derived NPCs, and raise the possibility some or all of the effects may have therapeutic benefit in models of neurological disease.

22148916|t|Dynamics of Zn(II) binding as a key feature in the formation of amyloid fibrils by Abeta11-28.
22148916|a|Supramolecular assembly of peptides and proteins into amyloid fibrils is of multifold interest, going from materials science to physiopathology. The binding of metal ions to amyloidogenic peptides is associated with several amyloid diseases, and amyloids with incorporated metal ions are of interest in nanotechnology. Understanding the mechanisms of amyloid formation and the role of metal ions can improve strategies toward the prevention of this process and enable potential applications in nanotechnology. Here, studies on Zn(II) binding to the amyloidogenic peptide Abeta11-28 are reported. Zn(II) modulates the Abeta11-28 aggregation, in terms of kinetics and fibril structures. Structural studies suggest that Abeta11-28 binds Zn(II) by amino acid residues Glu11 and His14 and that Zn(II) is rapidly exchanged between peptides. Structural and aggregation data indicate that Zn(II) binding induces the formation of the dimeric Zn(II)(1)(Abeta11-28)(2) species, which is the building block of fibrillar aggregates and explains why Zn(II) binding accelerates Abeta11-28 aggregation. Moreover, transient Zn(II) binding, even briefly, was enough to promote fibril formation, but the final structure resembled that of apo-Abeta11-28 amyloids. Also, seeding experiments, i.e., the addition of fibrillar Zn(II)(1)(Abeta11-28)(2) to the apo-Abeta11-28 peptide, induced aggregation but not propagation of the Zn(II)(1)(Abeta11-28)(2)-type fibrils. This can be explained by the dynamic Zn(II) binding between soluble and aggregated Abeta11-28. As a consequence, dynamic Zn(II) binding has a strong impact on the aggregation behavior of the Abeta11-28 peptide and might be a relevant and so far little regarded parameter in other systems of metal ions and amyloidogenic peptides.

22155633|t|Inhibiting effect of alpha(s1)-casein on Abeta(1-40) fibrillogenesis.
22155633|a|BACKGROUND: alpha(s1)-Casein is one of the four types of caseins, the largest protein component of bovine milk. The lack of a compact folded conformation and the capability to form micelles suggest a relationship of alpha(s1)-casein with the class of the intrinsically disordered (or natively unfolded) proteins. These proteins are known to exert a stabilizing activity on biomolecules through specific interaction with hydrophobic surfaces. In the present work we focused on the effect of alpha(s1)-casein on the fibrillogenesis of 1-40 beta-amyloid peptide, involved in Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: The aggregation kinetics of beta-peptide in presence and absence of alpha(s1)-casein was followed under shear at 37 C by recording the Thioflavine fluorescence, usually taken as an indicator of fibers formation. Measurements of Static and Dynamic Light Scattering, Circular Dichroism, and AFM imaging were done to reveal the details of alpha(s1)-casein-Abeta(1-40) interaction. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS: alpha(s1)-Casein addition sizably increases the lag-time of the nucleation phase and slows down the entire fibrillization process. alpha(s1)-Casein sequesters the amyloid peptide on its surface thus exerting a chaperone-like activity by means a colloidal inhibition mechanism. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Insights on the working mechanism of natural chaperones in preventing or controlling the amyloid aggregation.

22156579|t|A critical role for the PAR-1/MARK-tau axis in mediating the toxic effects of Abeta on synapses and dendritic spines.
22156579|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease and the leading cause of dementia in the elderly. Accumulating evidence supports soluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers as the leading candidate for the causative agent in AD and synapses as the primary site of Abeta oligomer action. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which Abeta oligomers cause synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairments remain poorly understood. Using primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons as a model system, we show that the partitioning defective-1 (PAR-1)/microtubule affinity-regulating kinase (MARK) family kinases act as critical mediators of Abeta toxicity on synapses and dendritic spines. Overexpression of MARK4 led to tau hyperphosphorylation, reduced expression of synaptic markers, and loss of dendritic spines and synapses, phenotypes also observed after Abeta treatment. Importantly, expression of a non-phosphorylatable form of tau with the PAR-1/MARK site mutated blocked the synaptic toxicity induced by MARK4 overexpression or Abeta treatment. To probe the involvement of endogenous MARK kinases in mediating the synaptic toxicity of Abeta, we employed a peptide inhibitor capable of effectively and specifically inhibiting the activities of all PAR-1/MARK family members. This inhibitor abrogated the toxic effects of Abeta oligomers on dendritic spines and synapses as assayed at the morphological and electrophysiological levels. Our results reveal a critical role for PAR-1/MARK kinases in AD pathogenesis and suggest PAR-1/MARK inhibitors as potential therapeutics for AD and possibly other tauopathies where aberrant tau hyperphosphorylation is involved.

22157754|t|Structural basis for increased toxicity of pathological abeta42:abeta40 ratios in Alzheimer disease.
22157754|a|The beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) is directly related to neurotoxicity in Alzheimer disease (AD). The two most abundant alloforms of the peptide co-exist under normal physiological conditions in the brain in an Abeta(42):Abeta(40) ratio of ~1:9. This ratio is often shifted to a higher percentage of Abeta(42) in brains of patients with familial AD and this has recently been shown to lead to increased synaptotoxicity. The molecular basis for this phenomenon is unclear. Although the aggregation characteristics of Abeta(40) and Abeta(42) individually are well established, little is known about the properties of mixtures. We have explored the biophysical and structural properties of physiologically relevant Abeta(42):Abeta(40) ratios by several techniques. We show that Abeta(40) and Abeta(42) directly interact as well as modify the behavior of the other. The structures of monomeric and fibrillar assemblies formed from Abeta(40) and Abeta(42) mixtures do not differ from those formed from either of these peptides alone. Instead, the co-assembly of Abeta(40) and Abeta(42) influences the aggregation kinetics by altering the pattern of oligomer formation as evidenced by a unique combination of solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, high molecular weight mass spectrometry, and cross-seeding experiments. We relate these observations to the observed enhanced toxicity of relevant ratios of Abeta(42):Abeta(40) in synaptotoxicity assays and in AD patients.

22159001|t|Coordination of copper(II) ions by the fragments of neuropeptide gamma containing D1, H9, H12 residues and products of copper-catalyzed oxidation.
22159001|a|A potentiometric, spectroscopic (UV-Vis, CD and EPR) and mass spectrometric (ESI-MS) study of Cu(II) binding to the (1-2,7-21)NPG, Asp(1)-Ala-Ile(7)-Ser-His(9)-Lys-Arg-His(12)-Lys-Thr-Asp-Ser-Phe-Val-Gly-Leu-Met(21)-NH(2), and Ac-(1-2,7-21)NPG, Ac-Asp(1)-Ala-Ile(7)-Ser-His(9)-Lys-Arg-His(12)-Lys-Thr-Asp-Ser-Phe-Val-Gly-Leu-Met(21)-NH(2), fragments of neuropeptide gamma were carried out. The results clearly indicate the stabilization of the 1 N {NH(2), beta-COO(-)}, 2 N {NH(2), beta-COO(-), N(Im)} and 3 N {NH(2), beta-COO(-), 2N(Im)} complexes by the coordination of the beta-carboxylate group of the D(1) residue. For the (1-2,7-21)NPG the CuH(2)L complex with 3 N {NH(2), beta-COO(-), 2N(Im)}, the binding mode dominates in a wide pH range of 4-8.5. With the sequential increase of pH, deprotonated amide nitrogens are involved in copper coordination. For the Ac-(1-2,7-21)NPG peptide the imidazole nitrogen atoms are the primary metal binding sites forming macrochelates in the pH range 4 to 7. The CuHL complex with 4 N {N(Im), N(-), N(-), N(Im)} coordination mode is formed in pH range 6-9. Deprotonation and co-ordination of the third amide nitrogen were detected at pH ~8.6. Metal-catalyzed oxidation (MCO) of proteins is mainly a site-specific process in which one or a few amino acids at metal-binding sites on the protein are preferentially oxidized. To elucidate the products of the copper(II)-catalyzed oxidation of the (1-2,7-21)NPG and Ac-(1-2,7-21)NPG, the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method and Cu(II)/hydrogen peroxide as a model oxidizing system were employed. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide with 1 : 4 peptide-H(2)O(2) molar ratio for the Ac-(1-2,7-21)NPG peptide the oxidation of the methionine residue to methionine sulfoxide and for (1-2,7-21)NPG to sulfone was observed. For the Cu(II)-peptide-hydrogen peroxide in 1 : 1 : 4 molar ratio systems, oxidation of the histidine residues to 2-oxohistidines was detected. Under experimental conditions the (1-2,7-21)NPG and Ac-(1-2,7-21)NPG undergo fragmentations by cleavage of the S(8)-H(9), H(9)-K(10), R(11)-H(12) and H(12)-K(13) peptide bonds supporting the participation of the H(9) and H(12) residues in the coordination of copper(II) ions. For the (1-2,7-21)NPG peptide chain the involvement of the D(1) residue in the coordination of metal ions is supported by the alkoxyl radical modification of this amino acid residue.

22159055|t|The APOE epsilon2 allele increases the risk of earlier age at onset in Machado-Joseph disease.
22159055|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate a modulating effect of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) polymorphism on age at onset of Machado-Joseph disease (MJD). DESIGN: We collected blood samples from 192 patients with MJD and typed the APOE polymorphism. Patients The 192 patients with MJD included 59 from the Azores, 73 from mainland Portugal, and 60 from Brazil. SETTING: Academic research center. RESULTS: Cases with the epsilon2/epsilon3 genotype had an earlier onset compared with those with the epsilon3/epsilon3 or the epsilon3/epsilon4 genotype. In this series of patients, the presence of an APOE epsilon2 allele implies a decrease of nearly 5 years in the age at onset. When combining several other predictors in a general linear model, namely, the presence/absence of the APOE epsilon2 allele, with the size of the (CAG)(n) in expanded alleles, the model was significantly improved and the explanation of onset variance was raised from 59.8% to 66.5%. Furthermore, the presence of the epsilon2 allele was associated with an onset before age 39 years (odds ratio, 5.00; 95% CI, 1.18-21.14). CONCLUSION: The polymorphism at the APOE gene plays a role as a genetic modifier of MJD phenotype.

22159114|t|Haploinsufficiency of human APOE reduces amyloid deposition in a mouse model of amyloid-beta amyloidosis.
22159114|a|The epsilon4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Evidence suggests that the effect of apoE isoforms on amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation in the brain plays a critical role in AD pathogenesis. Like in humans, apoE4 expression in animal models that develop Abeta amyloidosis results in greater Abeta and amyloid deposition than with apoE3 expression. However, whether decreasing levels of apoE3 or apoE4 would promote or attenuate Abeta-related pathology has not been directly addressed. To determine the effect of decreasing human apoE levels on Abeta accumulation in vivo, we generated human APOE isoform haploinsufficient mouse models by crossing APPPS1-21 mice with APOE isoform knock-in mice. By genetically manipulating APOE gene dosage, we demonstrate that decreasing human apoE levels, regardless of isoform status, results in significantly decreased amyloid plaque deposition and microglial activation. These differences in amyloid load between apoE3- and apoE4-expressing mice were not due to apoE4 protein being present at lower levels than apoE3. These data suggest that current therapeutic strategies to increase apoE levels without altering its lipidation state may actually worsen Abeta amyloidosis, while increasing apoE degradation or inhibiting its synthesis may be a more effective treatment approach.

22159144|t|Histidine-rich branched peptides as Cu(II) and Zn(II) chelators with potential therapeutic application in Alzheimer's disease.
22159144|a|Two histidine-rich branched peptides with one lysine as a branching unit have been designed and synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis. Their complex formation with Cu(II) and Zn(II) as well as their ability to attenuate the metal-ion induced amyloid aggregation has been characterized. Both peptides can keep Cu(II) and Zn(II) in complexed forms at pH 7.4 and can bind two equivalents of metal ions in solutions with excess metal. The stoichiometry, stability and structure of the complexes formed have been determined by pH potentiometry, UV-Vis spectrophotometry, circular dichroism, EPR and NMR spectroscopy and ESI-MS. Both mono- and bimetallic species have been detected over the whole pH range studied. The basic binding mode is either a tridentate {N(amino), N(amide), N(im)} or a histamine-type of coordination which is complemented by the binding of far imidazole or amino groups leading to macrochelate formation. The peptides were able to prevent Cu(II)-induced Abeta(1-40) aggregation but could not effectively compete for Zn(II) in vitro. Our results suggest that branched peptides containing potential metal-binding sites may be suitable metal chelators for reducing the risk of amyloid plaque formation in Alzheimer's disease.

22166205|t|DNA methylation of the 5'-untranslated region at +298 and +351 represses BACE1 expression in mouse BV-2 microglial cells.
22166205|a|BACE1, which cleaves the amyloid precursor protein, is the rate-limiting enzyme for beta-amyloid peptide production, leading to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A high plasma level of homocysteine, acting as a potent methyltransferase inhibitor, is assumed to be a risk factor for AD onset. Using the demethylating drug 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza), we tested whether and how BACE1 expression is regulated in mouse BV-2 microglial cells. 5-Aza increased both BACE1 mRNA and protein levels in a dose-dependent manner. Bisulfite-sequencing analysis revealed that two CpG sites at positions +298 and +351 in the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of the BACE1 gene were specifically demethylated in BV-2 cells treated with 5-Aza. In silico analysis showed that the +351 site is the STAT3/CTCF-binding site; the function of the +298 site has not been identified. To assess whether these two CpG sites play an important role in 5-Aza-induced transcriptional activation of BACE1, we constructed a BACE1 gene promoter including the 5'-UTR (-1136 to +500) fused to a CpG-free luciferase gene (pCpGL-BACE1) and its mutant pCpGL-BACE1-AA, which has substituted CG dinucleotides at the two CpG sites of pCpGL-BACE1 to AA. Promoter analysis showed a significant decrease (~30%) in the activity of pCpGL-BACE1-AA compared with that of pCpGL-BACE1. Furthermore, in vitro methylation of these two reporter constructs showed a complete silencing of their promoter activities. Our data demonstrate that BACE1 gene expression is regulated by DNA methylation of at least two CpG sites at positions +298 and +351 in the 5'-UTR in BV-2 microglial cells.

22170742|t|Cerebral hypoperfusion accelerates cerebral amyloid angiopathy and promotes cortical microinfarcts.
22170742|a|Cortical microinfarcts (CMIs) observed in brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease tend to be located close to vessels afflicted with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). CMIs in Alzheimer's disease are preferentially distributed in the arterial borderzone, an area most vulnerable to hypoperfusion. However, the causal association between CAA and CMIs remains to be elucidated. This study consists of two parts: (1) an observational study using postmortem human brains (n = 31) to determine the association between CAA and CMIs, and (2) an experimental study to determine whether hypoperfusion worsens CAA and induces CMIs in a CAA mouse model. In postmortem human brains, the density of CMIs was 0.113/cm(2) in mild, 0.584/cm(2) in moderate, and 4.370/cm(2) in severe CAA groups with a positive linear correlation (r = 0.6736, p < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis revealed that, among seven variables (age, disease, senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, CAA, atherosclerosis and white matter damage), only the severity of CAA was a significant multivariate predictor of CMIs (p = 0.0022). Consistent with the data from human brains, CAA model mice following chronic cerebral hypoperfusion due to bilateral common carotid artery stenosis induced with 0.18-mm diameter microcoils showed accelerated deposition of leptomeningeal amyloid beta (Abeta) with a subset of them developing microinfarcts. In contrast, the CAA mice without hypoperfusion exhibited very few leptomeningeal Abeta depositions and no microinfarcts by 32 weeks of age. Following 12 weeks of hypoperfusion, cerebral blood flow decreased by 26% in CAA mice and by 15% in wild-type mice, suggesting impaired microvascular function due to perivascular Abeta accumulation after hypoperfusion. Our results suggest that cerebral hypoperfusion accelerates CAA, and thus promotes CMIs.

22170879|t|Cerebrospinal fluid markers for differential dementia diagnosis in a large memory clinic cohort.
22170879|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine how amyloid beta 42 (Abeta42), total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) levels in CSF behave in a large cohort of patients with different types of dementia. METHODS: Baseline CSF was collected from 512 patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) and 272 patients with other types of dementia (OD), 135 patients with a psychiatric disorder (PSY), and 275 patients with subjective memory complaints (SMC). Abeta42, t-tau, and p-tau (at amino acid 181) were measured in CSF by ELISA. Autopsy was obtained in a subgroup of 17 patients. RESULTS: A correct classification of patients with AD (92%) and patients with OD (66%) was accomplished when CSF Abeta42 and p-tau were combined. Patients with progressive supranuclear palsy had normal CSF biomarker values in 90%. Patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease demonstrated an extremely high CSF t-tau at a relatively normal CSF p-tau. CSF AD biomarker profile was seen in 47% of patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), 38% in corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and almost 30% in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and vascular dementia (VaD). PSY and SMC patients had normal CSF biomarkers in 91% and 88%. Older patients are more likely to have a CSF AD profile. Concordance between clinical and neuropathologic diagnosis was 85%. CSF markers reflected neuropathology in 94%. CONCLUSION: CSF Abeta42, t-tau, and p-tau are useful in differential dementia diagnosis. However, in DLB, FTLD, VaD, and CBD, a substantial group exhibit a CSF AD biomarker profile, which requires more autopsy confirmation in the future.

22171030|t|Vesicular zinc regulates the Ca2+ sensitivity of a subpopulation of presynaptic vesicles at hippocampal mossy fiber terminals.
22171030|a|Synaptic vesicles segregate into functionally diverse subpopulations within presynaptic terminals, yet there is no information about how this may occur. Here we demonstrate that a distinct subgroup of vesicles within individual glutamatergic, mossy fiber terminals contain vesicular zinc that is critical for the rapid release of a subgroup of synaptic vesicles during increased activity in mice. In particular, vesicular zinc dictates the Ca(2+) sensitivity of release during high-frequency firing. Intense synaptic activity alters the subcellular distribution of zinc in presynaptic terminals and decreases the number of zinc-containing vesicles. Zinc staining also appears in endosomes, an observation that is consistent with the preferential replenishment of zinc-enriched vesicles by bulk endocytosis. We propose that functionally diverse vesicle pools with unique membrane protein composition support different modes of transmission and are generated via distinct recycling pathways.

22172527|t|Time sequence of oxidative stress in the brain from transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease related to the amyloid-beta cascade.
22172527|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial disorder characterized by the presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Rare early-onset forms of AD are associated with autosomal dominant mutations in the amyloid precursor protein gene, presenilin 1 gene, or presenilin 2 gene. The late-onset form of the disease (LOAD) is the most common form. The causes of LOAD are not yet clarified, but several environmental and genetic risk factors have been identified. Numerous studies have highlighted a role for free radical-mediated injury to brain regions of this illness. In addition, studies from mild cognitive impairment patients suggest that oxidative stress is an early event in the pathogenesis of AD. The associations between these markers of free radical damage and the pathogenic cascades involved in AD are complex. Over the past 2 decades, a number of mouse models have been created to recapitulate the major neuropathological hallmarks of AD, namely amyloid plaques and NFTs. These mice recapitulate many, although not all, of the key features of AD. Some strains of transgenic mice develop amyloid plaques, some accumulate NFTs, and some do both. Here we review the evidence for increased free radical-mediated damage to the brain with particular attention to the stage of the disease in various transgenic models of AD related to the amyloid-beta cascade.

22172925|t|Protective effect of cannabinoid CB1 receptor activation against altered intrinsic repetitive firing properties induced by Abeta neurotoxicity.
22172925|a|The amyloid beta (Abeta) protein is believed to be the key pathological mediator of Alzheimer's disease (AD) which is the first and most well known type of dementia. Despite a growing body of evidence indicating that Abeta neurotoxicity induces changes in synaptic function, little effort, if any, has been made to investigate the effect of in vivo Abeta treatment on intrinsic neuronal properties. The present study was designed to examine the effects that in vivo Abeta treatment have on the intrinsic repetitive firing properties of CA1 pyramidal neurons, using whole cell patch clamp recording. Protective effect of cannabinoid CB1 receptor activation was also investigated against Abeta-induced alterations in evoked electrophysiological activities. The findings from present study demonstrated that a bilateral injection of Abeta into the prefrontal cortex causes robust changes in activity-dependent electrophysiological responses in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. The effects of Abeta treatment alone was almost completely prevented by combined treatment with Abeta and ACEA, a selective CB1 receptor agonist. It can be concluded Abeta treatment reduces evoked neuronal activity and activation of CB1 cannabinoid receptors may have beneficial preventative effects on Abeta-induced electrophysiological changes.

22173317|t|Probucol, a lipid-lowering drug, prevents cognitive and hippocampal synaptic impairments induced by amyloid beta peptide in mice.
22173317|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by synaptic loss and cognitive impairments. The presence of extracellular senile plaques (mainly composed of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide) is an important molecular hallmark in AD and neuronal damage has been attributed, at least in part, to Abeta-mediated toxicity. Although the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of AD are not yet completely understood, several lines of evidence indicate that oxidative stress and cholesterol dyshomeostasis play crucial roles in mediating the synaptic loss and cognitive deficits observed in AD patients. This study evaluated the effects of Probucol, a phenolic lipid-lowering agent with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, on biochemical parameters related to oxidative stress and synaptic function (hippocampal glutathione and synaptophysin levels; glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and acetylcholinesterase activities; lipid peroxidation), as well as on behavioral parameters related to the cognitive function (displaced and new object recognition tasks) in Abeta-exposed mice. Animals were treated with a single intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of aggregated Abeta(1-40) (400 pmol/site) and, subsequently, received Probucol (10 mg/kg, i.p.) once a day, during the following 2 weeks. At the end of treatments, Abeta(1-40)-exposed animals showed a significant impairment on learning-memory ability, which was paralleled by a significant decrease in hippocampal synaptophysin levels, as well as by an increase in hippocampal acetylcholinesterase activity. Importantly, Probucol treatment blunted the deleterious effects of Abeta(1-40) on learning-memory ability and hippocampal biochemistry. Although Abeta(1-40) treatment did not change hippocampal glutathione levels and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities, Abeta(1-40)-exposed animals showed increased hippocampal lipid peroxidation and this event was completely blunted by Probucol treatment. These findings reinforce and extend the notion of the hazardous effects of Abeta(1-40) toward hippocampal synaptic homeostasis and cognitive functions. In addition, the present results indicate that Probucol is able to counteract the cognitive and biochemical impairments induced by i.c.v. Abeta(1-40) administration in mice. The study is the first to report the protective effects of Probucol (a "non-statin cholesterol-lowering drug") against Abeta(1-40)-induced synaptic and behavioral impairments, rendering this compound a promising molecule for further pharmacological studies on the search for therapeutic strategies to treat or prevent AD.

22173633|t|An impaired mitochondrial electron transport chain increases retention of the hypoxia imaging agent diacetylbis(4-methylthiosemicarbazonato)copperII.
22173633|a|Radiolabeled diacetylbis(4-methylthiosemicarbazonato)copper(II) [Cu(II)(atsm)] is an effective positron-emission tomography imaging agent for myocardial ischemia, hypoxic tumors, and brain disorders with regionalized oxidative stress, such as mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, and lactic acidosis with stroke-like episodes (MELAS) and Parkinson's disease. An excessively elevated reductive state is common to these conditions and has been proposed as an important mechanism affecting cellular retention of Cu from Cu(II)(atsm). However, data from whole-cell models to demonstrate this mechanism have not yet been provided. The present study used a unique cell culture model, mitochondrial xenocybrids, to provide whole-cell mechanistic data on cellular retention of Cu from Cu(II)(atsm). Genetic incompatibility between nuclear and mitochondrial encoded subunits of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) in xenocybrid cells compromises normal function of the ETC. As a consequence of this impairment to the ETC we show xenocybrid cells upregulate glycolytic ATP production and accumulate NADH. Compared to control cells the xenocybrid cells retained more Cu after being treated with Cu(II)(atsm). By transfecting the cells with a metal-responsive element reporter construct the increase in Cu retention was shown to involve a Cu(II)(atsm)-induced increase in intracellular bioavailable Cu specifically within the xenocybrid cells. Parallel experiments using cells grown under hypoxic conditions confirmed that a compromised ETC and elevated NADH levels contribute to increased cellular retention of Cu from Cu(II)(atsm). Using these cell culture models our data demonstrate that compromised ETC function, due to the absence of O(2) as the terminal electron acceptor or dysfunction of individual components of the ETC, is an important determinant in driving the intracellular dissociation of Cu(II)(atsm) that increases cellular retention of the Cu.

22177709|t|Amyloid beta peptide 1-42 disturbs intracellular calcium homeostasis through activation of GluN2B-containing N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors in cortical cultures.
22177709|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to debilitating cognitive deficits. Recent evidence demonstrates that glutamate receptors are dysregulated by amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) oligomers, resulting in disruption of glutamatergic synaptic transmission which parallels early cognitive deficits. Although it is well accepted that neuronal death in AD is related to disturbed intracellular Ca(2+) (Ca(2+)(i)) homeostasis, little is known about the contribution of NMDARs containing GluN2A or GluN2B subunits on Abeta-induced Ca(2+)(i) rise and neuronal dysfunction. Thus, the main goal of this work was to evaluate the role of NMDAR subunits in dysregulation of Ca(2+)(i) homeostasis induced by Abeta 1-42 preparation containing both oligomers (in higher percentage) and monomers in rat cerebral cortical neurons. The involvement of NMDARs was evaluated by pharmacological inhibition with MK-801 or the selective GluN2A and GLUN2B subunit antagonists NVP-AAM077 and ifenprodil, respectively. We show that Abeta, like NMDA, increase Ca(2+)(i) levels mainly through activation of NMDARs containing GluN2B subunits. Conversely, GluN2A-NMDARs antagonism potentiates Ca(2+)(i) rise induced by a high concentration of Abeta (1muM), suggesting that GluN2A and GluN2B subunits have opposite roles in regulating Ca(2+)(i) homeostasis. Moreover, Abeta modulate NMDA-induced responses and vice versa. Indeed, pre-exposure to Abeta (1muM) decrease NMDA-evoked Ca(2+)(I) rise and pre-exposure to NMDA decrease Abeta response. Interestingly, simultaneous addition of Abeta and NMDA potentiate Ca(2+)(I) levels, this effect being regulated by GluN2A and GluN2B subunits in opposite manners. This study contributes to the understanding of the molecular basis of early AD pathogenesis, by exploring the role of GluN2A and GluN2B subunits in the mechanism of Abeta toxicity in AD.

22178911|t|Development of a high-throughput screen targeting caspase-8-mediated cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein.
22178911|a|Caspases, effectors of apoptosis, are key mediators of neuronal death in several neurodegenerative diseases. Caspase-8 and caspase-6 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease (AD). ss-Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is cleaved at Asp664 in its intracellular domain by caspase-8. We and other laboratories recently showed that obliteration of the caspase cleavage site on APP alleviates functional AD-like deficits in a mouse model. Therefore, caspase cleavage of APP constitutes a potential novel target for therapeutic intervention. To identify chemical inhibitors of caspase-8 cleavage, we screened a subset of the chemical library at the Harvard NeuroDiscovery Center's Laboratory for Drug Discovery in Neurodegeneration. We show that caspase-8, but not caspase-1, -3, or -9, cleaves a biotinylated peptide derived from APP at Asp664, and we report the development of a sensitive high-throughput assay for caspase-8 cleavage of APP and the use of that assay for the identification of specific small molecule "hit" compounds that potently inhibit Asp664 cleavage of APP. Furthermore, we demonstrate that one of these compounds (LDN-0021835) inhibits the cleavage of APP at Asp664 in cell-based assays.

22178929|t|Ginsenoside Rg1 promotes nonamyloidgenic cleavage of APP via estrogen receptor signaling to MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt.
22178929|a|BACKGROUND: The pathogenic accumulation of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta), a natural occurring peptide processed from beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP), is considered to play a key role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Ginsenoside Rg1, an active component in ginseng, has been identified as a phytoestrogen and also found to be neuroprotective. However, it is unknown whether Rg1-induced estrogenic activity intervenes in APP processing, and improves memory performance. METHODS: Using HT22 cells and SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing the Swedish mutant APP (APPsw), this study investigated whether Rg1 intervened in APP metabolism through estrogenic activity. Using the ovariectomized (OVX) rats to mimic age-related changes in postmenopausal females, this study also tested the long-term effect of Rg1 on APP metabolism. RESULTS: The in vitro study demonstrated that Rg1 increased extracellular secretion of soluble amyloid precursor protein alpha (sAPPalpha), enhanced alpha-secretase activity and decreased extracellular release of Abeta. These effects of Rg1 could be prevented by inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC), Extracellular-Signal Regulated Kinase/Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (ERK/MAPK) and Phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways. Inhibition of endogenous estrogen receptor (ER) activity abrogated Rg1-triggered release of sAPPalpha, increase of alpha-secretase activity, and activation of ERK and Akt signaling. In addition, Rg1 promoted phosphorylation of ERalpha at Ser118 residue. The in vivo study demonstrated that 8-week Rg1 treatment of OVX rats increased sAPPalpha levels and decreased Abeta content in the hippocampi, and improved the spatial learning and memory. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Rg1 might be used to slow or prevent AD, in particular in postmenopausal females.

22179528|t|The role of APP proteolytic processing in lipid metabolism.
22179528|a|Amyloid plaques in brains are one of the major pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). These plaques are mainly formed by aggregated Abeta, generated by proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Therefore, APP processing and Abeta production have been one of the central scopes in AD research in the past. Now, accumulating evidence suggests that besides its pathological impact, APP and its cleavage products also contribute to physiological functions. Proteolytic cleavage of APP is tightly regulated, and several lipids such as cholesterol and sphingolipids have been shown to influence APP processing and Abeta generation. In turn, Abeta as well as other APP cleavage products plays an essential role in regulating lipid homeostasis arguing for complex regulatory cycles in which lipids control APP processing and vice versa. This balanced regulation is disrupted under pathological conditions such as in AD. This article will review the physiological function of APP and its proteolytic products, especially Abeta and AICD, in regulating lipid homeostasis and which lipid species modulate APP processing. Furthermore, we summarize the alterations in lipid metabolism observed in AD patients and AD mouse models.

22179788|t|The extracellular chaperone clusterin sequesters oligomeric forms of the amyloid-beta(1-40) peptide.
22179788|a|In recent genome-wide association studies, the extracellular chaperone protein, clusterin, has been identified as a newly-discovered risk factor in Alzheimer's disease. We have examined the interactions between human clusterin and the Alzheimer's disease-associated amyloid-beta(1-40) peptide (Abeta(1-40)), which is prone to aggregate into an ensemble of oligomeric intermediates implicated in both the proliferation of amyloid fibrils and in neuronal toxicity. Using highly sensitive single-molecule fluorescence methods, we have found that Abeta(1-40) forms a heterogeneous distribution of small oligomers (from dimers to 50-mers), all of which interact with clusterin to form long-lived, stable complexes. Consequently, clusterin is able to influence both the aggregation and disaggregation of Abeta(1-40) by sequestration of the Abeta oligomers. These results not only elucidate the protective role of clusterin but also provide a molecular basis for the genetic link between clusterin and Alzheimer's disease.

22182491|t|Differing modes of interaction between monomeric Abeta(1-40) peptides and model lipid membranes: an AFM study.
22182491|a|Membrane interactions with beta-amyloid peptides are implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease and cholesterol has been shown to be key modulator of this interaction, yet little is known about the mechanism of this interaction. Using atomic force microscopy, we investigated the interaction of monomeric Abeta(1-40) peptides with planar mica-supported bilayers composed of DOPC and DPPC containing varying concentrations of cholesterol. We show that below the bilayer melting temperature, Abeta monomers adsorb to, and assemble on, the surface of DPPC bilayers to form layers that grow laterally and normal to the bilayer plane. Above the bilayer melting temperature, we observe protofibril formation. In contrast, in DOPC bilayers, Abeta monomers exhibit a detergent-like action, forming defects in the bilayer structure. The kinetics of both modes of interaction significantly increases with increasing membrane cholesterol content. We conclude that the mode and rate of the interaction of Abeta monomers with lipid bilayers are strongly dependent on lipid composition, phase state and cholesterol content.

22182692|t|Targeting hyperphosphorylated tau with sodium selenate suppresses seizures in rodent models.
22182692|a|Tau hyperphosphorylation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of forms of human epilepsy. Here we investigated whether treatment with sodium selenate, a drug which reduces pathological hyperphosphorylated tau by enhancement of PP2A activity, would inhibit seizures in rodent models. In vitro, sodium selenate reduced tau phosphorylation in human neuroblastoma cells and reversed the increase in tau phosphorylation induced by the PP2A inhibitor, okadaic acid. Sodium selenate treatment was then tested against three different rodent seizure models. Firstly the propensity of 6-Hz electrical corneal stimulation to induce seizures in adult mice was assessed following acute treatment with different doses of sodium selenate. Secondly, the number of seizures induced by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) was quantified in rats following chronic sodium selenate treatment via drinking water. Finally, amygdala kindled rats were chronically treated with sodium selenate in drinking water and the length and the severity of the seizures evoked by stimulation of the amygdala recorded. The results demonstrated a dose-dependent protection of sodium selenate against 6-Hz stimulation induced seizures, and significant reduction in the total number of seizures following PTZ injection. Amygdala kindled rats chronically treated with sodium selenate had significantly shorter seizure duration compared controls, with more pronounced effects observed as the duration of treatment increased. The results of this study indicate that targeting hyperphosphorylated tau by treatment with sodium selenate has anti-seizure effects in a broad range of rodent models, and may represent a novel approach to treatment of patients with epilepsy.

22184106|t|Prolyl isomerase Pin1 promotes amyloid precursor protein (APP) turnover by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) activity: novel mechanism for Pin1 to protect against Alzheimer disease.
22184106|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of senile plaques of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP) and neurofibrillary tangles made of hyperphosphorylated Tau. Increasing APP gene dosage or expression has been shown to cause familial early-onset AD. However, whether and how protein stability of APP is regulated is unclear. The prolyl isomerase Pin1 and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) have been shown to have the opposite effects on APP processing and Tau hyperphosphorylation, relevant to the pathogenesis of AD. However, nothing is known about their relationship. In this study, we found that Pin1 binds to the pT330-P motif in GSK3beta to inhibit its kinase activity. Furthermore, Pin1 promotes protein turnover of APP by inhibiting GSK3beta activity. A point mutation either at Thr-330, the Pin1-binding site in GSK3beta, or at Thr-668, the GSK3beta phosphorylation site in APP, abolished the regulation of GSK3beta activity, Thr-668 phosphorylation, and APP stability by Pin1, resulting in reduced non-amyloidogenic APP processing and increased APP levels. These results uncover a novel role of Pin1 in inhibiting GSK3beta kinase activity to reduce APP protein levels, providing a previously unrecognized mechanism by which Pin1 protects against Alzheimer disease.

22184125|t|alpha-Secretase-derived fragment of cellular prion, N1, protects against monomeric and oligomeric amyloid beta (Abeta)-associated cell death.
22184125|a|In physiological conditions, both beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP) and cellular prion (PrP(c)) undergo similar disintegrin-mediated alpha-secretase cleavage yielding N-terminal secreted products referred to as soluble amyloid precursor protein-alpha (sAPPalpha) and N1, respectively. We recently demonstrated that N1 displays neuroprotective properties by reducing p53-dependent cell death both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we examined the potential of N1 as a neuroprotector against amyloid beta (Abeta)-mediated toxicity. We first show that both recombinant sAPPalpha and N1, but not its inactive parent fragment N2, reduce staurosporine-stimulated caspase-3 activation and TUNEL-positive cell death by lowering p53 promoter transactivation and activity in human cells. We demonstrate that N1 also lowers toxicity, cell death, and p53 pathway exacerbation triggered by Swedish mutated betaAPP overexpression in human cells. We designed a CHO cell line overexpressing the London mutated betaAPP (APP(LDN)) that yields Abeta oligomers. N1 protected primary cultured neurons against toxicity and cell death triggered by oligomer-enriched APP(LDN)-derived conditioned medium. Finally, we establish that N1 also protects neurons against oligomers extracted from Alzheimer disease-affected brain tissues. Overall, our data indicate that a cellular prion catabolite could interfere with Abeta-associated toxicity and that its production could be seen as a cellular protective mechanism aimed at compensating for an sAPPalpha deficit taking place at the early asymptomatic phase of Alzheimer disease.

22186967|a|We report the spontaneous dimerization process of the full-length Abeta42 proteins in water by using unguided, fully atomistic, explicit-water molecular dynamics simulations. Based on the thermodynamic analysis, we demonstrate that Abeta42 dimerization in water occurs via a two-step nucleation-accommodation mechanism driven by water-induced force and by protein internal force, respectively.

22188721|t|Critical role of cPLA2 in Abeta oligomer-induced neurodegeneration and memory deficit.
22188721|a|Soluble beta-amyloid (Abeta) oligomers are considered to putatively play a critical role in the early synapse loss and cognitive impairment observed in Alzheimer's disease. We previously demonstrated that Abeta oligomers activate cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)), which specifically releases arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids. We here observed that cPLA(2) gene inactivation prevented the alterations of cognitive abilities and the reduction of hippocampal synaptic markers levels noticed upon a single intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta oligomers in wild type mice. We further demonstrated that the Abeta oligomer-induced sphingomyelinase activation was suppressed and that phosphorylation of Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) was preserved in neuronal cells isolated from cPLA(2)(-/-) mice. Interestingly, expression of the Abeta precursor protein (APP) was reduced in hippocampus homogenates and neuronal cells from cPLA(2)(-/-) mice, but the relationship with the resistance of these mice to the Abeta oligomer toxicity requires further investigation. These results therefore show that cPLA(2) plays a key role in the Abeta oligomer-associated neurodegeneration, and as such represents a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

22189452|t|APOE modifies the association between Abeta load and cognition in cognitively normal older adults.
22189452|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between beta-amyloid (Abeta) load as measured by [(11)C]-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET and cognitive function in cognitively normal older adults. METHODS: We studied 408 cognitively normal older adults who participated in the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) from January 2009 through March 2011. The participants underwent PiB PET and neuropsychometric testing within 6 months. The association between PiB retention and cognitive function was measured by partial correlation and an interaction with APOE status was tested using linear regression after adjusting for age, sex, and education. RESULTS: Higher PiB retention was associated with cognitive performance (Spearman partial r = -0.18; p < 0.01), specifically the memory, language, attention/executive, and visual-spatial processing domains in the whole group of participants. The association between PiB retention and cognition was modified by the APOE status on linear regression analysis even after controlling for the differences in the distribution of PiB values among APOE epsilon4 carriers and noncarriers (p = 0.02). Cognitive performance was associated with the Abeta deposition in the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobe association cortices in APOE epsilon4 carriers on SPM analysis (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: There is a modest association between PiB retention and cognitive function in cognitively normal older adults and this relationship between Abeta load and cognitive function is modified by APOE status. Whereas Abeta load is associated with greater cognitive impairment in APOE epsilon4 carriers, the cognitive function in APOE epsilon4 noncarriers is influenced less by the Abeta load, suggesting that APOE isoforms modulate the harmful effects of Abeta on cognitive function.

22189983|t|Reevaluation of copper(I) affinity for amyloid-beta peptides by competition with ferrozine--an unusual copper(I) indicator.
22189983|a|The association constant of ferrozine (5,6-diphenyl-3-(2-pyridyl)-1,2,4-triazine-4,4''-disulfonic acid) with Cu(I) to form the chromophoric [Cu(I)(Fz)(2)](3-) complex was determined by UV/Vis titration experiments in Hepes buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4). An association constant close to 10(12) M(-2), which is significantly weaker than those of the well-known, water-soluble, Cu(I) chelators bicinchoninic acid and 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenantroline disulfonic acid, was found. The [Cu(I)(Fz)(2)](3-) chromophore was used in UV/Vis competition experiments to determine Cu(I) binding affinity for the amyloid-beta peptide involved in Alzheimer's disease and for a series of pertinent mutants. An association constant of approximately 10(7) M(-1) was found; this is much weaker than that reported for dithiothreitol and confirms that imidazoles are harder ligands than thiolates. Each His mutation (H6A, H13A, and H14A) impacts the peptide affinity for Cu(I). The native human amyloid-beta peptide was found to be a fourfold-stronger Cu(I) ligand than the murine peptide, which differs by three point mutations (R5G, Y10F, and H13R) from the human one.

22190361|t|Cerebral amyloid angiopathy in the elderly.
22190361|a|Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) results from deposition of beta-amyloid in the media and adventitia of small arteries and capillaries of the leptomeninges and cerebral cortex and is a major cause of lobar intracerebral hemorrhage and cognitive impairment in the elderly. CAA is associated with a high prevalence of magnetic resonance imaging markers of small vessel disease, including cerebral microbleeds and white matter hyperintensities. Although advanced CAA is present in approximately 1/4 of brains with Alzheimer disease (AD), fewer than half of CAA cases meet pathologic criteria for AD. This review will discuss the pathophysiology of CAA and focus on new imaging modalities and laboratory biomarkers that may aid in the clinical diagnosis of individuals with the disease.

22193058|a|Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) delivery to the brain of animals appears to be an emerging potential therapeutic approach to neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The intranasal route of administration could provide an alternative to intracerebroventricular infusion. A nasal spray of bFGF had been developed previously and the objective of the present study was to investigate whether bFGF nasal spray could enhance brain uptake of bFGF and ameliorate memory impairment induced by co-injection of beta-amyloid(25-35) and ibotenic acid into bilateral hippocampus of rats. The results of brain uptake study showed that the AUC(0-12h) of bFGF nasal spray in olfactory bulb, cerebrum, cerebellum and hippocampus was respectively 2.47, 2.38, 2.56 and 2.19 times that of intravenous bFGF solution, and 1.11, 1.95, 1.40 and 1.93 times that of intranasal bFGF solution, indicating that intranasal administration of bFGF nasal spray was an effective means of delivering bFGF to the brain, especially to cerebrum and hippocampus. In Morris water maze tasks, intravenous administration of bFGF solution at high dose (40 mug/kg) showed little improvement on spatial memory impairment. In contrast, bFGF solution of the same dose following intranasal administration could significantly ameliorate spatial memory impairment. bFGF nasal spray obviously improved spatial memory impairment even at a dose half (20 mug/kg) of bFGF solution, recovered their acetylcholinesterase and choline acetyltransferase activity to the sham control level, and alleviated neuronal degeneration in rat hippocampus, indicating neuroprotective effects on the central nerve system. In a word, bFGF nasal spray may be a new formulation of great potential for treating AD.

22197104|t|Environmental enrichment ameliorated high-fat diet-induced Abeta deposition and memory deficit in APP transgenic mice.
22197104|a|The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is tightly associated with metabolic dysfunctions. In particular, a potential link between type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and AD has been suggested epidemiologically, clinically, and experimentally, and some studies have suggested that exercise or dietary intervention reduces risk of cognitive decline. However, there is little solid molecular evidence for the effective intervention of metabolic dysfunctions for prevention of AD. In the present study, we established the AD model mice with diabetic conditions through high-fat diet (HFD) to examine the effect of environmental enrichment (EE) on HFD-induced AD pathophysiology. Here, we demonstrated that HFD markedly deteriorated memory impairment and increased beta-amyloid (Abeta) oligomers as well as Abeta deposition in amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice, which was reversed by exposure to an enriched environment for 10 weeks, despite the continuation of HFD. These studies provide solid evidence that EE is a useful intervention to ameliorate behavioral changes and AD pathology in HFD-induced aggravation of AD symptoms in APP transgenic mice.

22197298|t|Cognitive phenotyping of amyloid precursor protein transgenic J20 mice.
22197298|a|Transgenic mice that express familial Alzheimer's disease mutant forms of the human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) have proved to be invaluable in determining the impact that the neurotoxic amyloid-beta peptide has in vivo. In addition to the propensity to accumulate cerebral amyloid plaques, a crucial characteristic of hAPP mouse models is their cognitive impairments. To date the most widely used test for analyzing cognitive impairment in hAPP mice is the Morris water maze (MWM) which, due to the fact that mice are not "natural" swimmers, may not always be the ideal paradigm to investigate cognitive behaviours. Furthermore, not all cognitive impairments have been replicated across research laboratories. In the current study, we characterised the cognitive abilities of the J20 transgenic mouse line (expressing the Swedish 670/671(KM->NL) and Indiana (717(V->F)hAPP mutations) and non-transgenic mice. Mice were assessed in the cheeseboard task (i.e., a 'dry version' of the MWM) and a variety of other cognitive paradigms to test fear conditioning, object recognition and short-term memory to broaden the understanding of the cognitive deficits in J20 mice. hAPP transgenic mice perform normally in tasks for fear conditioning, short-term object recognition and short-term memory of context familiarity. However, they were profoundly impaired in their spatial reference memory capabilities in the cheeseboard task. The cheeseboard task has potential to replace the MWM task in situations where the MWM is not suitable for particular mouse models.

22197375|t|Structural basis of C-terminal beta-amyloid peptide binding by the antibody ponezumab for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
22197375|a|Alzheimer's disease, the most common cause of dementia in the elderly and characterized by the deposition and accumulation of plaques, is composed in part of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides, loss of neurons, and the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles. Here, we describe ponezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, and show how it binds specifically to the carboxyl (C)-terminus of Abeta40. Ponezumab can label Abeta that is deposited in brain parenchyma found in sections from Alzheimer's disease casualties and in transgenic mouse models that overexpress Abeta. Importantly, ponezumab does not label full-length, non-cleaved amyloid precursor protein on the cell surface. The C-terminal epitope of the soluble Abeta present in the circulation appears to be available for ponezumab binding because systemic administration of ponezumab greatly elevates plasma Abeta40 levels in a dose-dependent fashion after administration to a mouse model that overexpress human Abeta. Administration of ponezumab to transgenic mice also led to a dose-dependent reduction in hippocampal amyloid load. To further explore the nature of ponezumab binding to Abeta40, we determined the X-ray crystal structure of ponezumab in complex with Abeta40 and found that the Abeta40 carboxyl moiety makes extensive contacts with ponezumab. Furthermore, the structure-function analysis supported this critical requirement for carboxy group of AbetaV40 in the Abeta-ponezumab interaction. These findings provide novel structural insights into the in vivo conformation of the C-terminus of Abeta40 and the brain Abeta-lowering efficacy that we observed following administration of ponezumab in transgenic mouse models.

22198657|t|Trans fatty acids enhanced beta-amyloid induced oxidative stress in nerve growth factor differentiated PC12 cells.
22198657|a|The effects of trans fatty acids, elaidic acid (trans-9, C18:1) and linoelaidic acid (trans-9, trans-12 C18:2), at 20 or 40 muM in nerve growth factor differentiated PC12 cells with or without beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) were examined. Elaidic acid treatment alone did not affect cell viability and oxidative injury associated markers (P > 0.05). However, co-treatments of elaidic acid and Abeta led to more reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and Na+-K+-ATPase activity, and more increase in DNA fragmentation and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) production than Abeta treatment alone (P < 0.05). Linoelaidic acid alone exhibited apoptotic and oxidative effects in cells via decreasing MMP and Na+-K+-ATPase activity, increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, lowering glutathione content and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity (P < 0.05). The co-treatments of linoelaidic acid with Abeta further enhanced oxidative damage via enhancing the generation of ROS, nitrite oxide and 8-OHdG, elevating caspase-3, caspase-8 and nitric oxide synthase activities, as well as declining GPX, catalase and superoxide dismutase activities (P < 0.05). These results suggested that the interaction of linoelaidic acid and Abeta promoted oxidative stress and impaired mitochondrial functions in neuronal cells.

22198949|t|TLR2 is a primary receptor for Alzheimer's amyloid beta peptide to trigger neuroinflammatory activation.
22198949|a|Microglia activated by extracellularly deposited amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) act as a two-edged sword in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis: on the one hand, they damage neurons by releasing neurotoxic proinflammatory mediators (M1 activation); on the other hand, they protect neurons by triggering anti-inflammatory/neurotrophic M2 activation and by clearing Abeta via phagocytosis. TLRs are associated with Abeta-induced microglial inflammatory activation and Abeta internalization, but the mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we used real-time surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and conventional biochemical pull-down assays to demonstrate a direct interaction between TLR2 and the aggregated 42-aa form of human Abeta (Abeta42). TLR2 deficiency reduced Abeta42-triggered inflammatory activation but enhanced Abeta phagocytosis in cultured microglia and macrophages. By expressing TLR2 in HEK293 cells that do not endogenously express TLR2, we observed that TLR2 expression enabled HEK293 cells to respond to Abeta42. Through site-directed mutagenesis of tlr2 gene, we identified the amino acids EKKA (741-744) as a critical cytoplasmic domain for transduction of inflammatory signals. By coexpressing TLR1 or TLR6 in TLR2-transgenic HEK293 cells or silencing tlrs genes in RAW264.7 macrophages, we observed that TLR2-mediated Abeta42-triggered inflammatory activation was enhanced by TLR1 and suppressed by TLR6. Using bone marrow chimeric Alzheimer's amyloid precursor transgenic mice, we observed that TLR2 deficiency in microglia shifts M1- to M2-inflammatory activation in vivo, which was associated with improved neuronal function. Our study demonstrated that TLR2 is a primary receptor for Abeta to trigger neuroinflammatory activation and suggested that inhibition of TLR2 in microglia could be beneficial in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.

22200570|t|Effect of N-homocysteinylation on physicochemical and cytotoxic properties of amyloid beta-peptide.
22200570|a|Abstract Hyperhomocysteinemia has recently been identified as an important risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). One of the potential mechanisms underlying harmful effects of homocysteine (Hcy) is site-specific acylation of proteins at lysine residues by homocysteine thiolactone (HCTL). The accumulation of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) in the brain is a neuropathological hallmark of AD. In the present study we were interested to investigate the effects of N-homocysteinylation on the aggregation propensity and neurotoxicity of Abeta(1-42). By coupling several techniques, we demonstrated that the homocysteinylation of lysine residues increase the neurotoxicity of the Abeta peptide by stabilizing soluble oligomeric intermediates.

22200927|t|A new methodology for simultaneous quantification of total-Abeta, Abetax-38, Abetax-40, and Abetax-42 by column-switching LC/MS/MS.
22200927|a|This article details the development of a novel method that overcomes the drawbacks of sandwich ELISA (sELISA) and allows reliable evaluation of simultaneous quantification of the amyloid (Abeta)-peptides, total-Abeta, Abetax-38, Abetax-40, and Abetax-42, in rat brain by optimized sample purification and column-switching liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). This method provides accurate analyses of total-Abeta, Abetax-38, Abetax-40, and Abetax-42 with a linear calibration range between 0.05 and 45 ng/mL. Verification for accuracy and precision of biological samples were determined by a standard addition and recovery test, spiked with synthetic Abeta1-38, Abeta1-40, and Abeta1-42 into the rat brain homogenate. This method showed <20% relative error and relative standard deviation, indicating high reproducibility and reliability. The brain concentrations of total-Abeta, Abetax-38, Abetax-40, and Abetax-42 after oral administration of flurbiprofen in rats were measured by this method. Abetax-42 concentrations (4.57 +- 0.69 ng/g) in rats administered flurbiprofen were lower than those in untreated rats (6.48 +- 0.93 ng/g). This was consistent with several reports demonstrating that NSAIDs reduced the generation of Abeta. We report here a method that allows not only the quantification of specific molecular species of Abeta but also simultaneous quantification of total-Abeta, Abetax-38, Abetax-40, and Abetax-42, thus overcoming the drawbacks of sELISA.

22202667|t|Promotion of beta-amyloid production by C-reactive protein and its implications in the early pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
22202667|a|C-reactive protein (CRP) and beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) are involved in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the relationship between CRP and Abeta production is unclear. In vitro and in vivo experiments were performed to investigate the association of CRP with Abeta production. Using the rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cell line (PC12 cells) to mimic neurons, cytotoxicity was evaluated by cell viability and supernatant lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity. The levels of amyloid precursor protein (APP), beta-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE-1), and presenilins (PS-1 and PS-2) were investigated using real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting analysis. Abeta1-42 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The relevance of CRP and Abeta as well as potential mechanisms were studied using APP/PS1 transgenic (Tg) mice. Treatment with 0.5-4.0 muM CRP for 48 h decreased cell viability and increased LDH leakage in PC12 cells. Incubation with CRP at a sub-toxic concentration of 0.2 muM increased the mRNA levels of APP, BACE-1, PS-1, and PS-2, as well as Abeta1-42 production. CRP inhibitor reversed the CRP-induced upregulations of the mRNA levels of APP, BACE-1, PS-1, and PS-2, and the protein levels of APP, BACE-1, PS-1, and Abeta1-42, but did not reversed Abeta1-42 cytotoxicity. The cerebral levels of CRP and Abeta1-42 in APP/PS1 Tg mice were positively correlated, accompanied with the elevated mRNA expressions of serum amyloid P component (SAP), complement component 1q (C1q), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). These results suggest that CRP cytotoxicity is associated with Abeta formation and Abeta-related markers expressions; CRP and Abeta were relevant in early-stage AD; CRP may be an important trigger in AD pathogenesis.

22206845|t|A new neuronal target for beta-amyloid peptide in the rat hippocampus.
22206845|a|In Alzheimer's disease, amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) accumulation is associated with hippocampal network dysfunction. Intrahippocampal injections of Abeta induce aberrant inhibitory septohippocampal (SH) network activity in vivo and impairment of memory processing. In the present study, we observed, after hippocampal Abeta treatment, a selective loss of neurons projecting to the medial septum (MS) and containing calbindin (CB) and/or somatostatin (SOM). Other GABAergic neuronal subpopulations were not altered. Thus, the present study identifies hippocamposeptal neuron populations as specific targets for Abeta deposits. We observed that in Abeta-treated rats but not in controls, glutamate agonist application induced rhythmic bursting in 55% of the slow-firing neurons in the medial septum. This suggests that hippocampal Abeta can trigger modifications of the septohippocampal pathway via the alteration of a specific neuronal population. Long-range hippocamposeptal GABA/calbindin neurons, targets of hippocampal amyloid deposits, are implicated in supporting network synchronization. By identifying this target, we contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying deleterious effects of Abeta, one of the main agents of dementia in Alzheimer's disease.

22206846|t|Calpastatin modulates APP processing in the brains of beta-amyloid depositing but not wild-type mice.
22206846|a|We report that neuronal overexpression of the endogenous inhibitor of calpains, calpastatin (CAST), in a mouse model of human Alzheimer's disease (AD) beta-amyloidosis, the APP23 mouse, reduces beta-amyloid (Abeta) pathology and Abeta levels when comparing aged, double transgenic (tg) APP23/CAST with APP23 mice. Concurrent with Abeta plaque deposition, aged APP23/CAST mice show a decrease in the steady-state brain levels of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and APP C-terminal fragments (CTFs) when compared with APP23 mice. This CAST-dependent decrease in APP metabolite levels was not observed in single tg CAST mice expressing endogenous APP or in younger, Abeta plaque predepositing APP23/CAST mice. We also determined that the CAST-mediated inhibition of calpain activity in the brain is greater in the CAST mice with Abeta pathology than in non-APP tg mice, as demonstrated by a decrease in calpain-mediated cytoskeleton protein cleavage. Moreover, aged APP23/CAST mice have reduced extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activity and tau phosphorylation when compared with APP23 mice. In summary, in vivo calpain inhibition mediated by CAST transgene expression reduces Abeta pathology in APP23 mice, with our findings further suggesting that APP metabolism is modified by CAST overexpression as the mice develop Abeta pathology. Our results indicate that the calpain system in neurons is more responsive to CAST inhibition under conditions of Abeta pathology, suggesting that in the disease state neurons may be more sensitive to the therapeutic use of calpain inhibitors.

22206987|t|Sensitivity of amyloid formation by human islet amyloid polypeptide to mutations at residue 20.
22206987|a|Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP, amylin) is responsible for amyloid formation in type 2 diabetes and in islet cell transplants. The only known natural mutation found in mature human IAPP is a Ser20-to-Gly missense mutation, found with small frequency in Chinese and Japanese populations. The mutation appears to be associated with increased risk of early-onset type 2 diabetes. Early measurements in the presence of organic co-solvents showed that S20G-IAPP formed amyloid more quickly than the wild type. We confirm that the mutant accelerates amyloid formation under a range of conditions including in the absence of co-solvents. Ser20 adopts a normal backbone geometry, and the side chain makes no steric clashes in models of IAPP amyloid fibers, suggesting that the increased rate of amyloid formation by the mutant does not result from the relief of steric incompatibility in the fiber state. Transmission electronic microscopy, circular dichroism, and seeding studies were used to probe the structure of the resulting fibers. The S20G-IAPP peptide is toxic to cultured rat INS-1 (transformed rat insulinoma-1) beta-cells. The sensitivity of amyloid formation to the identity of residue 20 was exploited to design a variant that is much slower to aggregate and that inhibits amyloid formation by wild-type IAPP. An S20K mutant forms amyloid with an 18-fold longer lag phase in homogeneous solution. Thioflavin T binding assays, together with experiments using a p-cyanophenylalanine (p-cyanoPhe) variant of human IAPP, show that the designed S20K mutant inhibits amyloid formation by human IAPP. The experiments illustrate how p-cyanoPhe can be exploited to monitor amyloid formation even in the presence of other amyloidogenic proteins.

22209410|t|Impaired TrkB receptor signaling contributes to memory impairment in APP/PS1 mice.
22209410|a|Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an important role in neuronal plasticity, learning, and memory. Levels of BDNF and its main receptor TrkB (TrkB.TK) have been reported to be decreased while the levels of the truncated TrkB (TrkB.T1) are increased in Alzheimer's disease. We show here that incubation with amyloid-beta increased TrkB.T1 receptor levels and decreased TrkB.TK levels in primary neurons. In vivo, APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice (APdE9) showed an age-dependent relative increase in cortical but not hippocampal TrkB.T1 receptor levels compared with TrkB.TK. To investigate the role of TrkB isoforms in Alzheimer's disease, we crossed AP mice with mice overexpressing the truncated TrkB.T1 receptor (T1) or the full-length TrkB.TK isoform. Overexpression of TrkB.T1 in APdE9 mice exacerbated their spatial memory impairment while the overexpression of TrkB.TK alleviated it. These data suggest that amyloid-beta changes the ratio between TrkB isoforms in favor of the dominant-negative TrkB.T1 isoform both in vitro and in vivo and supports the role of BDNF signaling through TrkB in the pathophysiology and cognitive deficits of Alzheimer's disease.

22209725|t|The profile of beta-amyloid precursor protein expression of rats induced by aluminum.
22209725|a|The environmental agent aluminum has been extensively investigated for a potential relationship with amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression. Despite many investigations, there is at present no definite proof from which to draw a conclusion. Since APP is an integral membrane protein expressed in different tissues and capable of fluxes across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which may ultimately affect APP level in brain, it is necessary to assess the expression profile among vital body organs. The present study compared aluminum oxide and aluminum chloride injected rats with control rats (saline treated) to observe if aluminum affected APP expression patterns in different organs by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The expression of APP was observed in the brain of aluminum chloride treated rats and in the liver of aluminum oxide injected group. Results of double IHC staining showed that it is Kupffer cells, which are located in liver sinus and expressed APP after aluminum oxide treatment. Oxidative stress is suggested as the potential pathway that aluminum chloride exert effects in brain. These results suggest that different aluminum compounds may impact the expression of APP in brain and liver tissues. The mechanism that aluminum induced liver APP expression still needs further investigation.

22226742|t|Cortical surface mapping using topology correction, partial flattening and 3D shape context-based non-rigid registration for use in quantifying atrophy in Alzheimer's disease.
22226742|a|Magnetic resonance (MR) provides a non-invasive way to investigate changes in the brain resulting from aging or neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Performing accurate analysis for population studies is challenging because of the interindividual anatomical variability. A large set of tools is found to perform studies of brain anatomy and population analysis (FreeSurfer, SPM, FSL). In this paper we present a newly developed surface-based processing pipeline (MILXCTE) that allows accurate vertex-wise statistical comparisons of brain modifications, such as cortical thickness (CTE). The brain is first segmented into the three main tissues: white matter, gray matter and cerebrospinal fluid, after CTE is computed, a topology corrected mesh is generated. Partial inflation and non-rigid registration of cortical surfaces to a common space using shape context are then performed. Each of the steps was firstly validated using MR images from the OASIS database. We then applied the pipeline to a sample of individuals randomly selected from the AIBL study on AD and compared with FreeSurfer. For a population of 50 individuals we found correlation of cortical thickness in all the regions of the brain (average r=0.62 left and r=0.64 right hemispheres). We finally computed changes in atrophy in 32 AD patients and 81 healthy elderly individuals. Significant differences were found in regions known to be affected in AD. We demonstrated the validity of the method for use in clinical studies which provides an alternative to well established techniques to compare different imaging biomarkers for the study of neurodegenerative diseases.

22226743|t|Cisterna magna cannulated repeated CSF sampling rat model--effects of a gamma-secretase inhibitor on Abeta levels.
22226743|a|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) provides a window into central nervous system (CNS) physiology and pathophysiology in human neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Changes in CSF bioanalytes also provide a direct readout of target engagement in the CNS following pharmacological interventions in clinical trials. Given the importance of tracking CNS bioanalytes in drug discovery, we have developed a novel cisterna magna cannulated rat model for repeated CSF sampling and used it to assess an amyloid beta (Abeta) lowering agent. The surgically implanted cisterna magna cannula was patent over a period of 1-2 weeks and enabled repeated sampling of CSF (volume of ~30-50muL/sample) from each rat. CSF Abeta40 levels showed good intra-animal variability across time points and inter-animal variability within a time point. Peripheral treatment with a gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI) led to a rapid and robust decline in CSF Abeta40 levels that returned to baseline over 24-96h after dosing. Terminal brain, CSF and plasma Abeta levels measured at 24h after dosing demonstrated robust Abeta lowering and showed excellent correlation across these compartments. These results are the first pharmacological validation of the repeated CSF sampling rat model for Abeta lowering agents. This model can have broad applicability in pharmacological evaluation for diverse CNS targets.

22227054|t|Monitoring blood flow alterations in the Tg2576 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease by in vivo magnetic resonance angiography at 17.6 T.
22227054|a|Many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease are linked to abnormalities in the vascular system. In AD, the deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide in the cerebral vessel walls, known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is frequently observed, leading to blood flow abnormalities. Visualization of the changes in vascular structure is important for early diagnosis and treatment. Blood vessels can be imaged non-invasively by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). In this study we optimized high resolution MRA at 17.6 T to longitudinally monitor morphological changes in cerebral arteries in a Tg2576 mouse model, a widely used model of AD. Our results at 17.6 T show that MRA significantly benefits from the ultra-high magnetic field strength especially to visualize smaller vessels. Visual and quantitative analysis of MRA results revealed severe blood flow defects in large and medium sized arteries in Tg2576 mice. In particular blood flow defects were observed in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and in the anterior communicating artery (AComA) in Tg2576 mice. Histological data show that Abeta levels in the vessel wall may be responsible for impaired cerebral blood flow, thereby contributing to the early progression of AD. To our knowledge this is the first ultra-high field MRA study monitoring blood flow alterations longitudinally in living Tg2576 mice, consequently providing a powerful tool to test new therapeutic intervention related to CAA in a mouse model of AD.

22230888|t|Early brain amyloidosis in APP/PS1 mice with serum insulin-like growth factor-I deficiency.
22230888|a|The influence of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) on the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is discussed controversially. To help clarify the role of this circulating neurotrophic factor in brain amyloidosis, the major pathological trait in AD, we analyzed plaque formation in a mouse model of AD transgenic for human APP and PS1 mutations with reduced serum IGF-I levels (LIDAD mice). We found that brain amyloidosis in LIDAD mice appeared earlier than in AD mice, at 2 months of age, while attained comparable levels at 6 months. In parallel, early microgliosis was observed in LIDAD mice also at 2 months and remained exacerbated at 6 months. Collectively, these observations suggest a role of serum IGF-I in delaying early brain amyloidosis.

22510281|t|MicroRNA-153 negatively regulates the expression of amyloid precursor protein and amyloid precursor-like protein 2.
22510281|a|Increased expression of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a crucial risk factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2), a homologue of APP, is also suggested to participate in AD pathogenesis. Accumulating evidence suggest the regulatory role of microRNA on AD-related genes. Here we showed that the levels of miR-153 were significantly decreased at early- and late-stage of AD in APPswe/PSDeltaE9 murine model. Moreover, a binding site of miR-153 on APP and APLP2-3'UTR was identified, respectively, by luciferase assay. Gain and loss of function experiments demonstrated that miR-153 suppressed the expression of APP and APLP2. Using miR-153 transgenic mouse model, we testified that miR-153 downregulated the expression of APP and APLP2 protein in vivo. Furthermore, closely related expression patterns of miR-153 and APP/APLP2 during brain development indicated a physiological regulation role of miR-153 on the two genes. In a neuronal cell line treated with Abeta(42) peptides and H(2)O(2,) the levels of miR-153 varied during time-course leading to corresponding changes of APLP2 protein, indicating Abeta peptides and oxidative stress influence the expression of miR-153. Thus, miR-153 contributes to post-transcriptional regulation of APP/APLP2, suggesting a possible role for miR-153 in neuro-pathological conditions.

22778868|t|Molecular engineering of a secreted, highly homogeneous, and neurotoxic abeta dimer.
22778868|a|Abeta oligomers play a key role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. Research into structure-function relationships of Abeta oligomers has been hampered by the lack of large amounts of homogeneous and stable material. Using computational chemistry, we designed conservative cysteine substitutions in Abeta aiming at accelerating and stabilizing assembly of Abeta dimers by an intermolecular disulfide bond without changing its folding. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that mutants AbetaS8C and AbetaM35C exhibited structural properties similar to those of Abeta wildtype dimers. Full length, mutant APP was stably expressed in transfected cell lines to study assembly of Abeta oligomers in the physiological, secretory pathway and to avoid artifacts resulting from simultaneous in vitro oxidation and aggregation. Biochemical and neurophysiological analysis of supernatants indicated that AbetaS8C generated an exclusive, homogeneous, and neurotoxic dimer, whereas AbetaM35C assembled into dimers, tetramers, and higher oligomers. Thus, molecular engineering enabled generation of bioactive, homogeneous, and correctly processed Abeta dimers in vivo.

24900362|a|(18)F-labeled imidazo[2,1-b]benzothiazole ([(18)F]8) was synthesized and evaluated as a tracer for cerebral beta-amyloid deposits (Abeta) by means of positron emission tomography (PET). [(18)F]8 exhibits a high affinity to Abeta and suitable brain uptake kinetics combined with a high metabolic stability in the brain. In a double transgenic APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, we demonstrated a specific uptake of [(18)F]8 in Abeta-containing telencephalic brain regions. The specific binding of [(18)F]8 to Abeta was confirmed by regional brain biodistribution and autoradiography and correlated to immunohistochemistry staining. Analysis of brain sections of APP/PS1 mouse injected with a cocktail of [(18)F]8 and reference compound [(3)H]PiB revealed that the two tracers bind to Abeta plaques in the brain of mouse in a comparable binding pattern. [(18)F]8 represents the first high-contrast PET imaging agent for detection of Abeta plaques in transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and holds promise for transfer to a clinical evaluation.
