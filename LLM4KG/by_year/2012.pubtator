20359773|t|Val(8)GLP-1 rescues synaptic plasticity and reduces dense core plaques in APP/PS1 mice.
20359773|a|Diabetes is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. We tested the effects of Val(8)GLP-1, an enzyme-resistant analogue of the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 originally developed to treat diabetes in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease that expresses mutated amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin-1. We tested long term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic plasticity, inflammation response, and plaque formation. Val(8)GLP-1 crosses the blood-brain barrier when administered via intraperitoneal injection. Val(8)GLP-1 protected LTP in 9- and 18-month-old Alzheimer's disease mice when given for 3 weeks at 25 nmol/kg intraperitoneally. LTP was also enhanced in 18-month-old wild type mice, indicating that Val(8)GLP-1 also ameliorates age-related synaptic degenerative processes. Paired-pulse facilitation was also enhanced. The number of beta-amyloid plaques and microglia activation in the cortex increased with age but was not reduced by Val(8)GLP-1. In 18-month-old mice, however, the number of Congo red positive dense-core amyloid plaques was reduced. Treatment with Val(8)GLP-1 might prevent or delay neurodegenerative processes.

20382452|t|Specific domains in anterior pharynx-defective 1 determine its intramembrane interactions with nicastrin and presenilin.
20382452|a|gamma-Secretase, a multisubunit transmembrane protease comprised of presenilin, nicastrin, presenilin enhancer 2, and anterior pharynx-defective one, participates in the regulated intramembrane proteolysis of Type I membrane proteins including the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Although Aph-1 is thought to play a structural role in the assembly of gamma-secretase complex and several transmembrane domains (TMDs) of Aph-1 have been shown to be critical for its function, the importance of the other domains of Aph-1 remains elusive. We screened a series of Aph-1 mutants and focused on nine mutations distributed in six different TMDs of human APH-1aS, assessing their ability to complement mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking Aph-1. We showed that mutations in TMD4 (G126) and TMD5 (H171) of Aph-1aS prevented the formation of the Nct/Aph-1 subcomplex. Importantly, although mutations in TMD3 (Q83/E84/R85) and TMD6 (H197) of APH-1aS did not affect Nct/Aph-1 subcomplex formation, both mutations prevented further association/endoproteolysis of PS1. We propose a model that identifies critical TMDs of Aph-1 for associations with Nct and PS for the stepwise assembly of gamma-secretase components.

20417582|t|Cognition, glucose metabolism and amyloid burden in Alzheimer's disease.
20417582|a|The authors investigated relationships between glucose metabolism, amyloid load, and measures of cognitive and functional impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Patients meeting criteria for probable AD underwent (11)C-labeled Pittsburgh Compound-B ([(11)C]PIB) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and were assessed on a set of clinical measures. The Pittsburgh Compound-B (PIB) Distribution volume ratios and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) scans were spatially normalized and average PIB counts from regions-of-interest (ROI) were used to compute a measure of global PIB uptake. Separate voxel-wise regressions explored local and global relationships between metabolism, amyloid burden, and clinical measures. Regressions reflected cognitive domains assessed by individual measures, with visuospatial tests associated with more posterior metabolism, and language tests associated with metabolism in the left hemisphere. Correlating regional FDG uptake with these measures confirmed these findings. In contrast, no correlations were found between either voxel-wise or regional PIB uptake and any of the clinical measures. Finally, there were no associations between regional PIB and FDG uptake. We conclude that regional and global amyloid burden does not correlate with clinical status or glucose metabolism in AD.

20447733|t|BDNF increases with behavioral enrichment and an antioxidant diet in the aged dog.
20447733|a|The aged canine (dog) is an excellent model for investigating the neurobiological changes that underlie cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration in humans, as canines and humans undergo similar pathological and behavioral changes with aging. Recent evidence indicates that a combination of environmental enrichment and antioxidant-fortified diet can be used to reduce the rate of age-dependent neuropathology and cognitive decline in aged dogs, although the mechanisms underlying these changes have not been established. We examined the hypothesis that an increase in levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is one of the factors underlying improvements in learning and memory. Old, cognitively impaired animals that did not receive any treatment showed a significant decrease in BDNF mRNA in the temporal cortex when compared with the young group. Animals receiving either an antioxidant diet or environmental enrichment displayed intermediate levels of BDNF mRNA. However, dogs receiving both an antioxidant diet and environmental enrichment showed increased levels of BDNF mRNA when compared with untreated aged dogs, approaching levels measured in young animals. BDNF receptor TrkB mRNA levels did not differ between groups. BDNF mRNA levels were positively correlated with improved cognitive performance and inversely correlated with cortical Abeta((1-42)) and Abeta((1-40)) levels. These findings suggest that environmental enrichment and antioxidant diet interact to maintain brain levels of BDNF, which may lead to improved cognitive performance. This is the first demonstration in a higher animal that nonpharmacological changes in lifestyle in advanced age can upregulate BDNF to levels approaching those in the young brain.

20471717|t|Human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells improve neuropathology and cognitive impairment in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model through modulation of neuroinflammation.
20471717|a|Human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB-MSC) have a potential therapeutic role in the treatment of neurological disorders, but their current clinical usage and mechanism of action has yet to be ascertained in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we report that hUCB-MSC transplantation into amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin1 (PS1) double-transgenic mice significantly improved spatial learning and memory decline. Furthermore, amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) deposition, beta-secretase 1 (BACE-1) levels, and tau hyperphosphorylation were dramatically reduced in hUCB-MSC transplanted APP/PS1 mice. Interestingly, these effects were associated with reversal of disease-associated microglial neuroinflammation, as evidenced by decreased microglia-induced proinflammatory cytokines, elevated alternatively activated microglia, and increased anti-inflammatory cytokines. These findings lead us to suggest that hUCB-MSC produced their sustained neuroprotective effect by inducing a feed-forward loop involving alternative activation of microglial neuroinflammation, thereby ameliorating disease pathophysiology and reversing the cognitive decline associated with Abeta deposition in AD mice.

20580132|t|A PIN1 polymorphism that prevents its suppression by AP4 associates with delayed onset of Alzheimer's disease.
20580132|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is characterized by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles composed of tau and senile plaques of amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP). Pin1 is a unique prolyl isomerase that has been shown to protect against age-dependent neurodegeneration by acting on phosphorylated tau and APP to suppress tangle formation and amyloidogenic APP processing. Here we report a functional polymorphism, rs2287839, in the Pin1 promoter that is significantly associated with a 3-year delay in the average age at onset (AAO) of late-onset AD in a Chinese population. More significantly, the Pin1 polymorphism rs2287839 is located within the consensus binding motif for the brain-selective transcription factor, AP4 (CAGCTG) and almost completely abolishes the ability of AP4 to bind and suppress the Pin1 promoter, as shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and promoter luciferase assay. Moreover, overexpression or knockdown of AP4 resulted in an 80% reduction or 2-fold increase in endogenous Pin1 levels, respectively. Thus, AP4 is a novel transcriptional repressor of Pin1 expression and the Pin1 promoter single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) identified in this study that prevents such suppression is associated with delayed onset of AD. These results indicate that regulation of Pin1 by AP4 plays a critical role in determining age at onset of AD and might be a novel therapeutic target to delay the onset of AD.

20594620|t|Amyloid beta1-42 oligomer inhibits myelin sheet formation in vitro.
20594620|a|Accumulating evidence indicates that white matter degeneration contributes to the neural disconnections that underlie Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. Although this white matter degeneration is partly attributable to axonopathy associated with neuronal degeneration, amyloid beta (Abeta) protein-mediated damage to oligodendrocytes could be another mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we studied effects of soluble Abeta in oligomeric form on survival and differentiation of cells of the oligodendroglial lineage using highly purified oligodendroglial cultures from rats at different developmental stages. Abeta oligomer at 10 muM or higher reduced survival of mature oligodendrocytes, whereas oligodendroglial progenitor cells (OPCs) were relatively resistant to the Abeta oligomer-mediated cytotoxicity. Further study revealed that Abeta oligomer even at 1 muM accelerated 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) formazan exocytosis in mature oligodendrocytes, and, more significantly, inhibited myelin sheet formation after induction of in vitro differentiation of OPCs. These results imply a novel pathogenetic mechanism underlying Abeta oligomer-mediated white matter degeneration, which could impair myelin maintenance and remyelination by adult OPCs, resulting in accumulating damage to myelinating axons thereby contributing to neural disconnections.

20619502|t|MicroRNA-16 targets amyloid precursor protein to potentially modulate Alzheimer's-associated pathogenesis in SAMP8 mice.
20619502|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder mainly characterized by amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). The abnormal enrichment of amyloid protein precursor (APP) leads to a high risk of AD. One of the plausible age-associated AD animal models, senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8), have age-related learning and memory deficits. We found APP protein significantly increased in the hippocampus of aged SAMP8 mice. The 20 to 25 nucleotide (nt) tiny regulators, known as micro ribonucleic acids (miRNAs), have been found to play crucial roles in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we examined the post-transcriptional regulation mechanism of APP mediated by micro ribonucleic acids and found that miR-16 was one of the post-transcriptional regulators of APP in SAMP8 mice. Overexpression of miR-16, both in vitro and in vivo, led to reduced APP protein expression. Furthermore, miR-16 and APP displayed complementary expression patterns in SAMP8 mice and BALb/c mice embryos. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that APP is a target of miR-16 and the abnormally low expression of miR-16 could potentially lead to APP protein accumulation in AD mice.

20724034|t|Pro-oxidant diet enhances beta/gamma secretase-mediated APP processing in APP/PS1 transgenic mice.
20724034|a|The etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is complex with oxidative stress being a possible contributory factor to pathogenesis and disease progression. TASTPM transgenic mice expressing familial AD-associated amyloid precursor protein (APPswe) and presenilin transgenes (PS1M146V) show increased brain amyloid beta (Abeta) levels and Abeta plaques from 3 months. We tested if enhancing oxidative stress through diet would accelerate Abeta-related pathology. TASTPM were fed a pro-oxidant diet for 3 months resulting in increased brain levels of protein carbonyls, increased Nrf2, and elevated concentrations of glutathione (GSH). The diet increased both amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Abeta in the cortex of TASTPM but did not alter Abeta plaque load, presenilin 1, or beta-secretase (BACE1) expression. TASTPM cortical neurons were cultured under similar pro-oxidant conditions resulting in increased levels of APP and Abeta likely as a result of enhanced beta/gamma secretase processing of APP. Thus, pro-oxidant conditions increase APP levels and enhance BACE1-mediated APP processing and in doing so might contribute to pathogenesis in AD.

20961663|t|Characterization of 7- and 19-month-old Tg2576 mice using multimodal in vivo imaging: limitations as a translatable model of Alzheimer's disease.
20961663|a|With 90% of neuroscience clinical trials failing to see efficacy, there is a clear need for the development of disease biomarkers that can improve the ability to predict human Alzheimer's disease (AD) trial outcomes from animal studies. Several lines of evidence, including genetic susceptibility and disease studies, suggest the utility of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) as a potential biomarker with congruency between humans and animal models. For example, early in AD, patients present with decreased glucose metabolism in the entorhinal cortex and several regions of the brain associated with disease pathology and cognitive decline. While several of the commonly used AD mouse models fail to show all the hallmarks of the disease or the limbic to cortical trajectory, there has not been a systematic evaluation of imaging-derived biomarkers across animal models of AD, contrary to what has been achieved in recent years in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (Miller, 2009). If animal AD models were found to mimic endpoints that correlate with the disease onset, progression, and relapse, then the identification of such markers in animal models could afford the field a translational tool to help bridge the preclinical-clinical gap. Using a combination of FDG-PET and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined the Tg2576 mouse for global and regional measures of brain glucose metabolism at 7 and 19 months of age. In experiment 1 we observed that at younger ages, when some plaque burden and cognitive deficits have been reported, Tg2576 mice showed hypermetabolism as assessed with FDG-PET. This hypermetabolism decreased with age to levels similar to wild type (WT) counterparts such that the 19-month-old transgenic (Tg) mice did not differ from age matched WTs. In experiment 2, using cerebral blood volume (CBV) fMRI, we demonstrated that the hypermetabolism observed in Tg mice at 7 months could not be explained by changes in hemodynamic parameters as no differences were observed when compared with WTs. Taken together, these data identify brain hypermetabolism in Tg2576 mice which cannot be accounted for by changes in vascular compliance. Instead, the hypermetabolism may reflect a neuronal compensatory mechanism. Our data are discussed in the context of disease biomarker identification and target validation, suggesting little or no utility for translational based studies using Tg2576 mice.

21067847|t|Nanobody specific for oligomeric beta-amyloid stabilizes nontoxic form.
21067847|a|While accumulation and deposition of beta amyloid (Abeta) is a primary pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), increasing evidence has implicated small, soluble oligomeric aggregates of Abeta as the neurotoxic species in AD. Reagents that specifically recognize oligomeric morphologies of Abeta have potential diagnostic and therapeutic value. Using a novel biopanning technique that combines phage display technology and atomic force microscopy, we isolated the nanobody E1 against oligomeric Abeta. Here we show that E1 specifically recognizes a small oligomeric Abeta aggregate species distinct from the species recognized by the A4 nanobody previously reported by our group. While E1, like A4, blocks assembly of Abeta into larger oligomeric and fibrillar forms and prevents any Abeta induced toxicity toward neuronal cells, it does so by binding a small Abeta oligomeric species, directing its assembly toward a stable nontoxic conformation. The E1 nanobody selectively recognizes naturally occurring Abeta aggregates produced in human AD brain tissue indicating that a variety of morphologically distinct Abeta aggregate forms occur naturally and that a stable low-n nontoxic Abeta form exists that does not readily aggregate into larger forms. Because E1 catalyses the formation of a stable nontoxic low-n Abeta species it has potential value as a therapeutic reagent for AD which can be used in combination with other therapeutic approaches.

21159408|t|Prediction of conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease dementia based upon biomarkers and neuropsychological test performance.
21159408|a|The current study tested the accuracy of primary MRI and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker candidates and neuropsychological tests for predicting the conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. In a cross-validation paradigm, predictor models were estimated in the training set of AD (N = 81) and elderly control subjects (N = 101). A combination of CSF t-tau/Abeta(1-4) ratio and MRI biomarkers or neuropsychological tests (free recall and trail making test B (TMT-B)) showed the best statistical fit in the AD vs. HC comparison, reaching a classification accuracy of up to 64% when applied to the prediction of MCI conversion (3.3-year observation interval, mean = 2.3 years). However, several single-predictor models showed a predictive accuracy of MCI conversion comparable to that of any multipredictor model. The best single predictors were right entorhinal cortex (prediction accuracy = 68.5% (95% CI (59.5, 77.4))) and TMT-B test (prediction accuracy 64.6% (95% CI (55.5, 73.4%))). In conclusion, short-term conversion to AD is predicted by single marker models to a comparable degree as by multimarker models in amnestic MCI subjects.

21163551|t|Gray matter atrophy rate as a marker of disease progression in AD.
21163551|a|Global gray matter (GM) atrophy rates were quantified from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) over 6- and 12-month intervals in 37 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 19 controls using: (1) nonlinear registration and integration of Jacobian values, and (2) segmentation and subtraction of serial GM volumes. Sample sizes required to power treatment trials using global GM atrophy rate as an outcome measure were estimated and compared between the 2 techniques, and to global brain atrophy measures quantified using the boundary shift integral (brain boundary shift integral; BBSI) and structural image evaluation, using normalization, of atrophy (SIENA). Increased GM atrophy rates (approximately 2% per year) were observed in patients compared with controls. Although mean atrophy rates provided by Jacobian integration were smaller than those from segmentation and subtraction of GM volumes, measurement variance was reduced. The number of patients required per treatment arm to detect a 20% reduction in GM atrophy rate over a 12-month follow-up (90% power) was 202 (95% confidence interval [CI], 118-423) using Jacobian integration and 2047 (95% CI 271 to > 10,000) using segmentation and subtraction. Comparable sample sizes for whole brain atrophy were 240 (95% CI, 142-469) using the BBSI and 196 (95% CI, 110-425) using SIENA. Jacobian integration could be useful for measuring GM atrophy rate in Alzheimer's disease as a marker of disease progression and treatment efficacy.

21193246|t|Duplication of amyloid precursor protein (APP), but not prion protein (PRNP) gene is a significant cause of early onset dementia in a large UK series.
21193246|a|Amyloid precursor protein gene (APP) duplications have been identified in screens of selected probands with early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). A causal role for copy number variation (CNV) in the prion protein gene (PRNP) in prion dementias is not known. We aimed to determine the prevalence of copy number variation in APP and PRNP in a large referral series, test a screening method for detection of the same, and expand knowledge of clinical phenotype. We used a 3-tiered screening assay for APP and PRNP duplication (exonic real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction [exon-qPCR], fluorescent microsatellite quantitative PCR [fm-q-PCR], and Illumina array [Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA]) for analysis of a heterogeneous referral series comprising 1531 probands. Five of 1531 probands screened showed APP duplication, a similar prevalence to APP missense mutation. Real-time quantitative PCR and fluorescent microsatellite quantitative PCR were similar individually but are theoretically complementary; we used Illumina arrays as our reference assay. Two of 5 probands were from an autosomal dominant early onset Alzheimer's disease (familial Alzheimer's disease) pedigree. One extensive, noncontiguous duplication on chromosome 21 was consistent with an unbalanced translocation not including the Down's syndrome critical region. Seizures were prominent in the other typical APP duplications. A range of imaging, neuropsychological, cerebrospinal fluid, and pathological findings are reported that extend the known phenotype. APP but not PRNP duplication is a significant cause of early onset dementia in the UK. The recognized phenotype may be expanded to include the possibility of early seizures and apparently sporadic disease which, in part, may be due to different mutational mechanisms. The pros and cons of our screening method are discussed.

21196063|t|First transgenic rat model developing progressive cortical neurofibrillary tangles.
21196063|a|Neurofibrillary degeneration induced by misfolded protein tau is considered to be one of the key pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, we have introduced a novel transgenic rat model expressing a human truncated tau that encompasses 3 microtubule binding domains (3R) and a proline-rich region (3R tau151-391). The transgenic rats developed progressive age-dependent neurofibrillary degeneration in the cortical brain areas. Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) satisfied several key histological criteria used to identify neurofibrillary degeneration in human Alzheimer's disease including argyrophilia, Congo red birefringence, and Thioflavin S reactivity. Neurofibrillary tangles were also identified with antibodies used to detect pathologic tau in the human brain, including DC11, recognizing an abnormal tau conformation and antibodies that are specific for hyperphosphorylated forms of tau protein. Moreover, neurofibrillary degeneration was characterized by extensive formation of sarkosyl insoluble tau protein complexes consisting of rat endogenous and truncated tau species. Interestingly, the transgenic rats did not show neuronal loss either in the cortex or in the hippocampus. We suggest that novel transgenic rat model for human tauopathy represents a valuable tool in preclinical drug discovery targeting neurofibrillary degeneration of Alzheimer's type.

21199446|t|The upside of APP at synapses.
21199446|a|The memory dysfunctions that characterize Alzheimer's disease (AD) are strongly correlated with synapse loss. The amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its cleavage product Abeta play central roles in synapse and memory loss, and thus are strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. Numerous in vitro and transgenic AD mouse model studies have shown that overexpression of APP leads to Abeta accumulation, which causes decreased synaptic activity and dendritic spine density. However, the normal synaptic function of APP itself is not fully understood. Several recent studies have found that full-length APP promotes synaptic activity, synapse formation, and dendritic spine formation. These findings cast APP as a potential key player in learning and memory. It is of interest that the synaptic functions of full-length APP are opposite to the effects associated with pathological Abeta accumulation. In this review, we will summarize the normal functions of APP at synapses and spines along with other known functions of APP, including its role in cell motility, neuronal migration, and neurite outgrowth. These studies shed light on the physiological actions of APP, independent of Abeta effects, and thus lead to a better understanding of the synaptic dysfunctions associated with AD.

21199452|t|Clioquinol: review of its mechanisms of action and clinical uses in neurodegenerative disorders.
21199452|a|Clioquinol was produced as a topical antiseptic and marketed as an oral intestinal amebicide in 1934, being used to treat a wide range of intestinal diseases. In the early 1970s, it was withdrawn from the market as an oral agent because of its association with subacute myelo-optic neuropathy (SMON), a syndrome that involves sensory and motor disturbances in the lower limbs and visual changes. The first methods for determining plasma and tissue clioquinol (5-chloro-7-iodo-8-quinolinol) levels were set up in the 1970s and involved HPLC separation with UV detection, these were followed by a more sensitive GC method with electron capture detection and a gaschromatographic-massspectrometric (GC-MS) method. Finally, an HPLC method using electrochemical detection has proved to be as highly sensitive and specific as the GC-MS. In rats, mice, rabbits, and hamsters, clioquinol is rapidily absorbed and undergoes first-pass metabolization to glucuronate and sulfate conjugates; the concentrations of the metabolites are higher than those of free clioquinol. Bioavailabilty versus intraperitoneal dosing is about 12%. Dogs and monkeys form fewer conjugates. In man, single-dose concentrations are dose related, and the drug's half-life is 11-14 h. There is no accumulation, and the drug is much less metabolized to conjugates. Clioquinol acts as a zinc and copper chelator. Metal chelation is a potential therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) because zinc and copper are involved in the deposition and stabilization of amyloid plaques, and chelating agents can dissolve amyloid deposits in vitro and in vivo. In general, the ability of clioquinol to chelate and redistribute metals plays an important role in diseases characterised by Zn, Cu, Fe dyshomeostasis, such as AD and Parkinson's disease, as it reduces oxidation and the amyloid burden. Zinc chelators may also act as anticancer agents. Animal toxicity studies have revealed species-specific differences in neurotoxic responses that are related to the serum levels of clioquinol and metabolites. This is also true in humans, who form fewer conjugates. The results of studies of Alzheimer patients are conflicting and need further confirmation. The potential therapeutic role of the two main effects of MPACs (the regulation of the distribution of metals and antioxidants) has not yet been fully explored.

21257234|t|Combination therapy prevents amyloid-dependent and -independent structural changes.
21257234|a|Neuropathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are recapitulated in transgenic mice expressing familial AD-causing mutations, but ectopic transgene overexpression makes it difficult to relate these abnormalities to disease pathogenesis. Alternatively, the APP/PS-1 double knock-in (DKI) mouse produces mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin-1 (PS-1) with normal levels and regulatory controls. Here, we investigated effects of amyloid on brain structure and neuroplasticity by vaccinating DKI mice with amyloid-beta starting at 8 months of age. At 14 months, vaccination blocked cerebral amyloid deposition and its attendant microglial activation. Neuropil abnormalities were pronounced only within plaques, and included circumscribed loss and dysmorphology of axons, dendrites, terminals and spines. Blockade of amyloid deposition restored neuropil integrity. Amyloid removal did not rescue reductions in the hippocampal neural progenitor and neuroblast populations, but adding 1 month of voluntary exercise to amyloid-beta vaccination markedly stimulated hippocampal neurogenesis. These results identify amyloid-dependent and -independent structural changes in the DKI mouse model of AD. Combining exercise with amyloid-directed immunotherapy produces greater restoration of brain structure and neuroplasticity than is achieved with either maneuver alone.

21272962|t|Herpes simplex virus type I induces the accumulation of intracellular beta-amyloid in autophagic compartments and the inhibition of the non-amyloidogenic pathway in human neuroblastoma cells.
21272962|a|Mounting evidence suggests that herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Epidemiological analyses have shown that HSV-1 is a risk factor for AD in people with at least 1 type 4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene. Recent studies have also suggested that HSV-1 contributes to the appearance of the biochemical anomalies characteristic of AD brains. In addition, autophagic activity appears to be reduced with aging, and the final stages of autophagy in neurodegenerative process appear to be impaired. The present work reports that HSV-1 provokes the strong intracellular accumulation of both the main species of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in the autophagic compartments and that it is associated with a marked inhibition of Abeta secretion. Autophagosomes containing Abeta failed to fuse with lysosomes in HSV-1-infected cells, indicating the impaired degradation of Abeta localized in the autophagic vesicles. In addition, HSV-1 infection was associated with the inhibition of the nonamyloidogenic pathway of amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing without significantly affecting the activity of the secretases involved in the amyloidogenic pathway. Taken together, these data suggest that HSV-1 infection modulates autophagy and amyloid precursor protein processing, contributing to the accumulation of Abeta characteristic of AD.

21334099|t|Age and amyloid-related alterations in default network habituation to stimulus repetition.
21334099|a|The neural networks supporting encoding of new information are thought to decline with age, although mnemonic techniques such as repetition may enhance performance in older individuals. Accumulation of amyloid-beta, one hallmark pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), may contribute to functional alterations in memory networks measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) prior to onset of cognitive impairment. We investigated the effects of age and amyloid burden on fMRI activity in the default network and hippocampus during repetitive encoding. Older individuals, particularly those with high amyloid burden, demonstrated decreased task-induced deactivation in the posteromedial cortices during initial stimulus presentation and failed to modulate fMRI activity in response to repeated trials, whereas young subjects demonstrated a stepwise decrease in deactivation with repetition. The hippocampus demonstrated similar patterns across the groups, showing task-induced activity that decreased in response to repetition. These findings demonstrate that age and amyloid have dissociable functional effects on specific nodes within a distributed memory network, and suggest that functional brain changes may begin far in advance of symptomatic Alzheimer's disease.

21356140|t|Elevation of BACE in an Abeta rat model of Alzheimer's disease: exacerbation by chronic stress and prevention by nicotine.
21356140|a|In Alzheimer's disease (AD), progressive accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides impairs nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) function by a mechanism that may involve alpha7 and alpha4beta2-nAChR subtypes. Additionally, the beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP)-cleaving enzyme (BACE), the rate-limiting enzyme in the pathogenic Abeta production pathway, is expressed at high levels in hippocampal and cortical regions of AD brains. We measured hippocampal area CA1 protein levels of BACE and alpha7- and alpha4beta2-nAChR subunits using an Abeta rat model of AD (14-d osmotic pump i.c.v. infusion of 300 pmol/d Abeta peptides) in the presence and absence of chronic stress and/or chronic nicotine treatment. There was a significant increase in the levels of BACE in Abeta-infused rats, which were markedly intensified by chronic (4-6 wk) stress, but were normalized in Abeta rats chronically treated with nicotine (1 mg/kg b.i.d.). The levels of the three subunits alpha7, alpha4 and beta2 were significantly decreased in Abeta rats, but these were also normalized in Abeta rats chronically treated with nicotine. Chronic stress did not further aggravate the reduction of nAChRs in Abeta-infused rats. The increased BACE levels and decreased nAChR levels, which are established hallmarks of AD, provide additional support for the validity of the Abeta i.c.v.-infused rat as a model of AD.

21371785|t|Immunotherapy of cerebrovascular amyloidosis in a transgenic mouse model.
21371785|a|Cerebrovascular amyloidosis is caused by amyloid accumulation in walls of blood vessel walls leading to hemorrhagic stroke and cognitive impairment. Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) expression levels correlate with the degree of cerebrovascular amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and TGF-beta1 immunoreactivity in such cases is increased along the cerebral blood vessels. Here we show that a nasally administered proteosome-based adjuvant activates macrophages and decreases vascular amyloid in TGF-beta1 mice. Animals were nasally treated with a proteosome-based adjuvant on a weekly basis for 3 months beginning at age 13 months. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) we found that while control animals showed a significant cerebrovascular pathology, proteosome-based adjuvant prevents further brain damage and prevents pathological changes in the blood-brain barrier. Using an object recognition test and Y-maze, we found significant improvement in cognition in the treated group. Our findings support the potential use of a macrophage immunomodulator as a novel approach to reduce cerebrovascular amyloid, prevent microhemorrhage, and improve cognition.

21414686|t|Intracellular Abeta-oligomers and early inflammation in a model of Alzheimer's disease.
21414686|a|Lifelong use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been shown to diminish the incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD), suggesting a key role of inflammation in early stages of the pathology. While amyloid plaque-associated inflammation has been extensively studied in human and animal models, little is known about the inflammatory process prior to plaque deposition, i.e., in preclinical stages of AD. In this study we investigated microglial and neuronal inflammatory markers in preplaque transgenic McGill-Thy1-APP mice. We found evidence that prior to plaque deposition classical markers of microglial activation such as major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II), inducible nitric oxide synthase (i-NOS), and CD40 are already upregulated in the hippocampus of transgenic mice. Microglial cells from transgenic mice in the preplaque stage displayed intermediately activated morphology and appeared to be recruited toward intracellular amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta)-oligomer burdened neurons. The inducible, neuron-specific cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) enzyme was found to be upregulated and specifically expressed by neurons in close relationship with Abeta-bearing cells, at this early stage of the AD-like pathology. Our study suggests that neuroinflammation might be one of the earliest pathological responses to intracellular accumulation of Abeta-oligomers.

To investigate the predominant species of Abeta protein that may play a role in AD pathogenesis, we performed biochemical analysis of AD and control brains. Sucrose buffer-soluble brain lysates were characterized in native form using blue native (BN)-PAGE and also in denatured form using SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. BN-PAGE analysis revealed a high-molecular weight smear (>1000 kD) of Abeta(42) -positive material in the AD brain, whereas low-molecular weight and monomeric Abeta species were not detected. SDS-PAGE analysis, on the other hand, allowed the detection of prominent Abeta monomer and dimer bands in AD cases but not in controls. Immunoelectron microscopy of immunoprecipitated oligomers and protofibrils/fibrils showed spherical and protofibrillar Abeta-positive material, thereby confirming the presence of high-molecular weight Abeta (hiMWAbeta) aggregates in the AD brain. In vitro analysis of synthetic Abeta(40) - and Abeta(42)  preparations revealed Abeta fibrils, protofibrils, and hiMWAbeta oligomers that were detectable at the electron microscopic level and after BN-PAGE. Further, BN-PAGE analysis exhibited a monomer band and less prominent low-molecular weight Abeta (loMWAbeta) oligomers. In contrast, SDS-PAGE showed large amounts of loMWAbeta but no hiMWAbeta(40)  and strikingly reduced levels of hiMWAbeta(42) . These results indicate that hiMWAbeta aggregates, particularly Abeta(42)  species, are most prevalent in the soluble fraction of the AD brain. Thus, soluble hiMWAbeta aggregates may play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD either independently or as a reservoir for release of loMWAbeta oligomers.

21429624|t|Cognitive impairment and increased Abeta levels induced by paraquat exposure are attenuated by enhanced removal of mitochondrial H(2)O(2).
21429624|a|Pesticide exposure is a risk factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, little is known about how pesticide exposure may promote AD pathogenesis. In this study, we investigated the effects of paraquat pesticide exposure on beta-amyloid (Abeta) levels and cognition using wild-type (WT) mice and beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice. Our results showed that wild-type mice and APP transgenic mice after paraquat exposure had increased oxidative damage specifically in mitochondria of cerebral cortex and exhibited mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, the elevated mitochondrial damage was directly correlated with impaired associative learning and memory and increased Abeta levels in APP transgenic mice exposed to paraquat. Furthermore, overexpression of peroxiredoxin 3, a mitochondrial antioxidant defense enzyme important for H(2)O(2) removal, protected against paraquat-induced mitochondrial damage and concomitantly improved cognition and decreased Abeta levels in APP transgenic mice. Therefore, our results demonstrate that mitochondrial damage is a key mechanism underlying cognitive impairment and elevated amyloidogenesis induced by paraquat and that enhanced removal of mitochondrial H(2)O(2) could be an effective strategy to ameliorate AD pathogenesis induced by pesticide exposure.

21450370|t|Truncated tau and Abeta cooperatively impair mitochondria in primary neurons.
21450370|a|Mitochondrial dysfunction is likely a significant contributing factor to Alzheimer disease pathogenesis, and both amyloid peptide (Abeta) and pathological forms of tau may contribute to this impairment. Cleavage of tau at Asp421 occurs early in Alzheimer disease, and Asp421-cleaved tau likely negatively impacts neuronal function. Previously we showed that expression of Asp421-cleaved tau in a neuronal cell model resulted in mitochondrial impairment. To extend these findings we expressed either full length tau or Asp421-cleaved tau (truncated tau) in primary cortical neurons and measured different aspects of mitochondrial function with or without the addition of sublethal concentrations of Abeta. The expression of truncated tau alone induced significant mitochondrial fragmentation in neurons. When truncated tau expression was combined with Abeta at sublethal concentrations, increases in the stationary mitochondrial population and the levels of oxidative stress in cortical neurons were observed. Truncated tau expression also enhanced Abeta-induced mitochondrial potential loss in primary neurons. These new findings show that Asp421-cleaved tau and Abeta cooperate to impair mitochondria, which likely contributes to the neuronal dysfunction in Alzheimer disease.

21459473|t|The amyloid precursor protein and its homologues: structural and functional aspects of native and pathogenic oligomerization.
21459473|a|Over the last 25 years, remarkable progress has been made not only in identifying key molecules of Alzheimer's disease but also in understanding their meaning in the pathogenic state. One hallmark of Alzheimer pathology is the amyloid plaque. A major component of the extracellular deposit is the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide which is generated from its larger precursor molecule, i.e., the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by consecutive cleavages. Processing is exerted by two enzymes, i.e., the beta-secretase and the gamma-secretase. We and others have found that the self-association of the amyloid peptide and the dimerization and oligomerization of these proteins is a key factor under native and pathogenic conditions. In particular, the Abeta homodimer represents a nidus for plaque formation and a well defined therapeutic target. Further, dimerization of the APP was reported to increase generation of toxic Abeta whereas heterodimerization with its homologues amyloid precursor like proteins (APLP1 and APLP2) decreased Abeta formation. This review mainly focuses on structural features of the homophilic and heterophilic interactions among APP family proteins. The proposed contact sites are described and the consequences of protein dimerization on their functions and in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease are discussed.

21514693|t|Ovarian hormone loss induces bioenergetic deficits and mitochondrial beta-amyloid.
21514693|a|Previously, we demonstrated that reproductive senescence was associated with mitochondrial deficits comparable to those of female triple-transgenic Alzheimer's mice (3xTgAD). Herein, we investigated the impact of chronic ovarian hormone deprivation and 17beta-estradiol (E2) replacement on mitochondrial function in nontransgenic (nonTg) and 3xTgAD female mouse brain. Depletion of ovarian hormones by ovariectomy (OVX) in nontransgenic mice significantly decreased brain bioenergetics, and induced mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. In 3xTgAD mice, OVX significantly exacerbated mitochondrial dysfunction and induced mitochondrial beta-amyloid and beta-amyloid (Abeta)-binding-alcohol-dehydrogenase (ABAD) expression. Treatment with E2 at OVX prevented OVX-induced mitochondrial deficits, sustained mitochondrial bioenergetic function, decreased oxidative stress, and prevented mitochondrial beta-amyloid and ABAD accumulation. In vitro, E2 increased maximal mitochondrial respiration in neurons and basal and maximal respiration in glia. Collectively, these data demonstrate that ovarian hormone loss induced a mitochondrial phenotype comparable to a transgenic female model of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which was prevented by E2. These findings provide a plausible mechanism for increased risk of Alzheimer's disease in premenopausally oophorectomized women while also suggesting a therapeutic strategy for prevention.

21531045|t|Gadolinium-staining reveals amyloid plaques in the brain of Alzheimer's transgenic mice.
21531045|a|Detection of amyloid plaques in the brain by in vivo neuroimaging is a very promising biomarker approach for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and evaluation of therapeutic efficacy. Here we describe a new method to detect amyloid plaques by in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based on the intracerebroventricular injection of a nontargeted gadolinium (Gd)-based contrast agent, which rapidly diffuses throughout the brain and increases the signal and contrast of magnetic resonance (MR) images by shortening the T1 relaxation time. This gain in image sensitivity after in vitro and in vivo Gd staining significantly improves the detection and resolution of individual amyloid plaques in the cortex and hippocampus of AD transgenic mice. The improved image resolution is sensitive enough to demonstrate an age-dependent increase of amyloid plaque load and a good correlation between the amyloid load measured by muMRI and histology. These results provide the first demonstration that nontargeted Gd staining can enhance the detection of amyloid plaques to follow the progression of AD and to evaluate the activity of amyloid-lowering therapeutic strategies in longitudinal studies.

21538458|t|Applications of mass spectrometry to metabolomics and metabonomics: detection of biomarkers of aging and of age-related diseases.
21538458|a|Every 5 years or so new technologies, or new combinations of old ones, seemingly burst onto the science scene and are then sought after until they reach the point of becoming commonplace. Advances in mass spectrometry instrumentation, coupled with the establishment of standardized chemical fragmentation libraries, increased computing power, novel data-analysis algorithms, new scientific applications, and commercial prospects have made mass spectrometry-based metabolomics the latest sought-after technology. This methodology affords the ability to dynamically catalogue and quantify, in parallel, femtomole quantities of cellular metabolites. The study of aging, and the diseases that accompany it, has accelerated significantly in the last decade. Mutant genes that alter the rate of aging have been found that increase lifespan by up to 10-fold in some model organisms, and substantial progress has been made in understanding fundamental alterations that occur at both the mRNA and protein level in tissues of aging organisms. The application of metabolomics to aging research is still relatively new, but has already added significant insight into the aging process. In this review we summarize these findings. We have targeted our manuscript to two audiences: mass spectrometrists interested in applying their technical knowledge to unanswered questions in the aging field, and gerontologists interested in expanding their knowledge of both mass spectrometry and the most recent advances in aging-related metabolomics.

21538702|t|Attention-related networks in Alzheimer's disease: a resting functional MRI study.
21538702|a|In addition to memory deficits, attentional impairment is a common manifestation of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present study examines the abnormalities of attention-related functional networks in AD using resting functional MRI (fMRI) technique and evaluates the sensitivity and specificity of these networks as potential biomarkers compared with the default mode network (DMN). Group independent component analysis (Group ICA) was applied to fMRI data from 15 AD patients and 16 normal healthy elderly controls (NC) to derive the dorsal attention network (DAN) and the ventral attention network (VAN) which are respectively responsible for the endogenous attention orienting ("top-down") process and the exogenous attention re-orienting ("bottom-up") process. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed for activity in core regions within each of these networks. Functional connectivity analysis revealed disrupted DAN and preserved (less impaired) VAN in AD patients compared with NC, which might indicate impairment of a "top-down" and intact "bottom-up" attentional processing mechanisms in AD. ROC curve analysis suggested that activity in the left intraparietal sulcus and left frontal eye field from DAN as well as the posterior cingulate cortex from the DMN could serve as sensitive and specific biomarkers distinguishing AD from NC.

21544098|t|Serum amyloid P component facilitates DNA clearance and inhibits plasmid transfection: implications for human DNA vaccine.
21544098|a|The demonstration that naked plasmid DNA can induce strong immune responses in mice has attracted considerable attention in the vaccine community. However, similar immunizations have been less/not effective in clinical trials during the past decade, and the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we hypothesized that some DNA-binding proteins in human serum may serve as host barriers, responsible for the low efficiency of plasmids' transfection in vivo. Using proteomics, we showed that human serum amyloid P component (hSAP) is specifically present in human DNA-protein complexes. Further analysis indicated that hSAP effectively binds plasmid DNA, inhibits DNA transfection into somatic cells and facilitates the endocytosis of DNA by macrophages, whereas mouse SAP (mSAP) has similar, but much weaker, activities. In the presence of hSAP, the plasmid DNA expression in vivo and plasmid DNA-induced immune responses also significantly decreased. Therefore, our results suggest that hSAP contributes to extracellular DNA clearance and the inhibition of plasmid DNA transfection in vivo. This mechanism may be partly responsible for the insufficient immune responses to DNA vaccination in human beings; therefore, it may serve as a novel target for the improvement of DNA vaccines and DNA-based gene therapy.

21546126|t|An amyloid beta42-dependent deficit in anandamide mobilization is associated with cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.
21546126|a|The endocannabinoids and their attending cannabinoid (CB)(1) receptors have been implicated in the control of cognition, but their possible roles in dementias are still unclear. In the present study, we used liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry to conduct an endocannabinoid-targeted lipidomic analysis of postmortem brain samples from 38 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and 17 control subjects, matched for age and postmortem interval. The analysis revealed that midfrontal and temporal cortex tissue from AD patients contains, relative to control subjects, significantly lower levels of the endocannabinoid anandamide and its precursor 1-stearoyl, 2-docosahexaenoyl-sn-glycero-phosphoethanolamine-N-arachidonoyl (NArPE). No such difference was observed with the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol or 15 additional lipid species. In AD patients, but not in control subjects, statistically detectable positive correlations were found between (1) anandamide content in midfrontal cortex and scores of the Kendrick's Digit Copy test (p = 0.004, r = 0.81; n = 10), which measures speed of information processing; and (2) anandamide content in temporal cortex and scores of the Boston Naming test (p = 0.027, r = 0.52; n = 18), which assesses language facility. Furthermore, anandamide and NArPE levels in midfrontal cortex of the study subjects inversely correlated with levels of the neurotoxic amyloid peptide, amyloid beta-protein (Abeta)(42), while showing no association with Abeta(40) levels, amyloid plaque load or tau protein phosphorylation. Finally, high endogenous levels of Abeta(42) in Swedish mutant form of amyloid precursor protein (APP(SWE))/Neuro-2a cells directly reduced anandamide and NArPE concentrations in cells lysates. The results suggest that an Abeta(42)-dependent impairment in brain anandamide mobilization contributes to cognitive dysfunction in AD.

21567509|t|An aqueous extract of Withania somnifera root inhibits amyloid beta fibril formation in vitro.
21567509|a|The ability of an aqueous extract of W. somnifera L. Dunal (Family: Solanaceae) roots to inhibit fibril formation by the amyloid-beta peptide in vitro was investigated. W. somnifera is used extensively in traditional Ayurvedic medicine as a nerve tonic with reputed memory enhancing properties. Inhibition of fibrillogenesis measured by transmission electron microscopy and ThT fluorescence assay showed that an aqueous extract of W. somnifera strongly inhibited Abeta fibril formation in a concentration-dependent manner, when compared with control samples. These results suggest that the aqueous extract of W. somnifera root has an ability to inhibit the formation of mature amyloid-beta fibrils in vitro, which are known to lead to amyloid plaque formation in vivo.

21642811|t|Recognition memory and beta-amyloid plaques in adult Tg2576 mice are not modified after oral exposure to aluminum.
21642811|a|The role of aluminum (Al) in Alzheimer disease is highly controversial. However, this element has been detected in neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in patients with Alzheimer disease. Its presence in neuritic plaques in hippocampus is especially relevant, as this is an area closely related to spatial learning and memory. In this study, the diet of wild-type and Tg2576 mice (animals overexpressing the human amyloid precursor protein) was supplemented with Al lactate (1 mg/g). General neurotoxic Al effects were evaluated using a functional observational battery and a novel object recognition task. Four experimental groups were used: Control-wild, Al-wild, Control-Tg, and Al-Tg mice. The results show a decreased home-cage activity and an increase in piloerection in all Al-exposed animals, and an increased sensorimotor reactivity in Tg2576 mice given Al. Neither Al treatment nor genotype had any noticeable effect on corticosterone levels and Al concentrations in frontal cortex and cerebellum of the mice. Recognition memory was impaired in Tg2576 mice, whereas beta-amyloid plaque depositions were observed in all these animals. However, Al did not alter the recognition memory and beta-amyloid plaque loads of Tg2576 mice.

21645162|t|Mechanism of PrP-amyloid formation in mice without transmissible spongiform encephalopathy.
21645162|a|Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker (GSS) P102L disease is a familial form of a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) that can present with or without vacuolation of neuropil. Inefficient disease transmission into 101LL transgenic mice was previously observed from GSS P102L without vacuolation. However, several aged, healthy mice had large plaques composed of abnormal prion protein (PrP(d)). Here we perform the ultrastructural characterization of such plaques and compare them with PrP(d) aggregates found in TSE caused by an infectious mechanism. PrP(d) plaques in 101LL mice varied in maturity, with some being composed of deposits without visible amyloid fibrils. PrP(d) was present on cell membranes in the vicinity of all types of plaques. In contrast to the unicentric plaques seen in infectious murine scrapie, the plaques seen in the current model were multicentric and were initiated by protofibrillar forms of PrP(d) situated on oligodendroglia, astrocytes and neuritic cell membranes. We speculate that the initial conversion process leading to plaque formation begins with membrane-bound PrP(C) but that subsequent fibrillization does not require membrane attachment. We also observed that the membrane alterations consistently seen in murine scrapie and other infectious TSEs were not present in 101LL mice with plaques, suggesting differences in the pathogenesis of these conditions.

21679929|t|Regional expansion of hypometabolism in Alzheimer's disease follows amyloid deposition with temporal delay.
21679929|a|BACKGROUND: Cross-sectional imaging studies suggest that patterns of hypometabolism (measured by [(18)F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography [FDG-PET]) and amyloid deposition (measured by [(11)C] Pittsburgh Compound B [PiB]- PET) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) show some overlap with each other. This indicates that neuronal dysfunction might spread within the anatomical pattern of amyloid deposition. The aim of this study was to examine longitudinal regional patterns of amyloid deposition and hypometabolism in the same population of mild AD subjects and to establish their regional relationship to each other. METHODS: Twenty patients with mild AD underwent baseline (BL) and follow-up (FU) examination with [(18)F] FDG-PET and [(11)C] PiB-PET. Voxel-by-voxel statistical group comparison (SPM5) was performed between patient BL- and FU-PET data as well as between patients and 15 PiB-negative elderly control subjects, who had undergone identical imaging procedures. To obtain objective measures of regional overlap, Dice similarity coefficients (DSC) between the imaging findings were calculated. RESULTS: Compared with elderly control subjects, AD patients showed typical patterns of BL hypometabolism and BL amyloid deposition, with a similarity of 40% (DSC). Amyloid deposition was more extended than hypometabolism at BL and showed only minor changes over time, whereas significant expansion of hypometabolism was observed, almost exclusively within areas already affected by BL amyloid deposition. Thus, increased similarity of FU hypometabolism with BL amyloid deposition was found (DSC: 47%). CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal regional expansion of cerebral hypometabolism, as a measure of neuronal dysfunction in AD, seems to follow the anatomical pattern of amyloid deposition with temporal delay. This indicates that amyloid-based disruption of neuronal integrity might contribute to the regional expansion of neuronal dysfunction.

21681821|t|Liver-specific overexpression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) in transgenic mice accelerates development of hepatocellular carcinoma.
21681821|a|Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) plays a central role in tumor invasion and development of metastases. Expression of MMP-9 had been shown in human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). However, it remained unclear whether MMP-9 could influence development of HCC. In order to address this issue, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing MMP-9 in the liver. In order to avoid embryonic lethality a Cre-lox system was utilized for conditional overexpression of MMP-9 under control of an albumin enhancer and promoter. Induction of MMP-9 overexpression in transgenic mice was achieved by i.v. injection of an adenovirus coding for the Cre recombinase. Initiation of liver carcinogenesis was achieved by injection of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) followed by Phenobarbital administration in drinking water. Transgene expression was induced at the age of 6 wk. Four and six months later mice were sacrificed and examined macroscopically and microscopically in a blinded manner. Alb/Cre/MMP-9-transgenic mice showed liver specific overexpression of MMP-9-mRNA and protein after induction. At the age of 6 months livers of transgenic mice showed 15.7 +- 11.6 tumors (mean +- SD) in contrast to wildtype mice with only 7.9 +- 11.0 tumors (P < 0.03). By histopathology examination of the livers HCCs were identified in 42% of the transgenic mouse livers but only 8% in wildtype animals. In summary, we established a novel MMP-9 transgenic mouse model, and report on a significantly increased susceptibility of MMP-9 transgenic mice to chemically induced carcinogenesis. This is the first in vivo proof that MMP-9 overexpression promotes liver tumor development.

21683475|t|Different beta-amyloid oligomer assemblies in Alzheimer brains correlate with age of disease onset and impaired cholinergic activity.
21683475|a|In this study, we examined the relationship between various beta-amyloid (Abeta) oligomer assemblies in autopsy brain with the levels of fibrillar Abeta and cholinergic synaptic function. Brain tissues obtained from the frontal cortex of 14 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients grouped into early-onset AD (EOAD) and late-onset AD (LOAD) and 12 age-matched control subjects were used to extract and quantify Abeta oligomers in soluble (TBS), detergent soluble (TBST), and insoluble (GuHCl) fractions. The predominant oligomeric Abeta assemblies detected were dodecamers, decamers, and pentamers, and different patterns of expression were observed between EOAD and LOAD patients. There was no association between any of the detected Abeta oligomer assemblies and fibrillar Abeta levels measured by N-methyl[(3)H] 2-(40-methylaminophenyl)-6-hydroxy-benzothiazole ([(3)H]PIB) binding. Levels of pentamers in the soluble fraction significantly correlated with a reduction in choline acetyltransferase activity in AD patients. The number of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors negatively correlated with the total amount of Abeta oligomers in the insoluble fraction in EOAD patients, and with decamers in the soluble fraction in LOAD patients. These novel findings suggest that distinct Abeta oligomers induce impairment of cholinergic neurotransmission in AD pathogenesis.

21691800|t|Selective interaction of amyloid precursor protein with different isoforms of neural cell adhesion molecule.
21691800|a|Compare to the thoroughly studied beta-amyloid, the physiological function of amyloid precursor protein (APP) is not well understood. We now had identified neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM)-140 as a potential interaction partner of APP. Our data indicated that NCAM-140, but not NCAM-180, binds to the conserved central extracellular domain of APP. We also found that the phosphorylation levels of ERK1 and ERK2 were increased when cells were co-transfected with NCAM-140 and APP indicate that the interaction between NCAM-140 and APP may involve the MAPK pathway. These findings demonstrated that NCAM-140 interacts with APP, potentially playing a role in neurite outgrowth and neural development.

21699461|a|Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) was purified on DEAE-Sepharose anion-exchange in a 38% yield, with 3-fold recovery and specific activity of 5 micromol.min(-1).mg(-1). The enzyme was a heterogeneous dimer of molecular mass 225 kDa having a temperature and pH optima of 40 C and 6.5, K(m) and V(max) of 2.6 muM and 996 nmol.min(-1).ml(-1), respectively and was relatively stable at the optimum conditions (t(1/2) = 3 h). beta-Amyloid peptide fragments Abeta(17-28) was the better inhibitor for nNOS (K(i) = 0.81 microM). After extended incubation of nNOS (96 h) with each of the peptide fragments, Congo Red, turbidity and thioflavin-T assays detected the presence of soluble and insoluble fibrils that had formed at a rate of 5 nM.min(-1). A hydrophobic fragment Abeta(17-21) [Leu(17) - Val(18) - Phe(19) - Phe(20) - Ala(21)] and glycine zipper motifs within the peptide fragment Abeta(17-35) were critical in binding and in fibrillogenesis confirming that nNOS was amyloidogenic catalyst.

21704433|t|Amyloid beta-induced ER stress is enhanced under mitochondrial dysfunction conditions.
21704433|a|Previously we reported that endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria crosstalk is involved in amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced apoptosis. Now we show that mitochondrial dysfunction affects the ER stress response triggered by Abeta using cybrids that recreate the defect in mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity detected in platelets from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. AD and control cybrids were treated with Abeta or classical ER stressors and the ER stress-mediated apoptotic cell death pathway was accessed. Upon treatment, we found increased glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) levels and caspase-4 activation (ER stress markers) which were more pronounced in AD cybrids. Treated AD cybrids also exhibited decreased cell survival as well as increased caspase-3-like activity, poli-ADP-ribose-polymerase (PARP) levels and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive apoptotic cells. Finally, we showed that Abeta-induced caspase-3 activation in both cybrid cell lines was prevented by dantrolene, thus implicating ER Ca(2+) release in ER stress-mediated apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction occurring in AD patients due to COX inhibition potentiates cell susceptibility to Abeta-induced ER stress. This study further supports the close communication between ER and mitochondria during apoptosis in AD.

21712514|t|Beta amyloid deposition and neurofibrillary tangles spontaneously occur in the brains of captive cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus).
21712514|a|Alzheimer disease is a dementing disorder characterized pathologically by Abeta deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal loss. Although aged animals of many species spontaneously develop Abeta deposits, only 2 species (chimpanzee and wolverine) have been reported to develop Abeta deposits and neurofibrillary tangles in the same individual. Here, the authors demonstrate the spontaneous occurrence of Abeta deposits and neurofibrillary tangles in captive cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus). Among 22 cheetahs examined in this study, Abeta deposits were observed in 13. Immunostaining (AT8) revealed abnormal intracellular tau immunoreactivity in 10 of the cheetahs with Abeta deposits, and they were mainly distributed in the parahippocampal cortex and CA1 in a fashion similar to that in human patients with Alzheimer disease. Ultrastructurally, bundles of straight filaments filled the neuronal somata and axons, consistent with tangles. Interestingly, 2 of the cheetahs with the most severe abnormal tau immunoreactivity showed clinical cognitive dysfunction. The authors conclude that cheetahs spontaneously develop age-related neurodegenerative disease with pathologic changes similar to Alzheimer disease.

21714827|t|Widespread tau and amyloid-beta pathology many years after a single traumatic brain injury in humans.
21714827|a|While a history of a single traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with the later development of syndromes of cognitive impairment such as Alzheimer's disease, the long-term pathology evolving after single TBI is poorly understood. However, a progressive tauopathy, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, is described in selected cohorts with a history of repetitive concussive/mild head injury. Here, post-mortem brains from long-term survivors of just a single TBI (1-47 years survival; n=39) vs. uninjured, age-matched controls (n=47) were examined for neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques using immunohistochemistry and thioflavine-S staining. Detailed maps of findings permitted classification of pathology using semiquantitative scoring systems. NFTs were exceptionally rare in young, uninjured controls, yet were abundant and widely distributed in approximately one-third of TBI cases. In addition, Abeta-plaques were found in a greater density following TBI vs. controls. Moreover, thioflavine-S staining revealed that while all plaque-positive control cases displayed predominantly diffuse plaques, 64% of plaque-positive TBI cases displayed predominantly thioflavine-S-positive plaques or a mixed thioflavine-S-positive/diffuse pattern. These data demonstrate that widespread NFT and Abeta plaque pathologies are present in up to a third of patients following survival of a year or more from a single TBI. This suggests that a single TBI induces long-term neuropathological changes akin to those found in neurodegenerative disease.

21720722|t|Target gene repression mediated by miRNAs miR-181c and miR-9 both of which are down-regulated by amyloid-beta.
21720722|a|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA regulators of protein synthesis that are essential for normal brain development and function. Their profiles are significantly altered in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) that is characterized by amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau deposition in brain. How deregulated miRNAs contribute to AD is not understood, as their dysfunction could be both a cause and a consequence of disease. To address this question we had previously profiled miRNAs in models of AD. This identified miR-9 and -181c as being down-regulated by Abeta in hippocampal cultures. Interestingly, there was a remarkable overlap with those miRNAs that are deregulated in Abeta-depositing APP23 transgenic mice and in human AD tissue. While the Abeta precursor protein APP itself is a target of miRNA regulation, the challenge resides in identifying further targets. Here, we expand the repertoire of miRNA target genes by identifying the 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) of TGFBI, TRIM2, SIRT1 and BTBD3 as being repressed by miR-9 and -181c, either alone or in combination. Taken together, our study identifies putative target genes of miRNAs miR-9 and 181c, which may function in brain homeostasis and disease pathogenesis.

21724950|t|Semagacestat pharmacokinetics are not significantly affected by formulation, food, or time of dosing in healthy participants.
21724950|a|Semagacestat, a gamma-secretase inhibitor, reduces formation of amyloid beta peptide. Two single-dose (140 mg), open-label, randomized, 3-period, crossover studies evaluated the effect of formulation, food, and time of dosing on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of semagacestat in healthy participants. The first study (n = 14) compared tablet to capsules. For all formulations, the median time to maximum plasma concentration (t(max)) was generally 1.0 hour. Plasma elimination was rapid, with a half-life of approximately 2.5 hours. Tablet form II bioavailability (F) relative to capsule was approximately 100% (F = 1.03 [90% confidence interval (CI), 0.96-1.10]). In the second study, participants (n = 27) received semagacestat either fed or fasting in the morning or fasting in the evening. No significant change in exposure (AUC(0- ) [area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to infinity] ratio = 1.02, [90% CI, 0.990-1.05]) occurred with food, whereas maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) declined approximately 15%, and median t(max) was delayed to 1.5 hours. Time of dosing made no significant difference in AUC(0- ), C(max), or t(max) (AUC(0- ) ratio 1.01, [90% CI, 0.975-1.04]). No clinically significant safety concerns occurred in either study. Accordingly, semagacestat may be dosed without regard to formulation, food, or time of administration.

21725355|t|Neutralization of the gamma-secretase activity by monoclonal antibody against extracellular domain of nicastrin.
21725355|a|Several lines of evidence suggest that aberrant Notch signaling contributes to the development of several types of cancer. Activation of Notch receptor is executed through intramembrane proteolysis by gamma-secretase, which is a multimeric membrane-embedded protease comprised of presenilin, nicastrin (NCT), anterior pharynx defective 1 and PEN-2. In this study, we report the neutralization of the gamma-secretase activity by a novel monoclonal antibody A5226A against the extracellular domain of NCT, generated by using a recombinant budded baculovirus as an immunogen. This antibody recognized fully glycosylated mature NCT in the active gamma-secretase complex on the cell surface, and inhibited the gamma-secretase activity by competing with the substrate binding in vitro. Moreover, A5226A abolished the gamma-secretase activity-dependent growth of cancer cells in a xenograft model. Our data provide compelling evidence that NCT is a molecular target for the mechanism-based inhibition of gamma-secretase, and that targeting NCT might be a novel therapeutic strategy against cancer caused by aberrant gamma-secretase activity and Notch signaling.

21735075|t|Xanthoceraside attenuates amyloid beta peptide25-35-induced learning and memory impairments in mice.
21735075|a|RATIONALE: In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the deposition of amyloid peptides is invariably associated with oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. Xanthoceraside has anti-inflammatory and antioxidative activities. However, it remains unclear whether xanthoceraside improves amyloid beta (Abeta)-induced neurotoxicity. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of xanthoceraside on behavioral impairments, inflammatory responses, and oxidative stress induced by Abeta peptide(25-35) (Abeta(25-35)) in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The mice were treated orally with xanthoceraside (0.02, 0.08, or 0.32 mg/kg, once daily) after the intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta(25-35) (day 0). Cognitive functions were evaluated in Y-maze (day 6) and novel object recognition tests (days 7 and 8). Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nitrotyrosine levels in the hippocampus were examined (day 9). The mRNA expressions of iNOS and interleukin-4 (IL-4) in the hippocampus were measured 2 h and 3 days after the Abeta(25-35) injection by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Xanthoceraside significantly attenuated behavioral impairments induced by Abeta(25-35) in the Y-maze and novel object recognition tests. Repeated treatment with xanthoceraside significantly inhibited the increase in the expression of iNOS and nitrotyrosine in the hippocampus induced by Abeta(25-35), which is associated with an enhanced expression of the IL-4 mRNA. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that xanthoceraside attenuates memory impairments through amelioration of oxidative stress and inflammatory responses induced by Abeta(25-35) and is a potential candidate for an AD treatment.

21739354|t|Spectral unmixing imaging of wavelength-responsive fluorescent probes: an application for the real-time report of amyloid Beta species in Alzheimer's disease.
21739354|a|PURPOSE: The goal of the study was to investigate a method for the real-time assessment of a target concentration in vivo using a combination of a spectral unmixing technique and a fluorescent probe specific for amyloid beta (Abeta) species, the biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD). PROCEDURES: The probe CRANAD-3 has a significant emission wavelength shift upon binding to Abeta species. It was used to differentiate a bound probe from an unbound probe in a phantom, ex vivo in brain slices and whole brain, and in vivo in a transgenic mouse model of AD. RESULTS: The ex vivo unmixing imaging of AD brain clearly showed differential distribution of the bound and unbound probes between the brain tissue and blood vessels. The in vivo unmixed signals of bound CRANAD-3 reached a plateau with increasing dosage, demonstrating that these signals correspond to Abeta content, not probe injected dose. CONCLUSION: This study provided evidence that signals processed by the spectral unmixing technique could be used as a real-time reporter of Abeta species loading in vivo and ex vivo.

21741124|t|Fyn knock-down increases Abeta, decreases phospho-tau, and worsens spatial learning in 3xTg-AD mice.
21741124|a|Fyn kinase phosphorylates tau and exacerbates amyloid beta (Abeta)-mediated synaptic dysfunction. However, Fyn also increases the nonpathological cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), suggesting opposing roles for Fyn in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To determine the effect of Fyn on both Abeta and tau pathologies, we crossed homozygous Alzheimer's disease triple transgenic (3xTg) mice harboring mutations in amyloid precursor protein, presenilin-1, and tau with wild-type or Fyn knockout mice to generate Fyn(+/+)3xTg(+/-) or Fyn(+/-)3xTg(+/-) mice. We found that Fyn(+/-)3xTg(+/-) mice had increased soluble and intracellular Abeta, and these changes were accompanied by impaired performance on the Morris water maze at 18 months. Fyn(+/-)3xTg(+/-) mice had decreased phosphorylated tau at 15-18 months (as did Fyn knockout mice), but Fyn(+/-)3xTg(+/-) mice had increased phosphorylated tau by 24 months. In addition, we observed that Fyn(+/-)3xTg(+/-) males were delayed in developing Abeta pathology compared with females, and displayed better spatial learning performance at 18 months. Overall, these findings suggest that loss of Fyn at early stages of disease increases soluble Abeta accumulation and worsens spatial learning in the absence of changes in tau phosphorylation.

21741125|t|AD synapses contain abundant Abeta monomer and multiple soluble oligomers, including a 56-kDa assembly.
21741125|a|Much evidence indicates that soluble amyloid beta (Abeta) oligomers are key mediators of early cognitive loss, but the localization and key peptide species remain unclear. We have used flow cytometry analysis to demonstrate that surviving Alzheimer's disease (AD) synapses accumulate both Abeta and phosphorylated tau (p-tau). The present experiments use peptide-specific X-map assays and Western blot analyses to identify the Abeta peptide species in synaptosome-enriched samples from normal human subjects, neurologic controls, and AD cases. Abeta40 peptide levels did not vary, but both Abeta42 and Abeta oligomers were increased in soluble AD extracts, with oligomer levels 20-fold higher in aqueous compared with detergent extracts. In Western blot analysis, a ladder of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-stable oligomers was observed in AD cases, varying in size from monomer, the major peptide observed, to larger assemblies up to about 200 kDa and larger. Multiple oligomers, including monomer, small oligomers, a 56-kDa assembly, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) were correlated with the Abeta level measured in flow cytometry-purified synaptosomes. These results suggest that multiple amyloid precursor protein processing pathways are active in AD synapses and multiple soluble oligomeric assemblies may contribute to synaptic dysfunction.

21741127|t|Serial CSF sampling in Alzheimer's disease: specific versus non-specific markers.
21741127|a|In this longitudinal study we investigated change over time in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of amyloid-beta 40 and 42 (Abeta40 and Abeta42), total tau (tau), tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (ptau-181), isoprostane, neurofilaments heavy (NfH) and light (NfL). Twenty-four nondemented subjects, 62 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 68 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients underwent 2 lumbar punctures, with minimum interval of 6, and a mean +- SD of 24 +- 13 months. Linear mixed models were used to assess change over time. Amyloid-beta 42, tau, and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181, differentiated between diagnosis groups (p < 0.05), whereas isoprostane, neurofilaments heavy, and NfL did not. In contrast, effects of follow-up time were only found for nonspecific CSF biomarkers: levels of NfL decreased, and levels of isoprostane, amyloid-beta 40, and tau increased over time (p < 0.05). Isoprostane showed the largest increase. In addition, increase in isoprostane was associated with progression of mild cognitive impairment to AD, and with cognitive decline as reflected by change in Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). Contrary to AD-specific markers, nonspecific CSF biomarkers, most notably isoprostane, showed change over time. These markers could potentially be used to monitor disease progression in AD.

21749739|t|Predictors of rapid cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease: results from the Australian imaging, biomarkers and lifestyle (AIBL) study of ageing.
21749739|a|BACKGROUND: The AIBL study, which commenced in November 2006, is a two-center prospective study of a cohort of 1112 volunteers aged 60+. The cohort includes 211 patients meeting NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for Alzheimer's disease (AD) (180 probable and 31 possible). We aimed to identify factors associated with rapid cognitive decline over 18 months in this cohort of AD patients. METHODS: We defined rapid cognitive decline as a drop of 6 points or more on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) between baseline and 18-month follow-up. Analyses were also conducted with a threshold of 4, 5, 7 and 8 points, as well as with and without subjects who had died or were too severely affected to be interviewed at 18 months and after, both including and excluding subjects whose AD diagnosis was "possible" AD. We sought correlations between rapid cognitive decline and demographic, clinical and biological variables. RESULTS: Of the 211 AD patients recruited at baseline, we had available data for 156 (73.9%) patients at 18 months. Fifty-one patients were considered rapid cognitive decliners (32.7%). A higher Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR) and higher CDR "sum of boxes" score at baseline were the major predictors of rapid cognitive decline in this population. Furthermore, using logistic regression model analysis, patients treated with a cholinesterase inhibitor (CheI) had a higher risk of being rapid cognitive decliners, as did males and those of younger age. CONCLUSIONS: Almost one third of patients satisfying established research criteria for AD experienced rapid cognitive decline. Worse baseline functional and cognitive status and treatment with a CheI were the major factors associated with rapid cognitive decline over 18 months in this population.

21762376|t|Contribution of genetic and dietary insulin resistance to Alzheimer phenotype in APP/PS1 transgenic mice.
21762376|a|According to epidemiological studies, type-2 diabetes increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we induced hyperglycaemia in mice overexpressing mutant amyloid precursor protein and presenilin-1 (APdE9) either by cross-breeding them with pancreatic insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) overexpressing mice or by feeding them with high-fat diet. Glucose and insulin tolerance tests revealed significant hyperglycaemia in mice overexpressing IGF-2, which was exacerbated by high-fat diet. However, sustained hyperinsulinaemia and insulin resistance were observed only in mice co-expressing IGF-2 and APdE9 without correlation to insulin levels in brain. In behavioural tests in aged mice, APdE9 was associated with poor spatial learning and the combination of IGF-2 and high-fat diet further impaired learning. Neither high-fat diet nor IGF-2 increased beta-amyloid burden in the brain. In male mice, IGF-2 increased beta-amyloid 42/40 ratio, which correlated with poor spatial learning. In contrast, inhibitory phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta, which correlated with good spatial learning, was increased in APdE9 and IGF-2 female mice on standard diet, but not on high-fat diet. Interestingly, high-fat diet altered tau isoform expression and increased phosphorylation of tau at Ser202 site in female mice regardless of genotype. These findings provide evidence for new regulatory mechanisms that link type-2 diabetes and Alzheimer pathology.

21763787|t|Should Alzheimer's disease be equated with human brain ageing? A maladaptive interaction between brain evolution and senescence.
21763787|a|In this review Alzheimer's disease is seen as a maladaptive interaction between human brain evolution and senescence. It is predicted to occur in everyone although does not necessarily lead to dementia. The pathological process is initiated in relation to a senescence mediated functional down-regulation in the posteromedial cortex (Initiation Phase). This leads to a loss of glutamatergic excitatory input to layer II entorhinal cortex neurons. A human specific maladaptive neuroplastic response is initiated in these neurons leading to neuronal dysfunction, NFT formation and death. This leads to further loss of glutamatergic excitatory input and propagation of the maladaptive response along excitatory pathways linking evolutionary progressed vulnerable neurons (Propagation Phase). Eventually neurons are affected in many brain areas resulting in dementia. Possible therapeutic approaches include enhancing glutamatergic transmission. The theory may have implications with regards to how Alzheimer's disease is classified.

21764480|a|HIV-1-infected brains are characterized by elevated depositions of amyloid beta (Abeta); however, the interactions between Abeta and HIV-1 are poorly understood. In the present study, we administered specific HIV-1 protein Tat into the cerebral vasculature of 50-52-week-old double transgenic (B6C3-Tg) mice that express a chimeric mouse/human amyloid precursor protein (Mo/HuAPP695swe) and a mutant human presenilin 1 (PS1-dE9) and are characterized by increased Abeta depositions in the brain. Exposure to Tat increased permeability across cerebral capillaries, enhanced disruption of zonula occludens (ZO)-1 tight junction protein, and elevated brain expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in B6C3-Tg mice as compared with age-matched littermate controls. These changes were associated with increased leukocyte attachment and their transcapillary migration. The majority of Tat-induced effects were attenuated by treatment with a specific Rho inhibitor, hydroxyfasudil. The results of animal experiments were reproduced in cultured brain endothelial cells exposed to Abeta and/or Tat. The present data indicate that increased brain levels of Abeta can enhance vascular toxicity and proinflammatory responses induced by HIV-1 protein Tat.

21790829|t|The PKR activator PACT is induced by Abeta: involvement in Alzheimer's disease.
21790829|a|The neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) include senile plaques made of Abeta peptide, neurofibrillary tangles containing hyperphosphorylated tau protein and neuronal loss. The pro-apoptotic kinase PKR can be activated by Abeta and can phosphorylate tau protein via GSK3beta kinase activation. The activated form of PKR (pPKR) accumulates in affected neurons and could participate in neuronal degeneration in AD. The mechanism of abnormal PKR activation in AD is not elucidated but could be linked to the PKR activator PACT. PACT stainings, and levels were assessed in the brains of AD patients and in APP/PS1 knock-in transgenic mice and in cell cultures exposed to stresses. We showed that PACT and pPKR colocalizations are enhanced in AD brains. Their levels are increased and correlated in AD and APP/PS1 knock-in mice brains. In human neuroblastoma cells exposed to Abeta, tunicamycin or H2O2, PACT and pPKR concentrations are increased. PACT then PKR inhibitions indicate that PACT is upstream of PKR activation. Our findings demonstrate that PACT levels are enhanced in AD brains and could partly be caused by the action of Abeta. In addition, PACT participates in PKR activation. The PACT-PKR pathway represents a potential link between Abeta accumulation, PKR activation and tau phosphorylation.

21803450|t|The APP intracellular domain (AICD) potentiates ER stress-induced apoptosis.
21803450|a|Here we employed human SHEP neuroblastoma cells either stably or inducibly expressing the amyloid precursor protein (APP) intracellular domain (AICD) to investigate its ability to modulate stress-induced cell death. Analysis of effector caspase activation revealed that AICD overexpression was specifically associated with an increased sensitivity to apoptosis induced by the 2 endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stressors thapsigargin and tunicamycin, but not by staurosporine (STS). Basal and ER stress-induced expression of Bip/Grp78 and C/EBP-homologous protein/GADD153 were not altered by AICD implying that AICD potentiated cell death downstream or independent of the conserved unfolded protein response (UPR). Interestingly, quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis and reporter gene assays revealed that AICD significantly downregulated messenger RNA levels of the Alzheimer's disease susceptibility gene ApoJ/clusterin, indicating transcriptional repression. Knockdown of ApoJ/clusterin mimicked the effect of AICD on ER stress-induced apoptosis, but had no discernible effect on staurosporine-induced cell death. Our data suggest that altered levels of AICD may abolish the prosurvival function of ApoJ/clusterin and increase the susceptibility of neurons to ER stress-mediated cell death, a pathway that may contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

21805327|t|Probucol suppresses enterocytic accumulation of amyloid-beta induced by saturated fat and cholesterol feeding.
21805327|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) is secreted from lipogenic organs such as intestine and liver as an apolipoprotein of nascent triacylglycerol rich lipoproteins. Chronically elevated plasma Abeta may compromise cerebrovascular integrity and exacerbate amyloidosis--a hallmark feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Probucol is a hypocholesterolemic agent that reduces amyloid burden in transgenic amyloid mice, but the mechanisms for this effect are presently unclear. In this study, the effect of Probucol on intestinal lipoprotein-Abeta homeostasis was explored. Wild-type mice were fed a control low-fat diet and enterocytic Abeta was stimulated by high-fat (HF) diet enriched in 10% (w/w) saturated fat and 1% (w/w) cholesterol for the duration of 1 month. Mice treated with Probucol had the drug incorporated into the chow at 1% (w/w). Quantitative immunofluorescence was utilised to determine intestinal apolipoprotein B (apo B) and Abeta abundance. We found apo B in both the perinuclear region of the enterocytes and the lacteals in all groups. However, HF feeding and Probucol treatment increased secretion of apo B into the lacteals without any change in net villi abundance. On the other hand, HF-induced enterocytic perinuclear Abeta was significantly attenuated by Probucol. No significant changes in Abeta were observed within the lacteals. The findings of this study support the notion that Probucol suppresses dietary fat induced stimulation of Abeta biosynthesis and attenuate availability of apo B lipoprotein-Abeta for secretion.

21821316|t|Blood pressure is associated with higher brain amyloid burden and lower glucose metabolism in healthy late middle-age persons.
21821316|a|Epidemiological studies suggest that elevated blood pressure (BP) in midlife is associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in late life. In this preliminary study, we investigated the extent to which BP measurements are related to positron emission tomography (PET) measurements of fibrillar amyloid-beta burden using Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB) and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET measures of cerebral metabolic rate for glucose metabolism (CMRgl) in cognitively normal, late middle-aged to older adult apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 homozygotes, heterozygotes and noncarriers. PiB PET results revealed that systolic BP (SBP) and pulse pressure (PP) were each positively correlated with cerebral-to-cerebellar PiB distribution volume ratio (DVR) in frontal, temporal, and posterior-cingulate/precuneus regions, whereas no significant positive correlations were found between PiB distribution volume ratios and diastolic BP (DBP). FDG PET results revealed significant inverse correlations between each of the BP measures and lower glucose metabolism in frontal and temporal brain regions. These preliminary findings provide additional evidence that higher BP, likely a reflection of arterial stiffness, during late midlife may be associated with increased risk of presymptomatic AD.

21822699|t|Atypical presentation of a novel Presenilin 1 R377W mutation: sporadic, late-onset Alzheimer disease with epilepsy and frontotemporal atrophy.
21822699|a|Mutations within Presenilin 1 (PSEN1) represent the most common cause of monogenic Alzheimer Disease (AD). The clinical phenotype is highly variable, even if early onset disease with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and presenting memory deficits usually occur. In the present work, we described the case of a late-onset AD patient, without any positive family history for dementia, and associated with seizures and behavioural symptoms. Structural and functional neuroimaging showed frontotemporal changes without posterior biparietal brain abnormalities. Cerebrospinal analysis was consistent with AD pattern, with decreased Abeta42 and increased Tau and phospho-Tau. A novel pathogenetic mutation within PSEN1 gene was detected within exon 8, leading to a substitution from arginine to tryptophan (AGG > TGG: R377W), affecting a splice junction and protein function. The case herein reported further confirms the heterogeneity of PSEN1 mutations and the need to take into account genetic screening in those cases with atypical presentation.

21826062|t|MRK003, a gamma-secretase inhibitor exhibits promising in vitro pre-clinical activity in multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
21826062|a|Notch-stimulated signaling cascade results in transcriptional regulation of genes involved in cell fate decision, apoptosis and proliferation and has been implicated in various malignancies. Here, we investigated the impact of MRK003, an inhibitor of this pathway, on myeloma and lymphoma cells. We first studied the expression patterns of notch receptors and ligands on multiple myeloma (MM) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) cell lines. Next, we used a gamma-secretase inhibitor, MRK003 to test the importance of notch-stimulated pathways in MM and NHL disease biology. We observed expression of notch receptors and ligands on MM and NHL cell lines. MRK003 treatment induced caspase-dependent apoptosis and inhibited proliferation of MM and NHL cell lines and patient cells. Examination of signaling events after treatment showed time-dependent decrease in levels of the notch intracellular domain, Hes1 and c-Myc. MRK003 downregulated cyclin D1, Bcl-Xl and Xiap levels in NHL cells and p21, Bcl-2 and Bcl-Xl in MM cells. In addition, MRK003 caused an upregulation of pAkt, indicating crosstalk with the PI3K/Akt pathway. We evaluated MRK003 in combination with Akt1/2 kinase inhibitor and observed synergy in killing MM and NHL cell lines examined.

21855175|t|3xTgAD mice exhibit altered behavior and elevated Abeta after chronic mild social stress.
21855175|a|Chronic stress may be a risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), but most studies of the effects of stress in models of AD utilize acute adverse stressors of questionable clinical relevance. The goal of this work was to determine how chronic psychosocial stress affects behavioral and pathological outcomes in an animal model of AD, and to elucidate underlying mechanisms. A triple-transgenic mouse model of AD (3xTgAD mice) and nontransgenic control mice were used to test for an affect of chronic mild social stress on blood glucose, plasma glucocorticoids, plasma insulin, anxiety, and hippocampal amyloid beta-particle (Abeta), phosphorylated tau (ptau), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. Despite the fact that both control and 3xTgAD mice experienced rises in corticosterone during episodes of mild social stress, at the end of the 6-week stress period 3xTgAD mice displayed increased anxiety, elevated levels of Abeta oligomers and intraneuronal Abeta, and decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels, whereas control mice did not. Findings suggest 3xTgAD mice are more vulnerable than control mice to chronic psychosocial stress, and that such chronic stress exacerbates Abeta accumulation and impairs neurotrophic signaling.

21856333|t|Inhibition of PKA attenuates memory deficits induced by beta-amyloid (1-42), and decreases oxidative stress and NF-kappaB transcription factors.
21856333|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most relevant cause of dementia in elderly, is characterized by amyloid beta (Abeta) containing plaques and neurofibrillatory tangles, synaptic and neuronal loss, along with progressive cognitive impairment in short-term memory. However, mechanistic links between protein kinase A (PKA), oxidative stress and memory loss in response to Abeta remain elusive. In the present study, we examined the effects of post-training bilateral intra-hippocampal infusions of the specific protein kinase AII inhibitor, H-89, on memory deficits induced by Abeta (1-42) in Abeta-pretreated rats. H-89 and Abeta were administered immediately after completion of training. All animals were trained for 4 consecutive days and tested 9 and 19 days after the infusions. Significant differences were observed in the time and distance of finding the hidden platform in Abeta treated animals after 19 days. Interestingly, intra-hippocampal infusion of H-89 (5muM/side) significantly prevented the Abeta-induced memory impairment. Furthermore, evaluation of NFkappaB (nuclear factor-kappaB), and antioxidant enzymes, such as gamma-GCS (glutamylcysteine synthetase), HO-1 (hemeoxygenase-1), GSH (glutathione), and SOD (superoxide dismutase) confirmed the protective effect of H-89. Given the possible neuroprotective effects of H-89 on Abeta-induced memory impairment, our results may open a new avenue for the prevention of AD by PKAII signaling pathway inhibitor.

21858698|t|Effect of phenolic compounds against Abeta aggregation and Abeta-induced toxicity in transgenic C. elegans.
21858698|a|Substantial evidence suggests that the aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide into fibrillar structures that is rich in beta-sheets is implicated as the cause of Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, an attractive therapeutic strategy is to prevent or alter Abeta aggregation. Phenolic compounds are natural substances that are composed of one or more aromatic phenolic rings and present in wine, tea, fruits, vegetables and a wide variety of plants. In this work, we investigated the effects of ferulic acid, morin, quercetin and gossypol against Abeta aggregation. From the ThT and turbidity assays, it is observed that in addition to the fibril aggregate, another type of aggregate is formed in the presence of morin, quercetin, and gossypol. On the other hand, ferulic acid did not prevent fibril formation, but it did appear to reduce the average length of fibrils compared to Abeta alone. To study the protective effects of phenolic compounds on Abeta-induced toxicity, we utilized the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) as an in vivo model organism, human Abeta is expressed intracellularly in the body wall muscle. We found that exposure of Caenorhabditis elegans to ferulic acid give more protection against Abeta toxicity than morin, quercetin and gossypol.

21880018|t|Reduction in BACE1 decreases body weight, protects against diet-induced obesity and enhances insulin sensitivity in mice.
21880018|a|Insulin resistance and impaired glucose homoeostasis are important indicators of Type 2 diabetes and are early risk factors of AD (Alzheimer's disease). An essential feature of AD pathology is the presence of BACE1 (beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1), which regulates production of toxic amyloid peptides. However, whether BACE1 also plays a role in glucose homoeostasis is presently unknown. We have used transgenic mice to analyse the effects of loss of BACE1 on body weight, and lipid and glucose homoeostasis. BACE1-/- mice are lean, with decreased adiposity, higher energy expenditure, and improved glucose disposal and peripheral insulin sensitivity than wild-type littermates. BACE1-/- mice are also protected from diet-induced obesity. BACE1-deficient skeletal muscle and liver exhibit improved insulin sensitivity. In a skeletal muscle cell line, BACE1 inhibition increased glucose uptake and enhanced insulin sensitivity. The loss of BACE1 is associated with increased levels of UCP1 (uncoupling protein 1) in BAT (brown adipose tissue) and UCP2 and UCP3 mRNA in skeletal muscle, indicative of increased uncoupled respiration and metabolic inefficiency. Thus BACE1 levels may play a critical role in glucose and lipid homoeostasis in conditions of chronic nutrient excess. Therefore strategies that ameliorate BACE1 activity may be important novel approaches for the treatment of diabetes.

21880397|t|Amyloid neuropathology in the single Arctic APP transgenic model affects interconnected brain regions.
21880397|a|The Arctic APP mutation (E693G) within the amyloid beta (Abeta) domain of amyloid precursor protein (APP) leads to dementia with clinical features similar to Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is believed to be mediated via increased formation of protofibrils. We have generated a transgenic mouse model, TgAPParc, with neuron-specific expression of human amyloid precursor protein with the Arctic mutation (hAPParc), showing mild amyloid pathology with a relatively late onset. Here we performed a detailed analysis of the spatiotemporal progression of neuropathology in homozygous TgAPParc, focusing on intracellular Abeta and diffuse Abeta aggregates rather than amyloid plaques. We show that the neuropathology in homozygous TgAPParc mice starts with intracellular Abeta aggregates, which is followed by diffuse extracellular Abeta deposits in subiculum that later expands to brain regions receiving neuronal projections from regions already affected. Together this suggests that the pathology in TgAPParc mice affects interconnected brain regions and may represent a valuable tool to study the spread and progression of neuropathology in Alzheimer's disease.

21883149|t|A beta-amyloid oligomer directly modulates P/Q-type calcium currents in Xenopus oocytes.
21883149|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: beta-amyloid (Abeta) oligomers have been implicated in the early pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). While the precise nature of the molecular target has not been fully revealed, a number of studies have indicated that Abeta oligomers modulate neuron-specific ion channels. We recently provided evidence that Abeta oligomers suppress isolated P/Q-type calcium currents in cultured nerve cells. Using a heterologous expression system, we aimed to prove a direct effect on the membrane channel mediating such current. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The effects of a synthetically generated Abeta oligomer, Abeta globulomer, were investigated on P/Q-type currents recorded from Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing the full P/Q-type calcium channel or the pore-forming subunit only. We also examined the effects of Abeta globulomer on recombinant NMDA receptor currents. Finally, we compared the modulation by Abeta globulomer with that induced by a synthetic monomeric Abeta. KEY RESULTS: Abeta globulomer directly and dose-dependently modulated P/Q-type calcium channels. A leftward shift of the current-voltage curve indicated that the threshold for channel opening was reduced. The effect of Abeta globulomer was also present when only the alpha1A subunit of the normally tripartite channel was expressed. In contrast, the monomeric Abeta had no effect on P/Q current. Also globulomer Abeta had no effect on glutamate-induced NMDA currents. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The alpha1A subunit of the P/Q-type calcium channel is directly modulated by oligomeric Abeta. Threshold reduction as well as an increase in current at synaptic terminals may facilitate vesicle release and could trigger excitotoxic events in the brains of patients with AD.

21883223|t|Activation of alpha-secretase cleavage.
21883223|a|Alpha-secretase-mediated cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) releases the neuroprotective APP fragment salphaAPP and prevents amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) generation. Moreover, alpha-secretase-like cleavage of the Abeta transporter 'receptor for advanced glycation end products' counteracts the import of blood Abeta into the brain. Assuming that Abeta is responsible for the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), activation of alpha-secretase should be preventive. alpha-Secretase-mediated APP cleavage can be activated via several G protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases. Protein kinase C, mitogen-activated protein kinases, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, cAMP and calcium are activators of receptor-induced alpha-secretase cleavage. Selective targeting of receptor subtypes expressed in brain regions affected by AD appears reasonable. Therefore, the PACAP receptor PAC1 and possibly the serotonin 5-HT(6) receptor subtype are promising targets. Activation of APP alpha-secretase cleavage also occurs upon blockade of cholesterol synthesis by statins or zaragozic acid A. Under physiological statin concentrations, the brain cholesterol content is not influenced. Statins likely inhibit Abeta production in the blood by alpha-secretase activation which is possibly sufficient to inhibit AD development. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) acts as alpha-secretase on APP. By targeting the nuclear retinoic acid receptor beta, the expression of ADAM10 and non-amyloidogenic APP processing can be enhanced. Excessive activation of ADAM10 should be avoided because ADAM10 and also ADAM17 are not APP-specific. Both ADAM proteins cleave various substrates, and therefore have been associated with tumorigenesis and tumor progression.

21884802|t|Not quite PIB-positive, not quite PIB-negative: slight PIB elevations in elderly normal control subjects are biologically relevant.
21884802|a|Researchers employing Pittsburgh Compound B positron emission tomography (PIB-PET) imaging have consistently indentified old normal control (oNC) subjects with elevated tracer uptake, suggesting the presence of beta-amyloid deposition in these individuals. However, a consensus regarding the level at which PIB reveals a biologically meaningful signal does not exist (ie. an appropriate cutoff value for PIB positivity remains unclear). In this exploratory study, we sought to investigate the range of PIB distribution volume ratio (DVR) values present in our oNC cohort (N=75, age range=58-97). oNC subjects were classified based on global PIB index values (average DVR across prefrontal, parietal, lateral temporal and cingulate cortices) by employing two approaches: (1) an iterative outlier approach that revealed a cutoff value of 1.16 (IO-cutoff) and (2) an approach using data from a sample of young normal control subjects (N=11, age range=20-30) that yielded a cutoff value of 1.08 (yNC-cutoff). oNC subjects falling above the IO-cutoff had values similar to AD subjects ("PIB+", 15%). Subjects falling between the 2 cutoffs were considered to have ambiguous PIB status ("Ambig", 20%) and the remaining oNC were considered "PIB-" (65%). Additional measures capturing focal DVR magnitude and extent of elevated DVR values were consistent with the classification scheme using PIB index values, and revealed evidence for elevated DVR values in a subset of PIB- oNC subjects. Furthermore, there were a greater proportion of ambiguously elevated values compared to low values, and these elevated values were present in regions known to show amyloid deposition. The analyses presented in this study, in conjunction with recently published pathological data, suggest a biological relevance of slight PIB elevations in aging.

21898270|t|IL-33 is induced by amyloid-beta stimulation and regulates inflammatory cytokine production in retinal pigment epithelium cells.
21898270|a|Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the predominant cause of irreversible blindness in the elderly population. Despite intensive basic and clinical research, its pathogenesis remains unclear. However, evidence suggests that immunological and inflammatory factors contribute to the pathogenesis of AMD. A newly identified cytokine, IL-33, appears to be an important pro-inflammatory cytokine promoting tissue inflammation. In this study, IL-33 was increased through amyloid-beta(1-40) (Abeta(1-40)) stimulation and regulated inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, IL-8, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha secretion using different signaling pathways in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. Furthermore, ST2L, the important component of the IL-33 receptor, was significantly increased following recombinant human IL-33 stimulation in RPE cells. These findings suggest that IL-33-mediated inflammatory responses in RPE cells are involved in the pathogenesis of AMD. Greater understanding of the inflammatory effect of IL-33 and its role in RPE cells should aid the development of future clinical therapeutics and enable novel pharmacological approaches towards the prevention of AMD.

21901424|t|Amyloid pathway-based candidate gene analysis of [(11)C]PiB-PET in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort.
21901424|a|Amyloid imaging with [(11)C]Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB) provides in vivo data on plaque deposition in those with, or at risk for, Alzheimer's disease (AD). We performed a gene-based association analysis of 15 quality-controlled amyloid-pathway associated candidate genes in 103 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants. The mean normalized PiB uptake value across four brain regions known to have amyloid deposition in AD was used as a quantitative phenotype. The minor allele of an intronic SNP within DHCR24 was identified and associated with a lower average PiB uptake. Further investigation at whole-brain voxel-wise level indicated that non-carriers of the minor allele had higher PiB uptake in frontal regions compared to carriers. DHCR24 has been previously shown to confer resistance against beta-amyloid and oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, thus our findings support a neuroprotective role. Pathway-based genetic analysis of targeted molecular imaging phenotypes appears promising to help elucidate disease pathophysiology and identify potential therapeutic targets.

21911655|t|Intranasal insulin therapy for Alzheimer disease and amnestic mild cognitive impairment: a pilot clinical trial.
21911655|a|OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of intranasal insulin administration on cognition, function, cerebral glucose metabolism, and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer disease (AD). DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Clinical research unit of a Veterans Affairs medical center. PARTICIPANTS: The intent-to-treat sample consisted of 104 adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (n = 64) or mild to moderate AD (n = 40). Intervention  Participants received placebo (n = 30), 20 IU of insulin (n = 36), or 40 IU of insulin (n = 38) for 4 months, administered with a nasal drug delivery device (Kurve Technology, Bothell, Washington). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary measures consisted of delayed story recall score and the Dementia Severity Rating Scale score, and secondary measures included the Alzheimer Disease's Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) score and the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-activities of daily living (ADCS-ADL) scale. A subset of participants underwent lumbar puncture (n = 23) and positron emission tomography with fludeoxyglucose F 18 (n = 40) before and after treatment. RESULTS: Outcome measures were analyzed using repeated-measures analysis of covariance. Treatment with 20 IU of insulin improved delayed memory (P < .05), and both doses of insulin (20 and 40 IU) preserved caregiver-rated functional ability (P < .01). Both insulin doses also preserved general cognition as assessed by the ADAS-cog score for younger participants and functional abilities as assessed by the ADCS-ADL scale for adults with AD (P < .05). Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers did not change for insulin-treated participants as a group, but, in exploratory analyses, changes in memory and function were associated with changes in the Abeta42 level and in the tau protein-to-Abeta42 ratio in cerebrospinal fluid. Placebo-assigned participants showed decreased fludeoxyglucose F 18 uptake in the parietotemporal, frontal, precuneus, and cuneus regions and insulin-minimized progression. No treatment-related severe adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: These results support longer trials of intranasal insulin therapy for patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and patients with AD. Trial Registration  clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00438568.

21911660|t|Effects of age and amyloid deposition on Abeta dynamics in the human central nervous system.
21911660|a|BACKGROUND: The amyloid hypothesis predicts that increased production or decreased clearance of beta-amyloid (Abeta) leads to amyloidosis, which ultimately culminates in Alzheimer disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether dynamic changes in Abeta levels in the human central nervous system may be altered by aging or by the pathology of AD and thus contribute to the risk of AD. DESIGN: Repeated-measures case-control study. SETTING: Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis, Missouri. PARTICIPANTS: Participants with amyloid deposition, participants without amyloid deposition, and younger normal control participants. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: In this study, hourly cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta concentrations were compared with age, status of amyloid deposition, electroencephalography, and video recording data. RESULTS: Linear increases were observed over time in the Abeta levels in CSF samples obtained from the younger normal control participants and the older participants without amyloid deposition, but not from the older participants with amyloid deposition. Significant circadian patterns were observed in the Abeta levels in CSF samples obtained from the younger control participants; however, circadian amplitudes decreased in both older participants without amyloid deposition and older participants with amyloid deposition. Abeta diurnal concentrations were correlated with the amount of sleep but not with the various activities that the participants participated in while awake. CONCLUSIONS: A reduction in the linear increase in the Abeta levels in CSF samples that is associated with amyloid deposition and a decreased CSF Abeta diurnal pattern associated with increasing age disrupt the normal physiology of Abeta dynamics and may contribute to AD.

21912928|t|Analysis of amyloid precursor protein function in Drosophila                      melanogaster.
21912928|a|Amyloid precursor proteins (APPs) are evolutionary conserved from nematodes to man (Jacobsen and Iverfeldt in Cell Mol Life Sci 66:2299-2318, 2009) suggesting an important physiological function of these proteins. Human APP is a key factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease because its proteolytic processing results in the production of the neurotoxic Abeta-peptide, which accumulates in the amyloid plaques characteristic for this disease (Selkoe in Physiol Rev 81(2):741-766, 2001). However, the processing also leads to the production of several other fragments and the role of these products, as well as the function of the full-length protein is so far not well understood. The functional analysis of APP in vertebrates has been hampered by the fact that two close relatives, APLP1 and APLP2, exist and that knock-out mice for APP only show subtle defects. In contrast, invertebrates like Caenorhabditis                         elegans and Drosophila express only one APP-like protein but whereas a null mutation in the C. elegans APL-1 protein is lethal, flies lacking APPL (Amyloid Precursor Protein-like) are viable but show synaptic defects and behavioral abnormalities. Together with the analyses of flies that express APP proteins ectoptically or xenotopically, these studies show that APP proteins are involved in neuronal differentiation, neuritic outgrowth, and synapse formation. In addition, they play a role in long-term memory formation and maintaining brain integrity in adult flies.

21915767|t|Amyloid beta-heme peroxidase promoted protein nitrotyrosination: relevance to widespread protein nitration in Alzheimer's disease.
21915767|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide accumulation has been demonstrated to play a central role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Substantial evidence indicates that protein nitrotyrosination contributes to Abeta-dependent neurotoxicity; however, the molecular mechanism is unknown. Recent research has shown that Abeta complexes with heme to form Abeta-heme, and increases the pseudo-peroxidase activity of heme. We found that Abeta-heme uses H(2)O(2) and NO(2)(-) to cause nitration of enolase and synaptic proteins more effectively than heme. Thus, the increased peroxidase activity of Abeta-heme may be the molecular link between excess Abeta and the widespread protein nitration in AD. Interestingly, the site of enolase nitration that was catalyzed by Abeta-heme is different from that induced by heme. Moreover, the secondary structural perturbations of Abeta-heme-treated and heme-treated enolase are also different. These observations suggest that Abeta-heme targets specific amino acid sequences in enolase. Furthermore, our data show that Abeta-heme peroxidase activity is independent of the aggregation state of Abeta, suggesting an important role of soluble Abeta in addition to Abeta aggregates and oligomers in AD pathogenesis.

21916927|t|Prevalence and severity of cerebral amyloid angiopathy: a population-based study on very elderly Finns (Vantaa 85+).
21916927|a|BACKGROUND: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is frequent in patients with Alzheimer's disease while its prevalence in different populations is variable. We investigated the prevalence and severity of CAA in a very elderly Finnish population. METHODS: Neuropathological investigation was performed on 306 subjects from the population-based Vantaa 85+ Study (253 women, 53 men, mean age at death 92.3 years). The presence of CAA was analysed in six brain regions by using Congo red and immunohistochemistry with an antibody against amyloid beta peptide. The severity of CAA was assessed by counting the percentage of the CAA-positive blood vessels. RESULTS: In total, 69.6% of the participants (170 women, 43 men) had CAA, with median severity of 1.0%, inter-quartile range (IQR) 0-5.4% and range 0-72.7%. CAA was more prevalent (81.1% vs. 67.2%; P = 0.046) and severe (median 2.7%, IQR 0.4-7.5%, range 0-72.7%) in the men than in the women (median 1.0%, IQR 0-4.6%, range 0-52.8%; P = 0.004). Parietal lobe showed the highest prevalence (57.8%) whereas the severity was highest (median 1.0%, IQR 0-6.0%, range 0-77%) in the frontal lobe. Prevalence of CAA in the six regions was variable, but the severity indices between those regions correlated highly (P < 0.001 for all regions). Meningeal CAA was more prevalent (69.5%) than cortical (59.3%; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: CAA was highly prevalent, albeit mild, in the very old. The prevalence and severity of CAA were found to be highest in the frontal and parietal lobes respectively - independent of the staining method used (Congo red or amyloid beta peptide).

21925292|t|Cysteine Cathepsins in the secretory vesicle produce active peptides: Cathepsin L generates peptide neurotransmitters and cathepsin B produces beta-amyloid of Alzheimer's disease.
21925292|a|Recent new findings indicate significant biological roles of cysteine cathepsin proteases in secretory vesicles for production of biologically active peptides. Notably, cathepsin L in secretory vesicles functions as a key protease for proteolytic processing of proneuropeptides (and prohormones) into active neuropeptides that are released to mediate cell-cell communication in the nervous system for neurotransmission. Moreover, cathepsin B in secretory vesicles has been recently identified as a beta-secretase for production of neurotoxic beta- amyloid (Abeta) peptides that accumulate in Alzheimer's disease (AD), participating as a notable factor in the severe memory loss in AD. These secretory vesicle functions of cathepsins L and B for production of biologically active peptides contrast with the well-known role of cathepsin proteases in lysosomes for the degradation of proteins to result in their inactivation. The unique secretory vesicle proteome indicates proteins of distinct functional categories that provide the intravesicular environment for support of cysteine cathepsin functions. Features of the secretory vesicle protein systems insure optimized intravesicular conditions that support the proteolytic activity of cathepsins. These new findings of recently discovered biological roles of cathepsins L and B indicate their significance in human health and disease. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Proteolysis 50 years after the discovery of lysosome.

21931985|t|Functions of the APP gene family in the nervous system: insights from mouse models.
21931985|a|The amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as proteolytical cleavage of APP gives rise to the beta-amyloid peptide which is deposited in the brains of Alzheimer patients. During the past years, intense research efforts have been directed at elucidating the physiological function(s) of APP and the question of whether a perturbation of these functions contributes to AD pathogenesis. Indeed, a growing body of evidence has accumulated supporting a role of APP and the two closely related homologues APLP1 and APLP2 in various aspects of nervous system development and function, in particular, for synapse formation and function. This review summarizes recent insights into the in vivo role of the APP gene family from mice lacking individual or combinations of APP family members, with particular emphasis on recently generated knockin mice to examine the in vivo relevance of distinct functional domains.

21945306|t|Neurobiological elements of cognitive dysfunction in down syndrome: exploring the role of APP.
21945306|a|Down syndrome (DS) is the most common cause of cognitive dysfunction in children. Additionally, most adults with DS will eventually show both clinical and neuropathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The hippocampal formation constitutes the primary target for degeneration in both AD and DS. Over the past few years, we have studied the molecular mechanisms behind degeneration of this region and its major inputs in mouse models of DS. Our investigation has suggested that the loss of hippocampal inputs, particularly cholinergic and noradrenergic terminals, leads to de-afferentation of this region in the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS. Interestingly, we were able to link the overexpression of amyloid precursor protein (App) gene to degeneration of cholinergic and noradrenergic neurons in DS mouse models. We examined the underlying mechanisms of degeneration of multiple systems with extensive projections to the hippocampus in DS and its mouse models and the role of App overexpression in neurodegeneration. Understanding mechanisms behind hippocampal dysfunction has helped us to test several therapeutic strategies successfully in mouse models of DS. Here we review these strategies and mechanisms and discuss ways to translate our findings into possible interventions in humans.

21947943|t|beta-Amyloid protein (Abeta) and human amylin regulation of apoptotic genes occurs through the amylin receptor.
21947943|a|Deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein, a 39-43 amino acid peptide, in the brain is a major pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have previously provided evidence that in primary cultures of rat basal forebrain and human fetal neurons (HFNs), neurotoxic effects of oligomeric Abeta are expressed through the amylin receptor. In this study, we utilized RT-PCR arrays to compare RNA expression levels of 84 markers for pro and anti- apoptotic signalling pathways following exposure of HFNs to either Abeta(1-42) (20 muM) or human amylin (2 muM). Oligomeric Abeta(1-42) or human amylin was applied to HFNs alone or after pre-treatment of cultures with the amylin receptor antagonist, AC253. Changes in RNA levels were then quantified and compared to each other in order to identify increases or decreases in gene expression of apoptotic markers. Applications of Abeta(1-42) or human amylin, but not the inactive inverse sequence Abeta(42-1) or rat amylin, resulted in a time-dependent marked increase in mediators of apoptosis including a 10- to 30-fold elevations in caspases 3, 6, 9, BID and XIAP levels. Amylin receptor antagonists, AC253 (10 muM) or AC187 (10 muM), significantly attenuated the induction of several pro-apoptotic mediators up-regulated following exposure to Abeta(1-42) or human amylin and increased the expression of several anti-apoptotic markers. These data allow us to identify key elements in the Abeta-induced apoptosis that are blocked by antagonism of the amylin receptor and further support the potential for amylin receptor blockade as a potential therapeutic avenue in AD.

21948247|t|Exercise during pregnancy mitigates Alzheimer-like pathology in mouse offspring.
21948247|a|Physical activity protects brain function in healthy individuals and those with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Evidence for beneficial effects of parental exercise on the health status of their progeny is sparse and limited to nondiseased individuals. Here, we questioned whether maternal running interferes with offspring's AD-like pathology and sought to decipher the underlying mechanisms in TgCRND8 mice. Maternal stimulation was provided by voluntary wheel running vs. standard housing during pregnancy. Following 5 mo of standard housing of transgenic and wild-type offspring, their brains were examined for AD-related pathology and/or plasticity changes. Running during pregnancy reduced beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaque burden (-35%, P=0.017) and amyloidogenic APP processing in transgenic offspring and further improved the neurovascular function by orchestrating different Abeta transporters and increasing angiogenesis (+29%, P=0.022). This effect was accompanied by diminished inflammation, as indicated by reduced microgliosis (-20%, P=0.002) and down-regulation of other proinflammatory mediators, and resulted in less oxidative stress, as nitrotyrosine levels declined (-28%, P=0.029). Moreover, plasticity changes (in terms of up-regulation of reelin, synaptophysin, and ARC) were found not only in transgenic but also in wild-type offspring. We conclude that exercise during pregnancy provides long-lasting protection from neurodegeneration and improves brain plasticity in the otherwise unstimulated progeny.

21951164|t|Cerebral subcortical small vessel disease and its relation to cognition in elderly subjects: a pathological study in the Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Ageing (OPTIMA) cohort.
21951164|a|BACKGROUND: Subcortical small vessel disease (SVD) is known to contribute to vascular cognitive impairment and vascular dementia, but understanding about the extent of its influence is limited because there is a lack of consensus about how this pathology should be assessed. METHODS: In this study we have made use of a simple, novel, image-matching scoring system to assess the extent of SVD in a group of 70 cases from the prospectively assessed Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Ageing (OPTIMA) cohort. These cases were found at autopsy to have cerebrovascular disease and no other pathology except Braak stage 4 or less tau pathology, and insufficient amyloid plaque pathology to meet Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) criteria for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Pathology scores for SVD were correlated with cognitive scores [Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and cognitive section of the Cambridge Examination for Mental Disorders in the Elderly (CAMDEX) (CAMCOG)] at the last clinical assessment before death. RESULTS: The severity of SVD pathology was inversely related to cognitive score before death (P < 0.008 for MMSE and P < 0.024 for CAMCOG). Thirty-one per cent and 33% of cases were rated as demented by MMSE or CAMCOG respectively. The degree of dementia was generally mild. Age did not influence severity of SVD. CONCLUSIONS: An image-based scoring system for SVD in a group of 70 elderly subjects enabled the severity of SVD pathology to be assessed with results that showed a significant correlation between SVD pathology severity and cognitive impairment.

21952790|t|Structural aspects and physiological consequences of APP/APLP trans-dimerization.
21952790|a|The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is one of the key proteins in Alzheimer's disease (AD), as it is the precursor of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides accumulating in amyloid plaques. The processing of APP and the pathogenic features of especially Abeta oligomers have been analyzed in detail. Remarkably, there is accumulating evidence from cell biological and structural studies suggesting that APP and its mammalian homologs, the amyloid precursor-like proteins (APLP1 and APLP2), participate under physiological conditions via trans-cellular dimerization in synaptogenesis. This offers the possibility that loss of synapses in AD might be partially explained by dysfunction of APP/APLPs cell adhesion properties. In this review, structural characteristics of APP trans-cellular interaction will be placed critically in context with its putative physiological functions focusing on cell adhesion and synaptogenesis.

21952928|t|The phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase-glycogen synthase kinase 3beta pathway mediates bilobalide-induced reduction in amyloid beta-peptide.
21952928|a|Bilobalide (BB), a sesquiterpenoid extract of Ginkgo biloba leaves, has been demonstrated to have neuroprotective effects. The neuroprotective mechanisms were suggested to be associated with modulation of intracellular signaling cascades such as the phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Since some members of intracellular signalling pathways such as PI3K have been demonstrated to be involved in amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, the present study investigated whether BB has an influence on the beta-secretase-mediated APP cleavage via PI3K-dependent pathway. Using HT22 cells and SAMP8 mice (a senescence-accelerated strain of mice), this study showed that BB treatment reduced generation of two beta-secretase cleavage products of APP, the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) and soluble APPbeta (sAPPbeta), via PI3K-dependent pathway. Additionally, glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) signaling might be involved in BB-induced Abeta reduction as a downstream target of the activated PI3K pathway. BB showed no significant effects on beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1) or gamma-secretase but inhibited the beta-secretase activity of another protease cathepsin B, suggesting that BB-induced Abeta reduction was probably mediated through modulation of cathepsin B rather than BACE-1. Similarly, inhibition of GSK3beta did not affect BACE-1 activity but decreased cathepsin B activity, suggesting that the PI3K-GSK3beta pathway was probably involved in BB-induced Abeta reduction. Increasing evidence suggests that decreasing Abeta production in the brain via modulation of APP metabolism should be beneficial for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). BB may offer such an approach to combat AD.

The following CSF peptides were studied, blindly to the clinical diagnosis: beta-amyloid(1-42) peptide (Abeta(1-42)), Tau (T-tau), threonine-181 hyperphosphorylated tau protein (P-tau(181)), and beta-amyloid(1-40) peptide (Abeta(1-40)). From these measurements, Innotest  Amyloid Tau Index (IATI) was calculated for each patient. RESULTS: This assessment allowed to separate 83 biochemical profiles of AD and 67 non-Alzheimer's disease (non-AD), both AD and non-AD categories match with clinical data amounting to 73% and 90%, respectively. Among mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, CSF biomarkers led to discriminate those who are likely to be AD. We devoted a special section to Abeta(1-40) which is not a routine parameter but can help to confirm a pathological amyloid process as Abeta(1-42)/Abeta(1-40) ratio underlining the real decline of the Abeta(1-42). CONCLUSIONS: The interest of biomarkers and their ability to solve awkward cases were carefully noticed all the more when a discrepancy between clinical and CSF biological data was involved. The final proposed algorithm allowed to identify pathogenic forms of AD according to the prevailing role of hyperphosphorylated tau or amyloid beta peptide.

21955321|t|Visualization of co-localization in Abeta42-administered neuroblastoma cells reveals lysosome damage and autophagosome accumulation related to cell death.
21955321|a|Abeta42 [amyloid-beta peptide-(1-42)] plays a central role in Alzheimer's disease and is known to have a detrimental effect on neuronal cell function and survival when assembled into an oligomeric form. In the present study we show that administration of freshly prepared Abeta42 oligomers to a neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cell line results in a reduction in survival, and that Abeta42 enters the cells prior to cell death. Immunoconfocal and immunogold electron microscopy reveal the path of the Abeta42 with time through the endosomal system and shows that it accumulates in lysosomes. A 24 h incubation with Abeta results in cells that have damaged lysosomes showing signs of enzyme leakage, accumulate autophagic vacuoles and exhibit severely disrupted nuclei. Endogenous Abeta is evident in the cells and the results of the present study suggest that the addition of Abeta oligomers disrupts a crucial balance in Abeta conformation and concentration inside neuronal cells, resulting in catastrophic effects on cellular function and, ultimately, in cell death.

21955816|t|Evaluation of plasma Abeta as predictor of Alzheimer's disease in older individuals without dementia: a population-based study.
21955816|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) pathology is a major component in the mechanisms behind Alzheimer's disease (AD). Measurement of Abeta(42) in cerebrospinal fluid predicts cognitive decline in patients with mild cognitive impairment and identifies AD in patients with dementia. However, studies on Abeta in plasma are contradictory. In this prospective population-based study, plasma Abeta(42) and Abeta(40) were measured at baseline in 730 adults aged 70 years or older and without dementia. After five years, plasma levels were analyzed again and participants were assessed for development of dementia. During follow-up, 53 individuals (7%) developed dementia of which 37 (5%) were classified as AD. No difference in baseline plasma Abeta(42), Abeta(40), or Abeta(42)/Abeta(40) ratio levels were observed between converters to dementia or AD compared to the cognitively stable individuals. However, individuals with plasma Abeta(40) levels above the median level for the group at baseline had an increased risk of developing dementia and AD during the follow-up, even after adjustment for age, gender, APOE genotype, and educational level (odds ratio = 2.2, 95% confidence interval = 1.0-4.7, p < 0.05). Neither plasma Abeta(42) nor the Abeta(42)/Abeta(40) ratio influenced the risk of developing dementia or AD. Moreover, Abeta(42) and Abeta(40) levels increased over the 5 years, whereas the Abeta(42)/Abeta(40) ratio decreased (p < 0.001). In conclusion, this study suggests that measurement of plasma Abeta should not be used clinically to predict dementia or AD. However, plasma Abeta(40) may possibly be regarded as a moderate risk marker comparable to other risk markers for AD such as first-degree family history of dementia.

21955818|t|Gantenerumab: a novel human anti-Abeta antibody demonstrates sustained cerebral amyloid-beta binding and elicits cell-mediated removal of human amyloid-beta.
21955818|a|The amyloid-beta lowering capacity of anti-Abeta antibodies has been demonstrated in transgenic models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in AD patients. While the mechanism of immunotherapeutic amyloid-beta removal is controversial, antibody-mediated sequestration of peripheral Abeta versus microglial phagocytic activity and disassembly of cerebral amyloid (or a combination thereof) has been proposed. For successful Abeta immunotherapy, we hypothesized that high affinity antibody binding to amyloid-beta plaques and recruitment of brain effector cells is required for most efficient amyloid clearance. Here we report the generation of a novel fully human anti-Abeta antibody, gantenerumab, optimized in vitro for binding with sub-nanomolar affinity to a conformational epitope expressed on amyloid-beta fibrils using HuCAL( ) phage display technologies. In peptide maps, both N-terminal and central portions of Abeta were recognized by gantenerumab. Remarkably, a novel orientation of N-terminal Abeta bound to the complementarity determining regions was identified by x-ray analysis of a gantenerumab Fab-Abeta(1-11) complex. In functional assays gantenerumab induced cellular phagocytosis of human amyloid-beta deposits in AD brain slices when co-cultured with primary human macrophages and neutralized oligomeric Abeta42-mediated inhibitory effects on long-term potentiation in rat brain. In APP751(swedish)xPS2(N141I) transgenic mice, gantenerumab showed sustained binding to cerebral amyloid-beta and, upon chronic treatment, significantly reduced small amyloid-beta plaques by recruiting microglia and prevented new plaque formation. Unlike other Abeta antibodies, gantenerumab did not alter plasma Abeta suggesting undisturbed systemic clearance of soluble Abeta. These studies demonstrated that gantenerumab preferentially interacts with aggregated Abeta in the brain and lowers amyloid-beta by eliciting effector cell-mediated clearance.

21958963|t|Interaction between NH(2)-tau fragment and Abeta in Alzheimer's disease mitochondria contributes to the synaptic deterioration.
21958963|a|Although amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide can promote tau pathology and its toxicity is concurrently tau-dependent, the underlying mechanisms of the in vivo interplay of these proteins remain unsolved. Structural and functional mitochondrial alterations play an early, precipitating role in synaptic failure of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis and an aggravated mitochondrial impairment has been described in triple APP/PS/tau transgenic mice carrying both plaques and tangles, if compared with mice overexpressing tau or amyloid precursor protein (APP) alone. Here, we show that a neurotoxic aminoterminal (NH(2))-derived tau fragment mapping between 26 and 230 amino acids of the human tau40 isoform (441 amino acids)-but not the physiological full-length protein-preferentially interacts with Abeta peptide(s) in human AD synapses in association with mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocator-1 (ANT-1) and cyclophilin D. The two peptides-Abeta 1-42 and the smaller and more potent NH(2)-26-44 peptide of the longest 20-22 kDa NH(2)-tau fragment-inhibit the ANT-1-dependent adenosine diphosphate-adenosine triphosphate (ADP/ATP) exchange in a noncompetitive and competitive manner, respectively, and together further aggravate the mitochondrial dysfunction by exacerbating the ANT-1 impairment. Taken together, these data establish a common, direct and synergistic toxicity of pathological APP and tau products on synaptic mitochondria and suggest potential, new pathway(s) and target(s) for a combined, more efficient therapeutic intervention of early synaptic dysfunction in AD.

21960299|t|Axonal transport of APP and the spatial regulation of APP cleavage and function in neuronal cells.
21960299|a|Over two decades have passed since the original discovery of amyloid precursor protein (APP). While physiological function(s) of APP still remain a matter of debate, consensus exists that the proteolytic processing of this protein represents a critical event in the life of neurons and that abnormalities in this process are instrumental in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Specific molecular components involved in APP proteolysis have been identified, and their enzymatic activities characterized in great detail. As specific proteolytic fragments of APP are identified and novel physiological effects for these fragments are revealed, more obvious becomes our need to understand the spatial organization of APP proteolysis. Valuable insights on this process have been obtained through the study of non-neuronal cells. However, much less is known about the topology of APP processing in neuronal cells, which are characterized by their remarkably complex cellular architecture and extreme degree of polarization. In this review, we discuss published literature addressing various molecular mechanisms and components involved in the trafficking and subcellular distribution of APP and APP secretases in neurons. These include the relevant machinery involved in their sorting, the identity of membranous organelles in which APP is transported, and the molecular motor-based mechanisms involved in their translocation. We also review experimental evidence specifically addressing the processing of APP at the axonal compartment. Understanding neuron-specific mechanisms of APP processing would help illuminating the physiological roles of APP-derived proteolytic fragments and provide novel insights on AD pathogenesis.

21968933|t|De novo induction of amyloid-beta deposition in vivo.
21968933|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of senile dementia, is associated to the build-up of misfolded amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the brain. Although compelling evidences indicate that the misfolding and oligomerization of Abeta is the triggering event in AD, the mechanisms responsible for the initiation of Abeta accumulation are unknown. In this study, we show that Abeta deposition can be induced by injection of AD brain extracts into animals, which, without exposure to this material, will never develop these alterations. The accumulation of Abeta deposits increased progressively with the time after inoculation, and the Abeta lesions were observed in brain areas far from the injection site. Our results suggest that some of the typical brain abnormalities associated with AD can be induced by a prion-like mechanism of disease transmission through propagation of protein misfolding. These findings may have broad implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for the initiation of AD, and may contribute to the development of new strategies for disease prevention and intervention.

21971403|t|Cerebrospinal fluid soluble amyloid-beta protein precursor as a potential novel biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease.
21971403|a|In this report, we confirm our previous findings of increased concentrations of soluble amyloid-beta protein precursor (sAbetaPP) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in a large cohort of patients (n = 314), not overlapping with those of our previous study, and we extend our observations by including a control group of participants with normal cognition. In addition, we investigate the effects of age, the APOEepsilon4 genotype, and the blood-CSF barrier function on the concentrations of sAbetaPPalpha and sAbetaPPbeta. The study participants were categorized according to clinical-neuropsychological criteria, supported by CSF neurochemical dementia diagnostics (NDD) analyses. sAbetaPPalpha concentrations in the AD group (132.0 +- 44.8) were significantly higher than in the control group (105.3 +- 37.3, p < 0.0005) but did not differ from the MCI-AD group (138.5 +- 39.5, p = 0.91). The MCI-AD group differed significantly from the MCI-O (97.3 +- 34.3, p < 0.05) group. There was no difference between the control and the MCI-O groups (p = 0.94). Similarly, sAbetaPPbeta concentrations in the AD group (160.2 +- 54.3) were significantly higher than in the control group (129.9 +- 44.6, p < 0.005) but did not differ from the MCI-AD group (184.0 +- 56.4, p = 0.20). The MCI-AD group differed significantly from the MCI-O (127.8 +- 46.2, p < 0.05) group. There was no difference between the control and the MCI-O groups (p > 0.99). We observed highly significant correlation of the two sAbetaPP forms. Age and the CSF-serum albumin ratio were significant albeit weak predictors of the sAbetaPPalpha and sAbetaPPbeta concentrations, while carrying the APOEepsilon4 allele did not influenced the levels of the sAbetaPP forms. Taken together, the results strongly suggest that CSF sAbetaPP concentrations may be considered as an extension of already available NDD tools.

21971406|t|High-intensity physical activity modulates diet effects on cerebrospinal amyloid-beta levels in normal aging and mild cognitive impairment.
21971406|a|We previously showed that amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta(42)) levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were markedly altered in response to a 4-week dietary intervention in normal aging and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Here, we re-examined the data to assess whether diet-induced effects on CSF Abeta(42) were modulated by high intensity physical activity (hi-PA). Normal older adults (n = 18, mean age = 68.6 +- 7.4 y) and adults with amnestic MCI (n = 23, mean age = 68.0 +- 6.5 y) received a low saturated fat/low glycemic index (LOW) diet or a high saturated fat/high glycemic index (HIGH) diet, and CSF levels of Abeta(42), tau, and IL-8 were measured at baseline and week 4. Pre-study activity levels were assessed using a 7-d questionnaire, and weekly duration of hi-PA was quantified. At baseline, increased hi-PA in normals predicted lower CSF levels of tau (r = -0.54, p = 0.020) and IL-8 (r = -0.70, p = 0.025). Diet-induced effects on CSF Abeta(42) during the intervention study were modulated by hi-PA, and the nature of this effect differed for normals and MCI (ANOVA, p = 0.039). That is, for normal adults, increased hi-PA attenuated the effects of the HIGH diet on CSF Abeta(42) whereas in MCI, increased hi-PA potentiated the effects of the LOW diet. Our results suggest that normal adults who engage in hi-PA are less vulnerable to the pathological effects of an unhealthy diet, while in MCI, the benefit of a healthy diet on Abeta modulation is greatest when paired with hi-PA. Exercise may thus interact with diet to alter pathological processes that ultimately modify risk of Alzheimer's disease.

21971579|t|Peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells derived from Alzheimer's disease patients show elevated baseline levels of secreted cytokines but resist stimulation with beta-amyloid peptide.
21971579|a|OBJECTIVES: Among several other factors, the neuro-toxic beta-amyloid peptide (betaAP)-induced inflammatory mechanisms have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's dementia (AD). Cytokines have recently emerged as prime candidates underlying this immune reaction. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the inflammatory response of peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells (PBMC) in AD. DESIGN: Cross-sectional (observational) study. SETTING: Behavioral and cognitive neurology clinic of the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: AD patients (n=19), healthy elderly (n=19) and young (n=14) individuals. MEASUREMENTS: Cytokine levels were assessed by enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA) after exposing cells to a broad range of betaAP concentrations (10(-4)-10(-10)M) as a stimulus. AD samples were weighed against leukocytes harvested from non-demented young and elderly subjects. RESULTS: Cytokine production of PBMCs in the youth was characterized by low baseline levels when compared to cells from the older generation. In the aging population, AD cells were distinguished from the healthy elderly sub-group by an even higher basal cytokine secretion. The low resting concentration in young individuals was markedly increased after treatment with betaAP, however cells from the elderly, irrespective of their disease status, showed unchanged cytokine release following betaAP administration. Non-specific activation of PBMCs with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies resulted in elevated interleukin (IL)-1beta concentrations in AD. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate a general over-production of cytokines and resistance to betaAP in the old comparison group, with a more pronounced disruption/boosted pattern in AD. Our findings are in line with the hypothesis of "inflammaging", i.e. an enhanced inflammatory profile with normal aging and a further perturbed environment in AD. The observed cytokine profiles may serve as diagnostic biomarkers in dementia.

21987394|t|Mechanism of amyloid removal in patients with Alzheimer disease treated with gantenerumab.
21987394|a|BACKGROUND: Gantenerumab is a fully human anti-Abeta monoclonal antibody in clinical development for the treatment of Alzheimer disease (AD). OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether treatment with gantenerumab leads to a measurable reduction in the level of Abeta amyloid in the brain and to elucidate the mechanism of amyloid reduction. DESIGN: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending-dose positron emission tomographic study. Additionally, ex vivo studies of human brain slices from an independent sample of patients who had AD were performed. SETTING: Three university medical centers. PATIENTS: Patients with mild-to-moderate AD. INTERVENTION: Two consecutive cohorts of patients received 2 to 7 infusions of intravenous gantenerumab (60 or 200 mg) or placebo every 4 weeks. Brain slices from patients who had AD were coincubated with gantenerumab at increasing concentrations and with human microglial cells. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Percent change in the ratio of regional carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B retention in vivo and semiquantitative assessment of gantenerumab-induced phagocytosis ex vivo. RESULTS: Sixteen patients with end-of-treatment positron emission tomographic scans were included in the analysis. The mean (95% CI) percent change from baseline difference relative to placebo (n = 4) in cortical brain amyloid level was -15.6% (95% CI, -42.7 to 11.6) for the 60-mg group (n = 6) and -35.7% (95% CI, -63.5 to -7.9) for the 200-mg group (n = 6). Two patients in the 200-mg group showed transient and focal areas of inflammation or vasogenic edema on magnetic resonance imaging scans at sites with the highest level of amyloid reduction. Gantenerumab induced phagocytosis of human amyloid in a dose-dependent manner ex vivo. CONCLUSION: Gantenerumab treatment resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in brain amyloid level, possibly through an effector cell-mediated mechanism of action.

21987591|t|Amyloid-beta and the failure to form mitochondrial cristae: a biomimetic study involving artificial membranes.
21987591|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative disease of the central nervous system which causes irreversible damage to neuron structure and function. The main hypothesis concerning the cause of AD is excessive accumulation of amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta). There has recently been a surge in studies on neuronal morphological and functional pathologies related to Abeta-induced mitochondrial dysfunctions and morphological alternations. What is the relation between the accumulation of Abeta in mitochondria, decreased production of ATP, and the large number of mitochondria with broken or scarce cristae observed in AD patients' neurons? The problem is complex, as it is now widely recognized that mitochondria function determines mitochondrial inner membrane (IM) morphology and, conversely, that IM morphology can influence mitochondrial functions. In our previous work, we designed an artificial mitochondrial IM, a minimal model system (giant unilamellar vesicle) mimicking the IM. We showed experimentally that modulation of the local pH gradient at the membrane level of cardiolipin-containing vesicles induces dynamic membrane invaginations similar to the mitochondrial cristae. In the present work we show, using our artificial IM, that Abeta renders the membrane unable to support the formation of cristae-like structures when local pH gradient occurs, leading to the failure of this cristae-like morphology. Fluorescent probe studies suggest that the dramatic change of membrane mechanical properties is due to Abeta-induced lipid bilayer dehydration, increased ordering of lipids, loss of membrane fluidity, and possibly to Abeta-induced changes in dynamic friction between the two leaflets of the lipid membrane.

21989385|t|Quantitative modelling of amyloidogenic processing and its influence by SORLA in Alzheimer's disease.
21989385|a|The extent of proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) into neurotoxic amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides is central to the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Accordingly, modifiers that increase Abeta production rates are risk factors in the sporadic form of AD. In a novel systems biology approach, we combined quantitative biochemical studies with mathematical modelling to establish a kinetic model of amyloidogenic processing, and to evaluate the influence by SORLA/SORL1, an inhibitor of APP processing and important genetic risk factor. Contrary to previous hypotheses, our studies demonstrate that secretases represent allosteric enzymes that require cooperativity by APP oligomerization for efficient processing. Cooperativity enables swift adaptive changes in secretase activity with even small alterations in APP concentration. We also show that SORLA prevents APP oligomerization both in cultured cells and in the brain in vivo, eliminating the preferred form of the substrate and causing secretases to switch to a less efficient non-allosteric mode of action. These data represent the first mathematical description of the contribution of genetic risk factors to AD substantiating the relevance of subtle changes in SORLA levels for amyloidogenic processing as proposed for patients carrying SORL1 risk alleles.

21993310|t|S14G-humanin improves cognitive deficits and reduces amyloid pathology in the middle-aged APPswe/PS1dE9 mice.
21993310|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by clinical cognitive decline and pathological deposition of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) in the brain. So far, there has been no causative therapy for this devastating disease. S14G-Humanin (HNG), a synthetic derivative of Humanin (HN), has been shown to have strong neuroprotective ability against AD-related insults in vitro and prevent cognitive impairments in Abeta-infused animal models. In addition, a recent study has reported a beneficial effect of intranasal HNG treatment on memory deficit and Abeta accumulation in triple transgenic (3xTg-AD) mice at the early plaque-bearing stage. However, whether HNG treatment has the disease-modifying efficacy on AD with pre-existing well-established amyloid plaque pathology remains unclear. In this study, we employed 9-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 mice with pre-existing robust amyloid plaque pathology to investigate the effects of chronic HNG treatment on the progression of cognitive dysfunction and Abeta-associated neuropathology. We found that vehicle-treated APPswe/PS1dE9 mice showed impaired spatial learning and memory compared with vehicle- and HNG-treated wild-type mice, while intraperitoneal HNG treatment for 3 months significantly improved spatial learning and memory deficits in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice compared with vehicle control treatment. Coincidental with this, HNG treatment significantly reduced cerebral Abeta plaque deposition, insoluble Abeta levels, and neuroinflammatory responses in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice compared with control treatment. Cumulatively, these findings demonstrate that chronic administration of HNG is able to attenuate cognitive deficits and reduce Abeta loads as well as neuroinflammation in the middle-aged APPswe/PS1dE9 mice even with pre-existing substantial Abeta neuropathology, indicating that HNG has potential as a pharmacotherapeutic intervention in the development of cognitive deficits and neuropathology seen in the cases of established AD.

21995332|t|Inhibition of amyloid peptide fragment Abeta25-35 fibrillogenesis and toxicity by N-terminal beta-amino acid-containing esapeptides: is taurine moiety essential for in vivo effects?
21995332|a|We report the synthesis and fibrillogenesis inhibiting activity of the new peptide derivatives 1-4, related to the pentapeptide Ac-LPFFD-NH(2)  (iAbeta5p), proposed by Soto and co-workers and widely recognized as one of the most active beta-sheet breaker agents. The Abeta(25-35)  fragment of the parent full-length Abeta(1-42)  was used as fibrillogenesis model. The activity of peptide derivatives 1-4 was tested in vitro by thioflavin T binding assay, far UV CD spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. Their ability to hinder the toxic effect of Abeta(25-35) in vivo was studied by monitoring the viability of human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and the prevention of superoxide anion radical release from BV2 microglial cells. The results point to a favourable role in the fibrillogenesis inhibitory activity of the sulphonamide junction for compounds 1 and 2, containing an N,N-dimethyltaurine and a taurine amino-terminal moiety, respectively. Furthermore, compounds 1 and 2 show a significant protective effect on cell viability, rescuing the cells from the toxicity exerted by Abeta(25-35)  treatment.

21999410|t|Novel antibody capture assay for paraffin-embedded tissue detects wide-ranging amyloid beta and paired helical filament-tau accumulation in cognitively normal older adults.
21999410|a|Quantifying antigens in formalin-fixed tissue is challenging and limits investigation in population-based studies of brain aging. To address this major limitation, we have developed a new technique that we call "Histelide": immunohistochemistry (HIST-) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (-EL-) performed on a glass slide (-IDE). We validated Histelide in sections of prefrontal cortex from 20 selected cases: 12 subjects with clinically and neuropathologically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (AD), either autosomal dominant or late-onset forms, and 8 clinical and neuropathologic controls. AD cases had significantly increased amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide and paired helical filament- (PHF-) tau per area of neocortex that was proteinase K-sensitive, and significantly decreased amount of synaptophysin. We next investigated prefrontal cortex from 81 consecutive cases of high-cognitive performers from the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study, a population-based study of brain aging and incident dementia. As expected, latent AD was common in this group; however, our results quantified widely individually varying levels of Abeta peptides and PHF-tau among these high-cognitive performers. This novel approach obtains quantitative data from population-based studies, and our initial studies with high-cognitive performers provide important quantitative insights into latent AD that should help guide expectations from neuroimaging and prevention studies.

22002568|t|Huperzine A alleviates synaptic deficits and modulates amyloidogenic and nonamyloidogenic pathways in APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice.
22002568|a|Huperzine A (HupA) is a potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, HupA was shown to be active in modulating the nonamyloidogenic metabolism of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) in APP-transfected human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293swe). However, in vivo research concerning the mechanism of HupA in APP transgenic mice has not yet been fully elucidated. The present study indicates that the loss of dendritic spine density and synaptotagmin levels in the brain of APPswe/presenilin-1 (PS1) transgenic mice was significantly ameliorated by chronic HupA treatment and provides evidence that this neuroprotection was associated with reduced amyloid plaque burden and oligomeric beta-amyloid (Abeta) levels in the cortex and hippocampus of APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice. Our findings further demonstrate that the amelioration effect of HupA on Abeta deposits may be mediated, at least in part, by regulation of the compromised expression of a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10) and excessive membrane trafficking of beta-site APP cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE1) in these transgenic mice. In addition, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (Erk1/2) phosphorylation may also be partially involved in the effect of HupA on APP processing. In conclusion, our work for the first time demonstrates the neuroprotective effect of HupA on synaptic deficits in APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice and further clarifies the potential pharmacological targets for this protective effect, in which modulation of nonamyloidogenic and amyloidogenic APP processing pathways may be both involved. These findings may provide adequate evidence for the clinical and experimental benefits gained from HupA treatment.

22006270|t|The role of APP and APLP for synaptic transmission, plasticity, and network function: lessons from genetic mouse models.
22006270|a|APP, APLP1, and APLP2 form a family of mammalian membrane proteins with unknown function. APP, however, plays a key role in the molecular pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), indicating that it is somehow involved in synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, memory formation, and maintenance of neurons. At present, most of our knowledge about the function of APP comes from consequences of AD-related mutations. The native role of APP, and even more of APLP1/2, remains largely unknown. New genetic knockout and knockin models involving several members of the APP/APLP family may yield better insight into the synaptic and systemic functions of these proteins. Here, we summarize recent results from such transgenic animals with special emphasis on synaptic plasticity and coherent patterns of memory-related network activity in the hippocampus. Data from APP knockout mice suggest that this protein is needed for the expression of long-term potentiation (LTP) in aged, but not in juvenile mice. The missing function can be rescued by expressing part of the protein, as well as by blocking inhibition. Double knockout mice lacking APP and APLP2 die shortly after birth indicating that different members of the APP/APLP family can mutually compensate for genetic ablation of single proteins. Recent techniques allow for analysis of tissue with combined defects, e.g., by expressing only part of APP in APLP2 knockout mice or by growing stem cells with multiple deletions on normal slice cultures. Data from these experiments confirm that APP and APLP2 do indeed play an important role in synaptic plasticity. Much less is known about the role of APP/APLP at the network level. Coherent patterns of activity like hippocampal network oscillations are believed to support formation and consolidation of memory. Analysis of such activity patterns in tissue from mice with altered expression of APP/APLP has just started and may shed further light on the importance of these proteins for cognitive functions.

22009041|t|Association between frontal cortex oxidative damage and beta-amyloid as a function of age in Down syndrome.
22009041|a|Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability in children, and the number of adults with DS reaching old age is increasing. By the age of 40 years, virtually all people with DS have sufficient neuropathology for a postmortem diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD). Trisomy 21 in DS leads to an overexpression of many proteins, of which at least two are involved in oxidative stress and AD: superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and amyloid precursor protein (APP). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that DS brains with neuropathological hallmarks of AD have more oxidative and nitrosative stress than those with DS but without significant AD pathology, as compared with similarly aged-matched non-DS controls. The frontal cortex was examined in 70 autopsy cases (n=29 control and n=41 DS). By ELISA, we quantified soluble and insoluble Abeta40 and Abeta42, as well as oligomers. Oxidative and nitrosative stress levels (protein carbonyls, 4-hydroxy-2-trans-nonenal (HNE)-bound proteins, and 3-nitrotyrosine) were measured by slot-blot. We found that soluble and insoluble amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) and oligomers increase as a function of age in DS frontal cortex. Of the oxidative stress markers, HNE-bound proteins were increased overall in DS. Protein carbonyls were correlated with Abeta40 levels. These results suggest that oxidative damage, but not nitrosative stress, may contribute to the onset and progression of AD pathogenesis in DS. Conceivably, treatment with antioxidants may provide a point of intervention to slow pathological alterations in DS.

22014620|t|Early development of social deficits in APP and APP-PS1 mice.
22014620|a|Mimicking relevant behavioral features of the human pathology is one of the most important challenges for animal models of neurological disorders including Alzheimer disease (AD). Indeed, the most popular genetic AD mouse lines bearing mutations of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 genes (PS1), often fail to present robust cognitive deficits or show them only at very advanced ages. It is therefore crucial to identify AD-like behavioral alterations which may reliably reflect the early stages of the pathology, thus permitting tests of more efficient early therapeutic interventions. Here, we demonstrated the very early expression of noncognitive AD-like symptoms, i.e., deficits in social interest, interaction and communication, in APP and APP-PS1 transgenic mice. Conversely, other noncognitive behaviors (sensori-motor gating) as well as cognitive abilities (spontaneous alternation) were unaltered in AD transgenics. Our data suggest that social deficits precede other neuropsychiatric and cognitive AD-like symptoms and can be employed as early markers of AD pathology in genetic mouse models.

22015470|t|Multi-faced neuroprotective effects of Ginsenoside Rg1 in an Alzheimer mouse model.
22015470|a|There has been no extensive characterization of the effects of Ginsenoside Rg1, a pharmacological active component purified from the nature product ginseng, in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model. The well-characterized transgenic Alzheimer disease (AD) mice over expressing amyloid precursor protein (APP)/Abeta (Tg mAPP) and nontransgenic (nonTg) littermates at age of 6 and 9 months were treated with Rg 1 for three months via intraperitoneal injection. Mice were then evaluated for changes in amyloid pathology, neuropathology and behavior. Tg mAPP treated with Rg1 showed a significant reduction of cerebral Abeta levels, reversal of certain neuropathological changes, and preservation of spatial learning and memory, as compared to vehicle-treated mice. Rg1 treatment inhibited activity of gamma-secretase in both Tg mAPP mice and B103-APP cells, indicating the involvement of Rg1 in APP regulation pathway. Furthermore, administration of Rg1 enhanced PKA/CREB pathway activation in mAPP mice and in cultured cortical neurons exposed to Abeta or glutamate-mediated synaptic stress. Most importantly, the beneficial effects on attenuation of cerebral Abeta accumulation, improvement in neuropathological and behavioral changes can be extended to the aged mAPP mice, even to 12-13 months old mice that had extensive amyloid pathology and severe neuropathological and cognitive malfunction. These studies indicate that Rg1 has profound multi-faced and neuroprotective effects in an AD mouse model. Rg1 induces neuroprotection through ameliorating amyloid pathology, modulating APP process, improving cognition, and activating PKA/CREB signaling. These findings provide a new perspective for the treatment of AD and demonstrate potential for a new class of drugs for AD treatment.

22015609|t|Soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1 secreted by human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cell reduces amyloid-beta plaques.
22015609|a|Presently, co-culture of human umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB-MSCs) with BV2 microglia under amyloid-beta42 (Abeta42) exposure induced a reduction of Abeta42 in the medium as well as an overexpression of the Abeta-degrading enzyme neprilysin (NEP) in microglia. Cytokine array examinations of co-cultured media revealed elevated release of soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) from hUCB-MSCs. Administration of human recombinant ICAM-1 in BV2 cells and wild-type mice brains induced NEP expression in time- and dose-dependent manners. In co-culturing with BV2 cells under Abeta42 exposure, knockdown of ICAM-1 expression on hUCB-MSCs by small interfering RNA (siRNA) abolished the induction of NEP in BV2 cells as well as reduction of added Abeta42 in the co-cultured media. By contrast, siRNA-mediated inhibition of the sICAM-1 receptor, lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), on BV2 cells reduced NEP expression by ICAM-1 exposure. When hUCB-MSCs were transplanted into the hippocampus of a 10-month-old transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease for 10, 20, or 40 days, NEP expression was increased in the mice brains. Moreover, Abeta42 plaques in the hippocampus and other regions were decreased by active migration of hUCB-MSCs toward Abeta deposits. These data suggest that hUCB-MSC-derived sICAM-1 decreases Abeta plaques by inducing NEP expression in microglia through the sICAM-1/LFA-1 signaling pathway.

22017494|t|Exogenous seeding of cerebral beta-amyloid deposition in betaAPP-transgenic rats.
22017494|a|Deposition of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide in senile plaques and cerebral Abeta angiopathy (CAA) can be stimulated in Abeta-precursor protein (APP)-transgenic mice by the intracerebral injection of dilute brain extracts containing aggregated Abeta seeds. Growing evidence implicates a prion-like mechanism of corruptive protein templating in this phenomenon, in which aggregated Abeta itself is the seed. Unlike prion disease, which can be induced de novo in animals that are unlikely to spontaneously develop the disease, previous experiments with Abeta seeding have employed animal models that, as they age, eventually will generate Abeta lesions in the absence of seeding. In the present study, we first established that a transgenic rat model expressing human APP (APP21 line) does not manifest endogenous deposits of Abeta within the course of its median lifespan (30 months). Next, we injected 3-month-old APP21 rats intrahippocampally with dilute Alzheimer brain extracts containing aggregated Abeta. After a 9-month incubation period, these rats had developed senile plaques and CAA in the injected hippocampus, whereas control rats remained free of such lesions. These findings underscore the co-dependence of agent and host in governing seeded protein aggregation, and show that cerebral Abeta-amyloidosis can be induced even in animals that are relatively refractory to the spontaneous origination of parenchymal and vascular deposits of Abeta.

22019329|t|High throughput object-based image analysis of beta-amyloid plaques in human and transgenic mouse brain.
22019329|a|Advances in imaging technology have enabled automated approaches for quantitative image analysis. In this study, a high content object based image analysis method was developed for quantification of beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques in postmortem brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects and in transgenic mice over overexpressing Abeta. Digital images acquired from immunohistochemically stained sections of the superior frontal gyrus were analyzed for Abeta plaque burden using a Definiens object-based segmentation approach. Blinded evaluation of Abeta stained sections from AD and aged matched human subjects accurately identified AD cases with one exception. Brains from transgenic mice overexpressing Abeta (PS1APP mice) were also evaluated by our Definiens object based image analysis approach. We observed an age-dependent increase in the amount of Abeta plaque load that we quantified in both the hippocampus and cortex. From the contralateral hemisphere, we measured the amount of Abeta in brain homogenates biochemically and observed a significant correlation between our biochemical measurements and those that we measured by our object based Definiens system in the hippocampus. Assessment of Abeta plaque load in PS1APP mice using a manual segmentation technique (Image-Pro Plus) confirmed the results of our object-based image analysis approach. Image acquisition and analysis of 32 stained human slides and 100 mouse slides were executed in 8 h and 22 h, respectively supporting the relatively high throughput features of the Definiens platform. The data show that digital imaging combined with object based image analysis is a reliable and efficient approach to quantifying Abeta plaques in human and mouse brain.

22020632|t|Apolipoprotein E level and cholesterol are associated with reduced synaptic amyloid beta in Alzheimer's disease and apoE TR mouse cortex.
22020632|a|The apolipoprotein E4 allele (APOE4) contributes to Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk and APOE2 is protective, but the relevant cellular mechanisms are unknown. We have used flow cytometry analysis to measure apolipoprotein E (apoE) and amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) levels in large populations of synaptic terminals from AD and aged cognitively normal controls, and demonstrate that modest but significant increases in soluble apoE levels accompany elevated Abeta in AD cortical synapses and in an APP/PS1 rat model of AD. Dual labeling experiments document co-localization of apoE and Abeta in individual synapses with concentration of Abeta in a small population of apoE-positive synapses in both AD and controls. Consistent with a clearance role, the apoE level was higher in Abeta-positive synapses in control cases. In aged targeted replacement mice expressing human apoE, apoE2/4 synaptic terminals demonstrated the highest level of apoE and the lowest level of Abeta compared to apoE3/3 and apoE4/4 lines. In apoE2/4 terminals, the pattern of immunolabeling for apoE and Abeta closely resembled the pattern in human control cases, and elevated apoE was accompanied by elevated free cholesterol in apoE2/4 synaptic terminals. These results are consistent with a role for APOE in Abeta clearance in AD synapses, and suggest that optimal lipidation of apoE2 compared to E3 and E4 makes an important contribution to Abeta clearance and synaptic function.

22023354|t|Measurement of Abeta1-42 in cerebrospinal fluid is influenced by matrix effects.
22023354|a|Abeta1-42 measurement in CSF is an important biochemical marker for Alzheimer disease (AD). However, our understanding of why this biomarker is predictive and why it is often difficult to measure in a reproducible fashion is still lacking. To study these questions, the concentration of Abeta1-42 in CSF was compared before and after denaturation with 6M guanidine and reverse-phase HPLC. Measurement of the Abeta1-42 after denaturation and reverse-phase HPLC demonstrated that considerably more Abeta1-42 was present in CSF than revealed when assaying non-denatured CSF. A comparison of Abeta1-42 concentrations before and after HPLC in AD CSF with that in normal controls suggested that matrix interference may affect the differentiation between the diagnostic groups. A similar effect was observed with dilutions of crude CSF. Together, these results suggested that at least part of the mechanism by which low Abeta1-42 concentrations in CSF function as a biomarker of AD is related to matrix components which preferentially hide a portion of the Abeta1-42 from detection in AD CSF. In contrast, we show that the association of the APOEepsilon4 allele with lower Abeta1-42 concentrations in CSF is preserved even after denaturation and HPLC. A similar relationship between the presence of the APOEepsilon4 allele and lower concentrations of Abeta1-40 was also apparent, thereby generating similar ratios of Abeta1-42/ Abeta1-40 across the APOE genotypes. The results from the present study suggested that Abeta1-42 in CSF functions as a biomarker of AD in tandem with other CSF matrix components that are increased in AD CSF. Further studies are needed to identify which matrix factors (e.g. binding of Abeta to proteins) underlie the increased detection of Abeta1-42 concentrations after denaturation and HPLC. The data also suggested that denaturation and HPLC of CSF may be a useful approach for studies using Abeta1-42 as a pharmacodynamic marker or in other paradigms where measurement of total non-covalently bound Abeta1-42 is required.

22027013|t|Genetic analysis of genes involved in amyloid-beta degradation and clearance in Alzheimer's disease.
22027013|a|Accumulation of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients has been postulated to reflect defects in Abeta degradation or clearance. Here, we selected 12 genes (MMEL1, ECE1, ECE2, AGER, PLG, PLAT, NR1H3, MMP3, LRP1, TTR, NR1H2, and MMP9) involved in Abeta catabolism on the basis of PubMed-based literature search and elucidated their genetic role in AD among Finnish case-control cohort consisting of total ~1,300 AD patients and control subjects. Thirty one single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected for genotyping. In a smaller subset of AD patients, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of Abeta42 (n = 124), total-tau (n = 59), and phospho-tau (n = 54) analyses were performed with respect to SNPs. Moreover, age of onset analyses with respect to the studied SNPs were conducted among the AD patient cohort (n = 642). Association analysis of the liver X receptor alpha (NR1H3) gene SNPs showed a protective effect for C allele carriers of rs7120118 (OR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.53-0.93), while the total-tau and phospho-tau levels in CSF were decreased in AD patients carrying the C allele. Also, a decrease in the age of onset was observed in AD patients carrying the A allele of rs723744 and the C allele of rs3794884 in transthyretin (TTR) gene. However, after adjusting the p-values for multiple comparisons, these results were not statistically significant, suggesting that genetic variations in MMEL1, ECE1, ECE2, AGER, PLG, PLAT, NR1H3, MMP3, LRP1, TTR, NR1H2, and MMP9 genes do not play major role among the Finnish AD patient cohort.

22035227|t|Gamma-secretase modulators do not induce Abeta-rebound and accumulation of beta-C-terminal fragment.
22035227|a|gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) have been developed to reduce amyloid-beta (Abeta) production for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease by inhibiting the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP). However, cross-inhibitory activity on the processing of Notch can cause adverse reactions. To avoid these undesirable effects, gamma-secretase modulators (GSMs) are being developed to selectively reduce toxic Abeta production without perturbing Notch signaling. As it is also known that GSIs can cause a paradoxical increase of plasma Abeta over the baseline after a transient reduction (known as Abeta-rebound), we asked if GSMs would cause a similar rebound and what the potential mechanism might be. Our studies were performed with one GSI (LY-450139) and two chemically distinct GSMs. Although LY-450139 caused Abeta-rebound as expected in rat plasma, the two GSMs did not. Inhibition of APP processing by LY-450139 induced an accumulation of gamma-secretase substrates, alpha- and beta-C-terminal fragments of APP, but neither GSM caused such an accumulation. In conclusion, we discover that GSMs, unlike GSIs, do not cause Abeta-rebound, possibly because of the lack of accumulation of beta-C-terminal fragments. GSMs may be superior to GSIs in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease not only by sparing Notch signaling but also by avoiding Abeta-rebound.

22035591|t|Glycosaminoglycans from aged human hippocampus have altered capacities to regulate trophic factors activities but not Abeta42 peptide toxicity.
22035591|a|Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are major extracellular matrix components known to tightly regulate cell behavior by interacting with tissue effectors as trophic factors and other heparin binding proteins. Alterations of GAGs structures might thus modify the nature and extent of these interactions and alter tissue integrity. Here, we studied levels and composition of GAGs isolated from adult and aged human hippocampus and investigated if their changes can influence the function of important trophic factors and the Abeta42 peptide toxicity. Biochemical analyses showed that heparan sulfates are increased in the aged hippocampus. Moreover, GAGs from aged hippocampus showed altered capacities to regulate trophic factor activities without changing their capacities to protect cells from Abeta42 toxicity, compared to adult hippocampus GAGs. Structural alterations in GAGs from elderly were suggested by differential transcripts levels of key biosynthetic enzymes. C5-epimerase and 2-OST expressions were decreased while NDST-2 and 3-OST-4 were increased; in contrast, heparanase expression was unchanged. Results suggest that alteration of GAGs in hippocampus of aged subjects could participate to tissue impairment during aging.

22036964|t|Notch signaling proteins HES-1 and Hey-1 bind to insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) proximal promoter and repress its transcription and activity: implications for cellular Abeta metabolism.
22036964|a|Cerebral amyloid beta (Abeta) accumulation is pathogenically associated with sporadic Alzheimer's disease (SAD). BACE-1 is involved in Abeta generation while insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) partakes in Abeta proteolytic clearance. Vulnerable regions in AD brains show increased BACE-1 protein levels and enzymatic activity while the opposite occurs with IDE. Another common feature in SAD brains is Notch1 overexpression. Here we demonstrate an increase in mRNA levels of Hey-1, a Notch target gene, and a decrease of IDE transcripts in the hippocampus of SAD brains as compared to controls. Transient transfection of Notch intracellular domain (NICD) in N2aSW cells, mouse neuroblastoma cells (N2a) stably expressing human amyloid precursor protein (APP) Swedish mutation, reduce IDE mRNA levels, promoting extracellular Abeta accumulation. Also, NICD, HES-1 and Hey-1 overexpression result in decreased IDE proximal promoter activity. This effect was mediated by 2 functional sites located at -379/-372 and -310-303 from the first translation start site in the -575/-19 (556 bp) fragment of IDE proximal promoter. By site-directed mutagenesis of the IDE promoter region we reverted the inhibitory effect mediated by NICD transfection suggesting that these sites are indeed responsible for the Notch-mediated inhibition of the IDE gene expression. Intracranial injection of the Notch ligand JAG-1 in Tg2576 mice, expressing the Swedish mutation in human APP, induced overexpression of HES-1 and Hey-1 and reduction of IDE mRNA levels, respectively. Our results support our theory that a Notch-dependent IDE transcriptional modulation may impact on Abeta metabolism providing a functional link between Notch signaling and the amyloidogenic pathway in SAD.

22037136|t|Transient increase of plasma concentrations of amyloid beta peptides after electroconvulsive therapy.
22037136|a|BACKGROUND: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is applied to effectively treat depressive episodes, and it can be considered an ideal model of generalized seizures induced and performed under precisely controllable conditions. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesize that ECT causes a transiently increased blood-brain barrier permeability. METHODS: We measured plasma concentrations of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides: 1-42, 1-40, x-42, and x-40 before ECT, within 30 minutes after 2, and 24 hours after ECT treatment in 33-36 sessions of n=13 different patients. RESULTS: We observed a significant increase of the plasma concentrations of all four peptides within 30 minutes after the ECT, followed by the normalization of the peptides concentrations 2 hours after the ECT. CONCLUSION: Different physiologic phenomena may be responsible for the transient increase of the Abeta peptides concentrations in plasma shortly after ECT session, and further studies are necessary to explain these mechanisms. For example, decreased integrity of the blood-brain barrier permeability, an increased release from neurons due to their activation or increased release from peripheral sources, like thrombocytes or muscles, or a combination of different factors must be taken into consideration.

22038715|t|Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism to study APP function.
22038715|a|The brains of Alzheimer's disease patients show an increased number of senile plaques compared with normal patients. The major component of the plaques is the beta-amyloid peptide, a cleavage product of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Although the processing of APP has been well-described, the physiological functions of APP and its cleavage products remain unclear. This article reviews the multifunctional roles of an APP orthologue, the C. elegans APL-1. Understanding the function of APL-1 may provide insights into the functions and signaling pathways of human APP. In addition, the physiological effects of introducing human beta-amyloid peptide into C. elegans are also reviewed. The C. elegans system provides a powerful genetic model to identify genes regulating the molecular mechanisms underlying intracellular beta-amyloid peptide accumulation.

22038908|t|CSF biomarker and PIB-PET-derived beta-amyloid signature predicts metabolic, gray matter, and cognitive changes in nondemented subjects.
22038908|a|Beta-amyloid (Abeta) is a histopathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease dementia, but high levels of Abeta in the brain can also be found in a substantial proportion of nondemented subjects. Here we investigated which 2-year rate of brain and cognitive changes are present in nondemented subjects with high and low Abeta levels, as assessed with cerebrospinal fluid and molecular positron emission tomography (PET)-based biomarkers of Abeta. In subjects with mild cognitive impairment, increased brain Abeta levels were associated with significantly faster cognitive decline, progression of gray matter atrophy within temporal and parietal brain regions, and a trend for a faster decline in parietal Fludeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET metabolism. Changes in gray matter and FDG-PET mediated the association between Abeta and cognitive decline. In contrast, elderly cognitively healthy controls (HC) with high Abeta levels showed only a faster medial temporal lobe and precuneus volume decline compared with HC with low Abeta. In conclusion, the current results suggest not only that both functional and volumetric brain changes are associated with high Abeta years before the onset of dementia but also that HC with substantial Abeta levels show higher Abeta pathology resistance, lack other pathologies that condition neurotoxic effects of Abeta, or accumulated Abeta for a shorter time period.

22045115|t|Aluminium, iron and copper in human brain tissues donated to the Medical Research Council's Cognitive Function and Ageing Study.
22045115|a|Aluminium, iron and copper are all implicated in the aetiology of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease. However, there are very few large cohort studies of the content of these metals in aged human brains. We have used microwave digestion and TH GFAAS to measure aluminium, iron and copper in the temporal, frontal, occipital and parietal lobes of 60 brains donated to the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study. Every precaution was taken to reduce contamination of samples and acid digests to a minimum. Actual contamination was estimated by preparing a large number of (170+) method blanks which were interspersed within the full set of 700+ tissue digests. Subtraction of method blank values (MBV) from tissue digest values resulted in metal contents in all tissues in the range, MBV to 33 mug g(-1) dry wt. for aluminium, 112 to 8305 mug g(-1) dry wt. for iron and MBV to 384 mug g(-1) dry wt. for copper. While the median aluminium content for all tissues was 1.02 mug g(-1) dry wt. it was informative that 41 brains out of 60 included at least one tissue with an aluminium content which could be considered as potentially pathological (> 3.50 mug g(-1) dry wt.). The median content for iron was 286.16 mug g(-1) dry wt. and overall tissue iron contents were generally high which possibly reflected increased brain iron in ageing and in neurodegenerative disease. The median content for copper was 17.41 mug g(-1) dry wt. and overall tissue copper contents were lower than expected for aged brains but they were commensurate with aged brains showing signs of neurodegenerative disease. In this study we have shown, in particular, the value of carrying out significant numbers of method blanks to identify unknown sources of contamination. When these values are subtracted from tissue digest values the absolute metal contents could be considered as conservative and yet they may still reflect aspects of ageing and neurodegenerative disease in individual brains.

22045482|t|Chronic mild stress accelerates the onset and progression of the Alzheimer's disease phenotype in Tg2576 mice.
22045482|a|The etiology of the more common (sporadic) forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unknown, although age is the most important risk factor. Nevertheless, interactions between environmental risk factors and genetic background may also influence the onset and progression of sporadic AD. Chronic stress, associated with altered memory and other neurological processes, is thought to influence the pathogenesis of AD. Hence, we evaluated the effect of unpredictable and consecutive chronic mild stressors on the onset of an AD-related pathology in the Tg2576 mouse line that overexpresses the human amyloid-beta protein precursor with the Swedish mutation (hAbetaPP(Swe)). Two months after exposure to chronic mild stress, 4 month-old animals that normally display no pathological features of AD, not only expressed pathological markers but also experienced cognitive dysfunction in the Morris water maze test. These findings suggest that chronic mild stress accelerates the onset of cognitive impairment and produces an increase in hippocampal amyloid-beta and phospho-tau levels on a background of AD susceptibility.

22045484|t|The BACE1-PSEN-AbetaPP regulatory axis has an ancient role in response to low oxygen/oxidative stress.
22045484|a|Oxygen homeostasis is essential for the development and normal physiology of an organism. Hypoxia causes the mitochondrial electron transport chain to generate higher levels of reactive oxygen species resulting in oxidative stress. Hypoxia can be a direct consequence of hypoperfusion, a common vascular component among Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk factors, and may play an important role in AD pathogenesis. Beta-site amyloid-beta A4 precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is responsible, with gamma-secretase, for cleavage of the amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) to produce amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide. A recent study observed that oxidative stress increases BACE1 expression via a regulatory pathway dependent on gamma-secretase cleavage of AbetaPP and this increases Abeta peptide production. Zebrafish embryos represent normal cells in which complex and subtle manipulations of gene activity can be performed to facilitate analysis of genes involved in human disease. Here we identify and describe the expression of bace1, the zebrafish ortholog of human BACE1. We observe that the zebrafish AD-related genes bace1, psen1, psen2, appa, and appb all show increased mRNA levels under hypoxia. A dominant negative form of psen1 putatively blocking gamma-secretase activity blocks bace1 upregulation under hypoxia. Hypoxia increases catalase gene mRNA indicating increased oxidative stress but we did not observe increased levels of F2-isoprostanes that indicate peroxidation of arachidonic acid, possibly due to relatively low levels of arachidonic acid in zebrafish. Our results demonstrate that upregulation of PSEN1 & 2, AbetaPP and the gamma-secretase-dependent upregulation of BACE1 is an ancient, conserved, and thus selectively advantageous response to hypoxia/oxidative stress.

22045485|t|Interrelations between CSF soluble AbetaPPbeta, amyloid-beta 1-42, SORL1, and tau levels in Alzheimer's disease.
22045485|a|Recently, light has been shed on possible interrelations between the two most important pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD): the amyloid cascade and axonal degeneration. In this study, we investigated associations between sbetaAPPbeta, a product of the cleavage of the amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) by beta-secretase, amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta42), soluble SORL1 (also called LR11 or SORLA), a receptor that is involved in AbetaPP processing, and the marker of axonal degeneration tau in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 76 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 61 patients with AD, and 17 patients with frontotemporal dementia, which neuropathologically is not related to the amyloid pathology. In the AD group, significant associations between sAbetaPPbeta, tau (p < 0.001), and soluble SORL1 (p < 0.001) were detected according to linear regression models. In patients with MCI, sAbetaPPbeta correlated significantly with tau (p < 0.001) and soluble SORL1 (p = 0.003). In the FTD group, only SORL1 (p = 0.011) was associated with sAbetaPPbeta and not tau. Abeta42 was found to be significantly related to tau levels in CSF in the MCI group (p < 0.001) and they tended to be associated in the AD group (p = 0.05). Our results provide further evidence for a link between the two facets of AD pathology, which is likely to be mediated by the binding of Abeta oligomers to specifically targeted neurons, resulting in stimulating tau hyperphosphorylation and neurodegeneration.

22045488|t|Amyloid-beta protein precursor gene expression in alzheimer's disease and other conditions.
22045488|a|Several lines of evidence suggest that AbetaPP gene expression could influence risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using a highly sensitive multiplex fluorescent RT-PCR assay, we compared peripheral blood cells expression of AbetaPP mRNA among sporadic AD patients (n = 133), autosomal dominant early-onset AD cases (ADEOAD, n = 21), Down syndrome patients (n = 21), AD patients with AbetaPP duplication (n = 9), patients with recent ischemic stroke (n = 25), and healthy controls (n = 58). Compared to healthy controls (median = 0.98), AbetaPP expression was not increased in sporadic AD patients (median = 1.01, p = 0.42) nor in ADEOAD patients (median = 0.96, p = 0.26). Down syndrome patients as well as patients with AbetaPP duplication had significantly increased levels of AbetaPP mRNA compared to controls (median = 1.48 and median = 1.36, p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0007, respectively). A weaker but significant increase in relative amount of AbetaPP transcripts in patients who suffered from recent stroke was observed (median = 1.14, p = 0.0007). Our results do not support a pathogenic role of AbetaPP overexpression in sporadic AD although a small subset of patients displays AbetaPP overexpression in the same range as Down syndrome patients.

22045490|t|Age-dependent and tissue-related glutathione redox status in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
22045490|a|Glutathione plays an essential role in the intracellular antioxidant defense against oxidant radicals, especially the  OH radical. To understand the early and progressive cellular changes in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), we investigated reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) status in a double mutated AD transgenic mouse model (B6.Cg-Tg), which carries Swedish amyloid-beta protein precursor mutation (AbetaPPswe) and exon 9 deletion of the PSEN1 gene. In this study, we quantified and compared both GSH/GSSG and mixed-disulfide (Pr-SSG) levels in blood samples and three anatomic positions in brain (cerebrum, cerebellum, and hippocampus) at 3 age stages (1, 5, and 11 months) of AD transgenic (Tg)/wild type mice. The present study was designed to characterize and provide insight into the glutathione redox state of both brain tissues and blood samples at different disease stages of this Tg model. The level of Pr-SSG increased in all AD brain tissues and blood compared with controls regardless of age. The GSH/GSSG ratio in AD-Tg brain tissue started at a higher value at 1 month, fell at the transitional period of 5 months, right before the onset of amyloid plaques, followed by an increase in GSSG and associated decrease of GSH/GSSG at 11 months. These results suggest that formation of Pr-SSG may be an early event, preceding amyloid plaque appearance, and the data further implies that tissue thiol redox is tightly regulated. Notably, the high basal levels of mixed-disulfides in hippocampus suggest a potential for increased oxidative damage under oxidizing conditions and increased GSSG in this vulnerable region.

22045494|t|c-Jun regulates the stability of anti-apoptotic DeltaNp63 in amyloid-beta-induced apoptosis.
22045494|a|p63, the structural and functional homologue of p53, is expressed either as a full-length isoform, containing a transactivation (TA) domain (TAp63), or as a truncated isoform, which lacks TA (DeltaNp63). Amyloid-beta (Abeta) incubation of neuronal cells results in stress-induced cell death through poorly understood mechanisms. We investigated the role of p63 in Abeta-induced stress. Our results show that Abeta-induced apoptosis of rat PC12 neuronal-like cells and primary cortical neurons was associated with stabilization of pro-apoptotic TAp63 and, most importantly, degradation of anti-apoptotic DeltaNp63 through a MAPK- and proteasome-dependent mechanism. This was associated with increased c-Jun, and partially modulated by tauroursodeoxycholic acid. As expected, classic genotoxic insults resulted in c-Jun upregulation and concomitant DeltaNp63 reduction. Endogenous and ectopic DeltaNp63 expression was also markedly reduced by c-Jun overexpression. Further, Abeta-mediated DeltaNp63 degradation occurred in a c-Jun-dependent manner. Downregulation of c-Jun expression by specific c-Jun siRNA abrogated the reduction of DeltaNp63 levels following Abeta insult, whereas overexpression of c-Jun led to its degradation. c-Jun significantly decreased DeltaNp63 half-life. Together, these findings demonstrate that the abundance of anti-apoptotic DeltaNp63 in response to Abeta-induced cell stress is regulated by a c-Jun-dependent mechanism, and highlight the importance of finding novel targets for potential therapeutic intervention.

22045495|t|Corticotrophin releasing factor accelerates neuropathology and cognitive decline in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
22045495|a|Chronic stress has been suggested to influence the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the mechanism underlying this influence remains unknown. In this study, we created a triple transgenic mouse model that overexpresses corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) and human amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP), to investigate whether increases in the expression of CRF can mimic the effects of stress on amyloid metabolism and the neurodegeneration. Tg2576 mice that overexpresses human AbetaPP gene were crossbreed with Tetop-CRF (CRF) mice and CaMKII-tTA (tTA) mice to create a novel triple transgenic mouse model that conditioned overexpresses CRF in forebrain and overexpresses human AbetaPP (called AbetaPP+/CRF+/tTA+, or TT mice). Then we evaluated serial neuro-anatomical and behavioral phenotypes on TT mice using histological, biochemical, and behavioral assays. TT mice showed a Cushingoid-like phenotype starting at 3 months of age. At 6 months of age, these mice demonstrated increases in tissue-soluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) and Abeta plaques in the cortex and hippocampus, as compared to control mice. Moreover, TT mice characterized substantial decreases in dendritic branching and dendritic spine density in pyramidal neurons in layer 4 of the frontal cortex and CA1 of the hippocampus. Finally, TT mice showed significantly impaired working memory and contextual memory, with a modest increase in anxiety-like behavior. Our results suggested genetic increases in the brain of CRF expression mimicked chronic stress on the effects of amyloid deposition, neurodegeneration, and behavioral deficits. The novel transgenic mouse model will provide a unique tool to further investigate the mechanisms between stress and AD.

22047631|t|Standardization of preanalytical aspects of cerebrospinal fluid biomarker testing for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis: a consensus paper from the Alzheimer's Biomarkers Standardization Initiative.
22047631|a|BACKGROUND: Numerous studies show that the cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers total tau (T-tau), tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (P-tau(181P)), and amyloid-beta (1-42) (Abeta(1-42)) have high diagnostic accuracy for Alzheimer's disease. Variability in concentrations for Abeta(1-42), T-tau, and P-tau(181P) drives the need for standardization. METHODS: Key issues were identified and discussed before the first meeting of the members of the Alzheimer's Biomarkers Standardization Initiative (ABSI). Subsequent ABSI consensus meetings focused on preanalytical issues. RESULTS: Consensus was reached on preanalytical issues such as the effects of fasting, different tube types, centrifugation, time and temperature before storage, storage temperature, repeated freeze/thaw cycles, and length of storage on concentrations of Abeta(1-42), T-tau, and P-tau(181P) in cerebrospinal fluid. CONCLUSIONS: The consensus reached on preanalytical issues and the recommendations put forward during the ABSI consensus meetings are presented in this paper.

22047632|t|Is Alzheimer's disease amyloidosis the result of a repair mechanism gone astray?
22047632|a|Here, we synthesize several lines of evidence supporting the hypothesis that at least one function of amyloid-beta is to serve as a part of the acute response to brain hemodynamic disturbances intended to seal vascular leakage. Given the resilient and adhesive physicochemical properties of amyloid, an abluminal hemostatic repair system might be highly advantageous, if deployed on a limited and short-term basis, in young individuals. However, in the aged, inevitable cardiovascular dysfunction combined with brain microvascular lesions may yield global chronic hypoperfusion that may lead to continuous amyloid deposition and consequential negative effects on neuronal viability. A large body of experimental evidence supports the hypothesis of an amyloid-beta rescue function gone astray. Preventing or inducing the removal of amyloid in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been simultaneously successful and disappointing. Amyloid deposits clearly play major roles in AD, but they may not represent the preeminent factor in dementia pathogenesis. Successful application of AD preventative approaches may hinge on an accurate and comprehensive view of comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and head trauma.

22047634|t|The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative: a review of papers published since its inception.
22047634|a|The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is an ongoing, longitudinal, multicenter study designed to develop clinical, imaging, genetic, and biochemical biomarkers for the early detection and tracking of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study aimed to enroll 400 subjects with early mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 200 subjects with early AD, and 200 normal control subjects; $67 million funding was provided by both the public and private sectors, including the National Institute on Aging, 13 pharmaceutical companies, and 2 foundations that provided support through the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health. This article reviews all papers published since the inception of the initiative and summarizes the results as of February 2011. The major accomplishments of ADNI have been as follows: (1) the development of standardized methods for clinical tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in a multicenter setting; (2) elucidation of the patterns and rates of change of imaging and CSF biomarker measurements in control subjects, MCI patients, and AD patients. CSF biomarkers are consistent with disease trajectories predicted by beta-amyloid cascade (Hardy, J Alzheimers Dis 2006;9(Suppl 3):151-3) and tau-mediated neurodegeneration hypotheses for AD, whereas brain atrophy and hypometabolism levels show predicted patterns but exhibit differing rates of change depending on region and disease severity; (3) the assessment of alternative methods of diagnostic categorization. Currently, the best classifiers combine optimum features from multiple modalities, including MRI, [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, CSF biomarkers, and clinical tests; (4) the development of methods for the early detection of AD. CSF biomarkers, beta-amyloid 42 and tau, as well as amyloid PET may reflect the earliest steps in AD pathology in mildly symptomatic or even nonsymptomatic subjects, and are leading candidates for the detection of AD in its preclinical stages; (5) the improvement of clinical trial efficiency through the identification of subjects most likely to undergo imminent future clinical decline and the use of more sensitive outcome measures to reduce sample sizes. Baseline cognitive and/or MRI measures generally predicted future decline better than other modalities, whereas MRI measures of change were shown to be the most efficient outcome measures; (6) the confirmation of the AD risk loci CLU, CR1, and PICALM and the identification of novel candidate risk loci; (7) worldwide impact through the establishment of ADNI-like programs in Europe, Asia, and Australia; (8) understanding the biology and pathobiology of normal aging, MCI, and AD through integration of ADNI biomarker data with clinical data from ADNI to stimulate research that will resolve controversies about competing hypotheses on the etiopathogenesis of AD, thereby advancing efforts to find disease-modifying drugs for AD; and (9) the establishment of infrastructure to allow sharing of all raw and processed data without embargo to interested scientific investigators throughout the world. The ADNI study was extended by a 2-year Grand Opportunities grant in 2009 and a renewal of ADNI (ADNI-2) in October 2010 through to 2016, with enrollment of an additional 550 participants.

22048123|t|In vivo P2X7 inhibition reduces amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease through GSK3beta and secretases.
22048123|a|beta-Amyloid (Abeta) peptide production from amyloid precursor protein (APP) is essential in the formation of the beta-amyloid plaques characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. However, the extracellular signals that maintain the balance between nonpathogenic and pathologic forms of APP processing, mediated by alpha-secretase and beta-secretase respectively, remain poorly understood. In the present work, we describe regulation of the processing of APP via the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) receptor P2X7R. In 2 different cellular lines, the inhibition of either native or overexpressed P2X7R increased alpha-secretase activity through inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3). In vivo inhibition of the P2X7R in J20 mice, transgenic for mutant human APP, induced a significant decrease in the number of hippocampal amyloid plaques. This reduction correlated with a decrease in glycogen synthase kinase 3 activity in J20 mice, increasing the proteolytic processing of APP through an increase in alpha-secretase activity. The in vivo findings presented here demonstrate for the first time the therapeutic potential of P2X7R antagonism in the treatment of familiar Alzheimer's disease (FAD).

22048125|t|Abeta-induced formation of autophagosomes is mediated by RAGE-CaMKKbeta-AMPK signaling.
22048125|a|Pathological autophagic vacuoles (AVs) accumulate in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, but the mechanisms by which they are induced are unknown. In this study, we found that the formation of AVs was mediated by activation of adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the brains of APP/PS1 double transgenic mice, amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) pathology-bearing model mouse. Injection of sunitinib malate, AMPK inhibitor, to the mice lowered AV formation in their brains. Consistent with our in vivo observations, treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with Abeta enhanced the induction of autophagosomes, which was mediated by Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-beta (CaMKKbeta)-AMPK signaling, as shown using various inhibitors and small interfering RNA (siRNA). CaMKKbeta is a calcium-activated kinase, and the depletion of intracellular calcium by BAPTA-AM, a Ca(2+) chelator, also curtailed Abeta-induced autophagy. Finally, the inhibition of receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) attenuated autophagsome formation and AMPK signaling. Conversely, RAGE overexpression amplified the induction of autophagy. These results implicate the regulation of the Abeta-induced formation of AVs by the RAGE-calcium-CaMKKbeta-AMPK pathway and suggest that modulation of autophagosome formation and the interaction between Abeta and RAGE are beneficial in the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease.

22050953|t|Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids (HDLS): a misdiagnosed disease entity.
22050953|a|Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids (HDLS) was originally described in a large Swedish pedigree. Since then, 22 reports describing a total of 13 kindreds and 11 sporadic cases have been published. Inheritance is autosomal dominant, albeit the gene is unknown. Here we report on the clinical findings, genealogical data, brain MRI data, and autopsy/biopsy findings of four probands from three independently ascertained novel families from Norway, Germany and US. We identified a 39-year-old female and her twin sister, a 52-year-old male and a 47-year-old male with progressive neurological illness characterized by personality changes, cognitive decline and motor impairments, such as gait problems, bradykinesia, tremor and rigidity. Brain MRI showed white matter abnormalities with frontal prominence. Brain biopsy/autopsies were consistent with HDLS. HDLS is an under-recognized disease and in reporting these cases, we aim to increase the awareness of the disorder. Due to varied and wide phenotypic presentations, which may imitate several neurodegenerative diseases, HDLS can be difficult to diagnose. Definitive diagnosis can be established only by direct brain tissue examination. Familiarity with the clinical presentation and typical neuroimaging findings may be helpful in narrowing the diagnosis.

22051943|t|The effects of MyD88 deficiency on exploratory activity, anxiety, motor coordination, and spatial learning in C57BL/6 and APPswe/PS1dE9 mice.
22051943|a|Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of pattern-recognition receptors in innate immunity and provide a first line defense against pathogens and tissue injuries. In addition to important roles in infection, inflammation, and immune diseases, recent studies show that TLR signaling is involved in modulation of learning, memory, mood, and neurogenesis. Because MyD88 is essential for the downstream signaling of all TLRs, except TLR3, we investigated the effects of MyD88 deficiency (MyD88-/-) on behavioral functions in mice. Additionally, we recently demonstrated that a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) deficient for MyD88 had decreases in Abeta deposits and soluble Abeta in the brain as compared with MyD88 sufficient AD mouse models. Because accumulation of Abeta in the brain is postulated to be a causal event leading to cognitive deficits in AD, we investigated the effects of MyD88 deficiency on behavioral functions in the AD mouse model at 10 months of age. MyD88 deficient mice showed more anxiety in the elevated plus-maze. In the motor coordination tests, MyD88 deficient mice remained on a beam and a bar for a longer time, but with slower initial movement on the bar. In the Morris water maze test, MyD88 deficiency appeared to improve spatial learning irrespective of the transgene. Our findings suggest that the MyD88-dependent pathway contributes to behavioral functions in an AD mouse model and its control group.

22052825|t|Effect of introducing a short amyloidogenic sequence from the Abeta peptide at the N-terminus of 18-residue amphipathic helical peptides.
22052825|a|Fibril formation is the hallmark of pathogenesis in Alzheimer's disease and other amyloid disorders caused by conformational alterations leading to the aggregation of soluble monomers. Abeta40 self-associates to form amyloid fibrils. Its central seven-residue segment KLVFFAE (Abeta16-22), which is thought to be crucial for fibril formation of the full-length peptide, forms fibrils even in isolation. Context-dependent induction of amyloid formation by such sequences in peptides, which otherwise do not have that propensity, is of considerable interest. We have examined the effect of introducing the Abeta16-22 sequence at the N-terminus of two amphipathic helical 18-residue peptides Ac-WYSEMKRNVQRLERAIEE-am and Ac-KQLIRFLKRLDRNLWGLA-am, which have high average hydrophobic moment <muH> values but have net charges of 0 and +4, respectively, at neutral pH. Upon incubation in aqueous buffer, fibril-like aggregates were discernible by transmission electron microscopy for the peptide with only 0 net charge, which also displayed ThT binding and beta-structure. Although both the sequences have been derived from amphipathic helical segments in globular proteins and possess high average hydrophobic moments, the +4 charge peptide lacks the ability to form fibrils, while the peptide with 0 charge has the tendency to form fibrillar structures. Variation in the net charge and the presence of several glutamic acids in the sequence of the peptide with net charge 0 appear to favor the formation of fibrils when the Abeta16-22 sequence is attached at the N-terminus.

22055653|t|Clinical and neurobiological correlates of soluble amyloid precursor proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid.
22055653|a|BACKGROUND: According to a widely accepted hypothesis, the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is processed by two competing pathways: the amyloidogenic beta-secretase-mediated pathway or the nonamyloidogenic alpha-secretase-mediated pathway. APP is cleaved preferentially through the nonamyloidogenic pathway in normal brain, whereas the balance shifts to the amyloidogenic pathway in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The levels of the alpha-secretase-cleaved soluble APP (sAPPalpha) and beta-secretase-cleaved soluble APP (sAPPbeta) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are likely to reflect these competing mechanisms. METHODS: We investigated the levels and the relationship between sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta in the CSF of 64 patients with mild AD, 76 patients with mild cognitive impairment, and 12 cognitively healthy control subjects, as well as the effect of apolipoprotein E genotype and sex on soluble APP levels. RESULTS: There was a significant positive correlation between sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta levels in all three groups. sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta concentrations were higher in patients with mild cognitive impairment compared with patients with AD. In the AD group, females exhibited higher sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta levels than males. No influence of the apolipoprotein E genotype on soluble APP concentrations was detected. DISCUSSION: The positive correlation between sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta challenges the hypothesis that AD is caused by an imbalance of the alpha- and beta-secretase APP proteolysis through competing mechanisms. Moreover, the differences in CSF levels of sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta between male and female patients with AD may reflect a "sexual dimorphism" in the activity of the two APP processing pathways in AD.

In 7-month-old TgCRND8 mice the Abeta-associated glial reaction was accompanied by an intense immunoreactivity of both TNF-alpha and inducible nitric oxide synthase, increased immunoreactivity of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax and a decrease in levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2.Cortical and hippocampal neurons of TgCRND8 mice displayed higher immunoreactivity and higher nuclear expression of the transcription factor NF-kB than controls. It is possible that such an increase could represent a defence/compensatory response to degeneration. These findings indicate that Abeta deposits activate brain-resident microglia population and astrocytes, and induce overproduction of inflammatory mediators that enhance pro- and anti-apoptotic cascades. In both 3- and 7-month-old TgCRND8 mice apparent gliogenesis was present in the vicinity of Abeta plaques in the neocortex, indicating that microglia have a high proliferative rate which might play a more complex role than previously acknowledge.

22057511|a|Dietary factors may play a role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. In an effort to recapitulate some of the synaptic protein changes observed in the disease, AD transgenic and wild-type mice were fed either a normal or pro-oxidant diet for 3 months from three months of age. Pro-oxidant diet treatment resulted in altered expression of vesicular glutamate transporter-1 and glutamine synthetase, suggesting changes in glutamatergic synaptic function, and increased expression of urokinase plasminogen activator receptor, possibly reflecting oxidative stress.

22060133|t|alpha-Synuclein oligomers oppose long-term potentiation and impair memory through a calcineurin-dependent mechanism: relevance to human synucleopathic diseases.
22060133|a|Intracellular deposition of fibrillar aggregates of alpha-synuclein (alphaSyn) characterizes neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies. However, recent evidence indicates that small alphaSyn oligomeric aggregates that precede fibril formation may be the most neurotoxic species and can be found extracellularly. This new evidence has changed the view of pathological alphaSyn aggregation from a self-contained cellular phenomenon to an extracellular event and prompted investigation of the putative effects of extracellular alphaSyn oligomers. In this study, we report that extracellular application of alphaSyn oligomers detrimentally impacts neuronal welfare and memory function. We found that oligomeric alphaSyn increased intracellular Ca(2+) levels, induced calcineurin (CaN) activity, decreased cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) transcriptional activity and resulted in calcineurin-dependent death of human neuroblastoma cells. Similarly, CaN induction and CREB inhibition were observed when alphaSyn oligomers were applied to organotypic brain slices, which opposed hippocampal long-term potentiation. Furthermore, alphaSyn oligomers induced CaN, inhibited CREB and evoked memory impairments in mice that received acute intracerebroventricular injections. Notably, all these events were reversed by pharmacological inhibition of CaN. Moreover, we found decreased active CaN and reduced levels of phosphorylated CREB in autopsy brain tissue from patients affected by dementia with Lewy bodies, which is characterized by deposition of alphaSyn aggregates and progressive cognitive decline. These results indicate that exogenously applied alphaSyn oligomers impact neuronal function and produce memory deficits through mechanisms that involve CaN activation.

22063923|t|JD-30, an active fraction extracted from Danggui-Shaoyao-San, decreases beta-amyloid content and deposition, improves LTP reduction and prevents spatial cognition impairment in SAMP8 mice.
22063923|a|JD-30 is an active fraction extracted from Danggui-Shaoyao-San (DSS), a traditional Chinese medicinal prescription. We previously showed that JD-30 could alleviate cognitive dysfunction of the mice induced by intracerebroventricular injection of beta-amyloid (Abeta). However, data remain scarce on the effect of JD-30 on an Alzheimer's disease (AD) model and the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Further detailed studies on the effects of JD-30 on spatial cognition of senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8), a suitable rodent model for cognitive impairment of aged subjects were investigated to elucidate the possible mechanisms. Long-term treatment with JD-30 significantly decreased the prolonged latency of SAMP8 in the Morris water-maze test. It also ameliorated the reduction of long-term potentiation (LTP) and reduced the damage of neurons in the hippocampus of SAMP8. Finally, JD-30 decreased the content and deposition of Abeta in the brain of SAMP8. The results show that JD-30 improves deterioration of spatial learning and memory in the SAMP8 mouse model, and by decreasing the content and deposition of Abeta, neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity improve, suggesting one of the mechanisms involved.

22064070|t|Detection of peri-synaptic amyloid-beta pyroglutamate aggregates in early stages of Alzheimer's disease and in AbetaPP transgenic mice using a novel monoclonal antibody.
22064070|a|The neurodegenerative pathology in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been associated with the progressive accumulation of aggregated and post-translationally modified amyloid-beta (Abeta) species. Among them, recent studies indicate that the pyroglutamate modification of Abeta (pE(3)Abeta) catalyzed by glutaminyl cyclase might play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD. Although the effects of the pyroglutamate modification on Abeta aggregation and toxicity have been investigated, less is known about the distribution of pE(3)Abeta across the spectrum of AD and in the brains of amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) transgenic (tg) animals. For this purpose, we generated a novel monoclonal antibody (denominated D129) that specifically recognizes pE(3)Abeta and characterized the patterns of distribution in the postmortem brain samples from AD patients divided by disease stage (Braak stage) and in AbetaPP tg mice. We found that in early stages of AD and young AbetaPP tg mice pE(3)Abeta was found in discrete linear and granular aggregates in the neuropil that co-localized with the pre-synaptic protein synaptophysin and was in close opposition to dendrites labeled with MAP2. In later stages of AD and in older AbetaPP tg mice, pE(3)Abeta was abundant in diffuse and mature plaques. In conclusion, this study suggests that peri-synaptic accumulation of pE(3)Abeta might contribute to early cognitive dysfunction in AD.

22064071|t|Endogenous secretory receptor for advanced glycation end-products inhibits amyloid-beta1-42 uptake into mouse brain.
22064071|a|The cell-surface receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) has been implicated in the development of diabetic vascular complications and Alzheimer's disease. RAGE has been considered to be involved in amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta1-42) uptake into brain. In the present study, we demonstrate that endogenous secretory RAGE (esRAGE), a decoy form of RAGE generated by alternative RNA processing, is able to inhibit Abeta1-42 influx into mouse brain. Surface plasmon resonance and competitive binding assays revealed that human Abeta1-42 interacted with human esRAGE within the immunoglobulin V type region. We next examined the uptake and distribution of 125I-labeled human Abeta1-42 in various organs and body fluids of newly created mice overexpressing human esRAGE as well as RAGE-null and wild-type (WT) mice. The transition of the 125I-labeled Abeta1-42 from circulation to brain parenchyma peaked at 30 min after the injection into WT mice, but this was significantly blunted in esRAGE-overexpressing and RAGE-null mice. Significant reduction in 125I-labeled Abeta1-42-derived photo-stimulated luminescence were marked in ventricles, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, especially CA1 and CA3 regions, putamen, and thalamus. The results thus suggest the potential of esRAGE in protection against the development of Alzheimer's disease.

22064478|t|Regulation of estrogen receptor alpha N-terminus conformation and function by peptidyl prolyl isomerase Pin1.
22064478|a|Estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), a key driver of growth in the majority of breast cancers, contains an unstructured transactivation domain (AF1) in its N terminus that is a convergence point for growth factor and hormonal activation. This domain is controlled by phosphorylation, but how phosphorylation impacts AF1 structure and function is unclear. We found that serine 118 (S118) phosphorylation of the ERalpha AF1 region in response to estrogen (agonist), tamoxifen (antagonist), and growth factors results in recruitment of the peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase Pin1. Phosphorylation of S118 is critical for Pin1 binding, and mutation of S118 to alanine prevents this association. Importantly, Pin1 isomerizes the serine118-proline119 bond from a cis to trans isomer, with a concomitant increase in AF1 transcriptional activity. Pin1 overexpression promotes ligand-independent and tamoxifen-inducible activity of ERalpha and growth of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells. Pin1 expression correlates with proliferation in ERalpha-positive rat mammary tumors. These results establish phosphorylation-coupled proline isomerization as a mechanism modulating AF1 functional activity and provide insight into the role of a conformational switch in the functional regulation of the intrinsically disordered transactivation domain of ERalpha.

22067910|t|Cognitive decline typical of frontotemporal lobar degeneration in transgenic mice expressing the 25-kDa C-terminal fragment of TDP-43.
22067910|a|Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is the pathological signature protein in several neurodegenerative disorders, including the majority of frontotemporal lobar degeneration cases (FTLD-TDP), motor neuron disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Pathological TDP-43 is mislocalized from its nuclear location to the cytoplasm, where it accumulates and is proteolytically cleaved to form C-terminal fragments. Although the 25-kDa C-terminal fragment of TDP-43 (TDP-25) accumulates in affected brain regions, its role in the disease pathogenesis remains elusive. To address this problem, we have generated a novel transgenic mouse that selectively expresses TDP-25 in neurons. We show that transgenic mice expressing TDP-25 develop cognitive deficits associated with the build-up of soluble TDP-25. These cognitive deficits are independent of TDP-43-positive inclusions and occur without overt neurodegeneration. Additionally, we show that the expression of TDP-25 is sufficient to alter the processing of endogenous full-length TDP-43. These studies represent the first in vivo demonstration of a pathological role for TDP-25 and strongly suggest that the onset of cognitive deficits in TDP-43 proteinopathies is independent of TDP-43 inclusions. These data provide a framework for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the onset of cognitive deficits in FTLD-TDP and other TDP-43 proteinopathies; thus, the TDP-25 transgenic mice represent a unique tool to reach this goal.

22070199|t|Amyloid peptide regulates calcium homoeostasis and arrhythmogenesis in pulmonary vein cardiomyocytes.
22070199|a|BACKGROUND: Amyloid peptides modulate cardiac calcium homoeostasis and play an important role in the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation. Pulmonary veins (PVs) are critical in the genesis of atrial fibrillation and contain abundant amyloid peptides. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate whether amyloid peptides may change the PV electrical activity through regulating calcium homoeostasis. METHODS AND RESULTS: The channel and calcium-handling protein expressions, intracellular calcium and ionic currents were studied in isolated rabbit PV cardiomyocytes in the presence and absence (control) of beta-amyloid (Abeta(25-35) ) for 4-6 h, using Western blot analysis, indo-1 fluorimetric ratio and whole-cell patch clamp techniques. Abeta(25-35) decreased the expressions of Ca(V) 1.2, total or Ser16-phosphorylated phospholamban (p-PLB), p-PLB/PLB ratio, sodium/calcium exchanger, but did not change ryanodine receptor, sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) ATPase and K(+) channel proteins (Kir2.1, Kir2.3, Kv1.4, Kv1.5 and Kv4.2). Abeta(25-35) -treated cardiomyocytes had smaller calcium transient, SR calcium store, L-type calcium current and sodium/calcium exchanger current than control cardiomyocytes. Moreover, Abeta(25-35) -treated cardiomyocytes (n = 20) had shorter 90% of the action potential duration (82 +- 3 vs. 93 +- 5 ms, P < 0 05) than control cardiomyocytes (n = 16). CONCLUSION: Abeta(25-35) has direct electrophysiological effects on PV cardiomyocytes.

22070531|t|Amelioration of amyloid beta-induced cognitive deficits by Zataria multiflora Boiss. essential oil in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease.
22070531|a|INTRODUCTION: The limitations of current Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapeutics have prompted investigation into innovative therapeutics focused on antiinflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective agents including those from medicinal plants. Numerous plants have been tested for their potential for alleviating symptoms of AD. AIMS: Zataria multiflora Boiss. (ZM) a member of Lamiaceae family has been used in Iranian traditional medicine for its beneficial effects on mental abilities. Therefore, the effect of its essential oil was evaluated in a rat model of AD. METHODS: Amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) fragment 25-35 was injected bilaterally in the CA1 region of rats hippocampus and the effect of different doses of ZM essential oil (50, 100, or 200 muL/kg) on cognitive function was investigated in the Morris water maze. Acute toxicity of the essential oil was also studied. RESULTS: The results showed increases in escape latency, traveled distance, heading angle, and decreases in target quadrant entries in Abeta-received groups as compared to the control group. This impairment was reversed by ZM essential oil. The results of acute toxicity testing revealed that the calculated LD50 (1264.9 muL/kg) is much higher than the therapeutic dose (100 muL/kg). CONCLUSIONS: It seems that antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and anticholinesterase activities of ZM or its main constituents might contribute to its beneficial effects in this model. Our findings suggest that ZM may be a potentially valuable source of natural therapeutic agents for the treatment of AD. However, further investigations are necessary to establish its clinical efficacy and potential toxicity, before any recommendations concerning its use as a medication in the treatment of AD.

22071505|t|Toxic effects of amyloid fibrils on cell membranes: the importance of ganglioside GM1.
22071505|a|The interaction of amyloid aggregates with the cell plasma membrane is currently considered among the basic mechanisms of neuronal dysfunction in amyloid neurodegeneration. We used amyloid oligomers and fibrils grown from the yeast prion Sup35p, responsible for the specific prion trait [PSI(+)], to investigate how membrane lipids modulate fibril interaction with the membranes of cultured H-END cells and cytotoxicity. Sup35p shares no homology with endogenous mammalian polypeptide chains. Thus, the generic toxicity of amyloids and the molecular events underlying cell degeneration can be investigated without interference with analogous polypeptides encoded by the cell genome. Sup35 fibrils bound to the cell membrane without increasing its permeability to Ca(2+). Fibril binding resulted in structural reorganization and aggregation of membrane rafts, with GM1 clustering and alteration of its mobility. Sup35 fibril binding was affected by GM1 or its sialic acid moiety, but not by cholesterol membrane content, with complete inhibition after treatment with fumonisin B1 or neuraminidase. Finally, cell impairment resulted from caspase-8 activation after Fas receptor translocation on fibril binding to the plasma membrane. Our observations suggest that amyloid fibrils induce abnormal accumulation and overstabilization of raft domains in the cell membrane and provide a reasonable, although not unique, mechanistic and molecular explanation for fibril toxicity.

22072214|t|A canine model to evaluate efficacy and safety of gamma-secretase inhibitors and modulators.
22072214|a|Gamma-secretase, a membrane bound protease which cleaves the transmembrane protein amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP), is a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease. Gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) and modulators (GSMs) are being investigated as potential disease-modifying agents. Preclinical in vivo models to monitor the activity on gamma-secretase are described in different species such as mouse, rat, and guinea pigs. All these models have their value in testing compounds with amyloid lowering properties, however, compound characteristics and pharmacokinetic properties, as well as other species characteristics such as limited sampling volumes of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), recommended the use of a larger, non-rodent animal species. For this purpose, a screening model in dogs was developed for testing GSIs and GSMs. We showed that GSIs and GSMs had a dose- and time-dependent effect on Abeta(37), Abeta(38), Abeta(40), and Abeta(42) in CSF. Changes in liver function were evidenced by a transient increase in bilirubin with the GSMs and incidental increases in alanine aminotransferase for GSMs as well as GSIs. Microarray analysis of liver biopsies enabled to elucidate potential mechanisms behind the liver function changes. The relevance of the liver findings should be further evaluated in chronic pre-clinical safety studies and in humans. Based on our data, we can conclude that the dog is a very appropriate species to assess efficacy and safety of compounds which have an effect on AbetaPP processing such as GSMs, GSIs, and BACE-inhibitors.

22076403|t|Functional consequences of the lack of amyloid precursor protein in the mouse dentate gyrus in vivo.
22076403|a|The amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we studied whether the lack of APP affects the synaptic properties in the dentate gyrus by measuring granule cell field potentials evoked by perforant path stimulation in anesthetized 9-11-month-old APP-deficient mice in vivo. We found decreased paired-pulse facilitation, indicating altered presynaptic short-term plasticity in the APP-deficient dentate gyrus. In contrast, excitatory synaptic strength and granule cell firing were unchanged in APP knockout mice. Likewise, long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by a theta-burst stimulation protocol was not impaired in the absence of APP. These findings suggest that the deletion of APP may affect presynaptic plasticity of synaptic transmission at the perforant path-granule cell synapse but leaves synaptic efficacy intact and LTP preserved, possibly due to functional redundancy within the APP gene family.

22079317|t|Genistein inhibits aggregation of exogenous amyloid-beta1-40 and alleviates astrogliosis in the hippocampus of rats.
22079317|a|We addressed the question of whether injection of Amyloid beta (Abeta)(1-40) in the rat brain is associated with pathology in the hippocampus, and if genistein has any protective effect against the neuronal damage caused by Abeta(1-40). Genistein is a plant-derived compound with a structure similar to that of the female sex hormone estrogen and it was recently shown that pretreatment with a single dose of genistein ameliorated learning and memory deficits in an (Abeta)(1-40) rat model of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we report that injection of the amyloid peptide into the hippocampus of rats led to formation of Abeta(1-40) positive aggregates close to the lateral blade of the dentate gyrus (DGlb). We also observed the following in the hippocampus: extensive cell death in the DGlb (P<0.0001), CA1 (P=0.03), and CA3 (P=0.002); an increased number of iNOS-expressing cells (P=0.01) and gliosis. Genistein given to rats by gavage 1h before injection of Abeta(1-40) inhibited the formation of Abeta(1-40) positive aggregates in the brain tissue and led to increased number of nNOS(+) (P=0.0001) cells in the hippocampus compared to sham-operated genistein-treated controls. Treatment with genistein also alleviated the extensive astrogliosis that occurred in Abeta(1-40)-injected hippocampus to a level similar to that observed in sham-operated rats. We conclude that the neurons in the DGlb are most sensitive to Abeta(1-40), and a single dose of genistein can ameliorate Abeta(1-40) induced pathology.

22080049|t|Elevated labile Cu is associated with oxidative pathology in Alzheimer disease.
22080049|a|Oxidative stress is implicated in Alzheimer disease (AD) pathogenesis, for which evidence indicates that radical species are generated by the redox-active biometal Cu. The contribution of labile Cu to the oxidative stress observed in AD has not been evaluated. The Cu content of postmortem cortical tissue from nondemented elderly controls and AD cases was measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy, and the proportion of labile Cu was assessed using the Cu-phenanthroline assay. Further, the capacity of the tissue to stabilize Cu(2+) was evaluated using immobilized metal-affinity chromatography, and the level of tissue oxidative damage was determined by the presence of thiobarbituric acid-reactive compounds. We identified elevated levels of exchangeable Cu(2+), which were correlated with tissue oxidative damage; additionally, we noted an increased capacity of AD cortical tissue samples to bind Cu(2+). This deranged Cu homeostasis reflects the homeostatic breakdown of Cu observed in AD and supports biometal metabolism as a therapeutic target.

22080177|t|Intra- and inter-cortical motor excitability in Alzheimer's disease.
22080177|a|Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) provides evidence for facilitatory and inhibitory motor dysfunctions in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The corpus callosum (CC) is affected in AD already at early stages consistent with the hypothesis that AD patients exhibit alterations in transcallosally mediated motor inhibition (ipsilateral silent period, iSP). Therefore, here we aimed at investigating the integrity not only of intra-, but also of inter-hemispheric mechanisms of cortical motor excitability in AD. We determined the iSP, the resting motor threshold (RMT), and the amplitude of motor evoked potentials (MEP) in 19 AD patients and 19 healthy controls using single-pulse TMS. Furthermore, we used paired-pulse TMS to study the intra-cortical inhibition (ICI) and intra-cortical facilitation (ICF). All subjects underwent comprehensive neuropsychologic, clinical, and laboratory testing, and neuroimaging to exclude significant co-morbidity. In AD patients, the RMT was significantly reduced (Oneway-ANOVA). An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) revealed a strong group specific interaction of the inhibitory interstimulus intervals (p = 0.005) with a reduced ICI in AD. Furthermore, we found a significantly prolonged iSP-latency (p = 0.003) in AD compared to controls, whereas the iSP-duration was not different. The iSP-latency correlated significantly with the ICI (ANCOVA) (p = 0.02). The ICF did not differ significantly between groups. Our data suggest comprehensive but still subclinical dysfunctions of motor cortical inhibition in mild to moderate clinical stages of AD with strong interactions of intra- and inter-hemispheric inhibitory phenomena. Future studies are needed to show the potential prognostic relevance of these findings for the further course of the disease.

22081976|t|Antimicrobial properties of amyloid peptides.
22081976|a|More than two dozen clinical syndromes known as amyloid diseases are characterized by the buildup of extended insoluble fibrillar deposits in tissues. These amorphous Congo red staining deposits known as amyloids exhibit a characteristic green birefringence and cross-beta structure. Substantial evidence implicates oligomeric intermediates of amyloids as toxic species in the pathogenesis of these chronic disease states. A growing body of data has suggested that these toxic species form ion channels in cellular membranes causing disruption of calcium homeostasis, membrane depolarization, energy drainage, and in some cases apoptosis. Amyloid peptide channels exhibit a number of common biological properties including the universal U-shape beta-strand-turn-beta-strand structure, irreversible and spontaneous insertion into membranes, production of large heterogeneous single-channel conductances, relatively poor ion selectivity, inhibition by Congo red, and channel blockade by zinc. Recent evidence has suggested that increased amounts of amyloids not only are toxic to its host target cells but also possess antimicrobial activity. Furthermore, at least one human antimicrobial peptide, protegrin-1, which kills microbes by a channel-forming mechanism, has been shown to possess the ability to form extended amyloid fibrils very similar to those of classic disease-forming amyloids. In this paper, we will review the reported antimicrobial properties of amyloids and the implications of these discoveries for our understanding of amyloid structure and function.

22083646|t|Interference of low-molecular substances with the thioflavin-T fluorescence assay of amyloid fibrils.
22083646|a|Abnormal fibrillization of amyloidogenic peptides/proteins has been linked to various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease as well as with type-II diabetes mellitus. The kinetics of protein fibrillization is commonly studied by using a fluorescent dye Thioflavin T (ThT) that binds to protein fibrils and exerts increased fluorescence intensity in bound state. Recently, it has been demonstrated that several low-molecular weight compounds like Basic Blue 41, Basic Blue 12, Azure C, and Tannic acid interfere with the fluorescence of ThT bound to Alzheimers' amyloid-beta fibrils and cause false positive results during the screening of fibrillization inhibitors. In the current study, we demonstrated that the same selected substances also decrease the fluorescence signal of ThT bound to insulin fibrils already at submicromolar or micromolar concentrations. Kinetic experiments show that unlike to true inhibitors, these compounds did neither decrease the fibrillization rate nor increase the lag-period. Absence of soluble insulin in the end of the experiment confirmed that these compounds do not disaggregate the insulin fibrils and, thus, are not fibrillization inhibitors at concentrations studied. Our results show that interference with ThT test is a general phenomenon and more attention has to be paid to interpretation of kinetic results of protein fibrillization obtained by using fluorescent dyes.

22085646|t|Structural features of the KPI domain control APP dimerization, trafficking, and processing.
22085646|a|The two major isoforms of human APP, APP695 and APP751, differ by the presence of a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor (KPI) domain in the extracellular region. APP processing and function is thought to be regulated by homodimerization. We used bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) to study dimerization of different APP isoforms and mutants. APP751 was found to form significantly more homodimers than APP695. Mutation of dimerization motifs in the TM domain did not affect fluorescence complementation, but native folding of KPI is critical for APP751 homodimerization. APP751 and APP695 dimers were mostly localized at steady state in the Golgi region, suggesting that most of the APP751 and 695 dimers are in the secretory pathway. Mutation of the KPI led to the retention of the APP homodimers in the endoplasmic reticulum. We finally showed that APP751 is more efficiently processed through the nonamyloidogenic pathway than APP695. These findings provide new insight on the particular role of KPI domain in APP dimerization. The correlation observed between dimerization, subcellular localization, and processing suggests that dimerization acts as an efficient regulator of APP trafficking in the secretory compartments that has major consequences on its processing.

22085694|t|Impaired long-trace eyeblink conditioning in a Tg2576 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
22085694|a|Eyeblink conditioning has been used for assessing cognitive performance in cases of human neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we tested and compared the delay and long-trace interval (TI=500ms) eyeblink conditionings in a Tg2576 mouse model of AD, at the age of 3, 6, and 12 months. Tg2576 mice exhibited significant impairment in trace conditioning at 6 months of age. In contrast, delay conditioning was not impaired in Tg2576 mice even at 12 months. These findings indicate that the long-TI eyeblink conditioning is more susceptible to age-related cognitive deterioration than delay conditioning in Tg2576 mice. The long-trace eyeblink conditioning could be a potential tool for detecting early cognitive deficits in AD mouse model.

22085862|t|Formononetin protects neurons against hypoxia-induced cytotoxicity through upregulation of ADAM10 and sAbetaPPalpha.
22085862|a|Formononetin, an active constituent of the Chinese herb Astragali Radix, has been reported to have beneficial effects for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet the mechanism of this effect remains to be elucidated. The present study shows that formononetin increases soluble-AbetaPPalpha (sAbetaPPalpha) secretion and thus protects human-AbetaPP Swedish mutation cell (N2a-AbetaPP cell) from hypoxia-induced apoptosis. Using hypoxic N2a-AbetaPP cell as an in vitro model of AD-like pathology, we confirmed that regular treatment with formononetin could have neuroprotective effects, followed respectively by reduced caspase 3 activity and increased cell viability. Strikingly, our data revealed that the caspase 3-blocking effect of formononetin was largely mediated by stimulation of alpha-secretase cleavage of AbetaPP, and increasing the secretion of its soluble form, sAbetaPPalpha. Moreover, the protective effect of formononetin was totally inhibited by TAPI-2, an alpha-secretase complex inhibitor, suggesting the role of the sAbetaPPalpha pathway in the neuroprotective response to formononetin. We also found that the stimulative effect of formononetin on alpha-secretase activity was mainly conducted by upregulating ADAM10 expression at the transcriptional level. Altogether, our study provides novel insights into how formononetin mediates stimulation of the ADAM10-sAbetaPPalpha pathway and exerts a neuronal protective effect.

22086493|t|Roles of amyloid precursor protein family members in neuroprotection, stress signaling and aging.
22086493|a|The roles of amyloid precursor protein (APP) family members in normal brain function are poorly understood. Under physiological conditions the majority of APP appears to be processed along the non-amyloidogenic pathway leading to the formation of the secreted N-terminal APP fragment sAPPalpha. This cleavage product of APP has been implicated in several physiological processes such as neuroprotection, synaptic plasticity, neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis. In this review we focus on the role of APP family members in neuroprotection and summarize the cellular and molecular mechanisms which are believed to mediate this effect. We propose that a reduction of APP processing along the non-amyloidogenic pathway during brain aging could result in an enhanced susceptibility of neurons to cellular stress and could contribute to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease.

22086824|t|Cell-line specific protection by berry polyphenols against hydrogen peroxide challenge and lack of effect on metabolism of amyloid precursor protein.
22086824|a|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) altered metabolism, Abeta-overproduction/aggregation and oxidative stress are implicated in the development of Alzheimer's disease pathology. Based on our previous data indicating that administration of a polyphenol-rich (PrB) blueberry extract (from wild Vaccinium angustifolium) is memory enhancing in healthy mice and in order to delineate the neuroprotective mechanisms, this study investigated the antioxidant effects of PrB in H2O2-induced oxidative damage, Abeta peptide fibrillogenesis and APP metabolism. PrB suppressed H2O2-initiated oxidation (DCF assay) and cell death (MTT assay) in SH-SY5Y cells. Protective effects were observed on Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells overexpressing APP770 carrying the mutation Val717Phe only at high concentrations, while further damage on HEK293 cells was induced after co-treatment with 250 microM H2O2 and PrB in comparison with H2O2 alone. Using the thioflavine T assay, blueberry polyphenols inhibited Abeta-aggregation (~70%, 15 microg/mL) in a time-dependent manner, while in the CHO(APP770) cells it had no effect on APP metabolism as assessed by western blot. The results suggest that blueberry polyphenols exhibit antioxidant and/or pro-oxidant properties according to the cellular environment and have no effect on APP metabolism.

22086926|t|Down-regulation of the ATP-binding cassette transporter 2 (Abca2) reduces amyloid-beta production by altering Nicastrin maturation and intracellular localization.
22086926|a|Clinical, pharmacological, biochemical, and genetic evidence support the notion that alteration of cholesterol homeostasis strongly predisposes to Alzheimer disease (AD). The ATP-binding cassette transporter-2 (Abca2), which plays a role in intracellular sterol trafficking, has been genetically linked to AD. It is unclear how these two processes are related. Here we demonstrate that down-regulation of Abca2 in mammalian cells leads to decreased amyloid-beta (Abeta) generation. In vitro studies revealed altered gamma-secretase complex formation in Abca2 knock-out cells due to the altered levels, post-translational modification, and subcellular localization of Nicastrin. Reduced Abca2 levels in mammalian cells in vitro, in Drosophila melanogaster and in mice resulted in altered gamma-secretase processing of APP, and thus Abeta generation, without affecting Notch cleavage.

22089933|t|Interactions of amyloid beta peptide 1-40 and cerebrosterol.
22089933|a|Amyloid beta peptides appear to play a role in physiological processes; however, they are also involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. Their actions under normal conditions are probably mediated by soluble monomeric L-isoforms at low concentrations, perhaps via highly specific interactions. On the contrary, toxic effects of aggregated natural L-isoforms/synthetic D-isoforms on membranes are very similar, but synthetic reverse/random L: -isoforms without pronounced aggregation properties are not toxic. Our previous work reported interactions of non-aggregated/aggregated L-isoforms of amyloid beta peptides 1-40/1-42 with racemic 24-hydroxycholesterol. In this study, stereospecificity in the interactions of natural 24(S)hydroxycholesterol (cerebrosterol) or synthetic 24(R)hydroxycholesterol with soluble fragment 1-40 was evaluated by means of an in vitro test based on increased vulnerability of the hemicholinium-3 sensitive high-affinity choline uptake system in rat hippocampal cholesterol-depleted synaptosomes to the actions of amyloid beta; computational simulations were also performed. Our results suggest that: (1) 24(S)hydroxycholesterol interacts with L-peptide 1-40 but not with the reverse L-peptide 40-1, (2) 24(R)hydroxycholesterol does not interact with L-peptide 1-40 or reverse 40-1, and (3) both enantiomers can probably interact with D-peptide 1-40. Therefore, the binding of 24(S)hydroxycholesterol is not fully stereospecific and the interaction could not reflect a physiological mechanism. Data from the computational simulation indicate that the hydrophobic core of the amyloid beta molecule interacts with the hydrophobic part of 24(S)hydroxycholesterol, but no hydrogen bonds with high stability were found. Using this procedure, globular amyloid beta could retain 24(S)hydroxycholesterol and thus contribute to its pathological accumulation in the brains of patients with Alzheimer disease.

22091989|t|Binding of inositol stereoisomers to model amyloidogenic peptides.
22091989|a|The self-aggregation of proteins into amyloid fibrils is a pathological hallmark of numerous incurable diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. scyllo-Inositol is a stereochemistry-dependent in vitro inhibitor of amyloid formation. As the first step to elucidate its mechanism of action, we present molecular dynamics simulations of scyllo-inositol and its inactive stereoisomer, chiro-inositol, with simple peptide models, alanine dipeptide (ADP) and (Gly-Ala)(4). We characterize molecular interactions and compute equilibrium binding constants between inositol and ADP as well as, successively, monomers, amorphous aggregates, and fibril-like beta-sheet aggregates of (Gly-Ala)(4). Inositol interacts weakly with all peptide systems considered, with millimolar to molar affinities, and displaces the conformational equilibria of ADP but not of the (Gly-Ala)(4) systems. However, scyllo- and chiro-inositol adopt different binding modes on the surface of beta-sheet aggregates. These results suggest that inositol does not inhibit amyloid formation by breaking up preformed aggregates but rather by binding to the surface of prefibrillar aggregates.

22094714|t|Role of APP for dendritic spine formation and stability.
22094714|a|The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is transported in high amounts to the presynaptic endings where its function is still unknown. Several studies indicate that lack of APP or its overexpression affects the number of dendritic spines, the postsynaptic compartment of excitatory synapses. Since synapse loss has been identified as one of the most important structural correlates of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's diseases (AD), the physiological function of APP at synapses, specifically at dendritic spines, has come into focus in AD research. This review intends to give an overview of the very controversial results on APP expression on dendritic spine number in the mouse brain.

22098589|t|Ethionamide boosters. 2. Combining bioisosteric replacement and structure-based drug design to solve pharmacokinetic issues in a series of potent 1,2,4-oxadiazole EthR inhibitors.
22098589|a|Mycobacterial transcriptional repressor EthR controls the expression of EthA, the bacterial monooxygenase activating ethionamide, and is thus largely responsible for the low sensitivity of the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis to this antibiotic. We recently reported structure-activity relationships of a series of 1,2,4-oxadiazole EthR inhibitors leading to the discovery of potent ethionamide boosters. Despite high metabolic stability, pharmacokinetic evaluation revealed poor mice exposure; therefore, a second phase of optimization was required. Herein a structure-property relationship study is reported according to the replacement of the two aromatic heterocycles: 2-thienyl and 1,2,4-oxadiazolyl moieties. This work was done using a combination of structure-based drug design and in vitro/ex vivo evaluations of ethionamide boosters on the targeted protein EthR and on the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Thanks to this process, we identified compound 42 (BDM41906), which displays improved efficacy in addition to high exposure to mice after oral administration.

22101005|t|The effect of amyloid associated proteins on the expression of genes involved in amyloid-beta clearance by adult human astrocytes.
22101005|a|Astrocytes appear to be important mediators in the clearance of amyloid beta1-42 (Abeta), the key component of senile plaques characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, we found the amyloid associated proteins (AAPs) alpha1-antichymotrypsin (ACT), apolipoprotein J and E (ApoJ and ApoE) and a mixture of serum amyloid P (SAP) and C1q (SAP-C1q) to modify Abeta-uptake by human astrocytes. Here we investigated the effect of oligomeric (Abetaoligo) and fibrillar Abeta (Abetafib), alone and in combination with a panel of AAPs on the astrocytic expression of genes proposed to be involved in Abeta-uptake and degradation. Primary human astrocytes (isolated from non-demented control (n=4) and AD patient (n=4) brain specimens) were exposed to either Abetaoligo or Abetafib preparations with or without the above mentioned AAPs. Quantitative gene expression analysis of Abeta-receptors Scavenger receptor B1 (SCARB1), macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO) and low density lipoprotein receptor related protein-2 (LRP2 or megalin) as well as of Abeta-degrading enzymes neprilysin (NEP), insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) and metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) was performed by real-time PCR. Basal expression of NEP, IDE and SCARB1 was easily detected whereas expression of MARCO, LRP2 and MMP-9 could only be detected upon pre-amplification. Basal expression of NEP, IDE and SCARB1 did not change upon exposure to Abetaoligo or Abetafib alone in any of the investigated astrocyte cultures. Interestingly NEP expression was increased upon exposure to ApoE in combination with both Abeta-preparations, and also SCARB1 expression was induced upon treatment with ApoE in combination with Abetafib in astrocytes from non-demented controls. Further, SAP-C1q increased SCARB1 expression in control astrocytes when combined with Abetaoligo. These alterations were not found in astrocytes from AD patients. Thus, we conclude that Abeta alone apparently does not affect the astrocytic expression of IDE, NEP or SCARB1. However, NEP and SCARB1 expression is increased in astrocytes from non-demented subjects when exposed to Abeta combined with AAPs like ApoE. These astrocytic gene expression-regulatory mechanisms appear to be defective in AD and thus might contribute to the development and progression of AD pathology.

22101365|t|National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association guidelines for the neuropathologic assessment of Alzheimer's disease: a practical approach.
22101365|a|We present a practical guide for the implementation of recently revised National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association guidelines for the neuropathologic assessment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Major revisions from previous consensus criteria are: (1) recognition that AD neuropathologic changes may occur in the apparent absence of cognitive impairment, (2) an "ABC" score for AD neuropathologic change that incorporates histopathologic assessments of amyloid beta deposits (A), staging of neurofibrillary tangles (B), and scoring of neuritic plaques (C), and (3) more detailed approaches for assessing commonly co-morbid conditions such as Lewy body disease, vascular brain injury, hippocampal sclerosis, and TAR DNA binding protein (TDP)-43 immunoreactive inclusions. Recommendations also are made for the minimum sampling of brain, preferred staining methods with acceptable alternatives, reporting of results, and clinico-pathologic correlations.

22101739|t|Regulation of IL-1beta-induced cyclooxygenase-2 expression by interactions of Abeta peptide, apolipoprotein E and nitric oxide in human neuroglioma.
22101739|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by chronic neuroinflammation, which may lead to dysfunction in neuronal circuits. Although reactive microglia are found in association with accumulation of beta amyloid (Abeta) plaques in the AD brain, their contribution to neuronal cell loss remains speculative. A major genetic risk factor for sporadic AD is inheritance of the apolipoprotein (apo) E4 allele, which has been shown to contribute significantly to neurodegeneration in AD. Many studies have documented the ability of Abeta fibrils in vitro to induce microglia to undergo phenotypic activation, which results in the secretion and/or expression of a plethora of free radicals and pro-inflammatory mediators. These mediators, such as reactive nitrogen/oxygen species and IL-1beta as well as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) with associated prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)), are believed to be neurotoxic and to contribute to the underlying cause of AD. We have used the human H4 neuroglioma cells as a model astroglial system to examine the interactions between IL-1beta and nitric oxide (NO) as co-stimulators of Abeta(1-40) in enhancing the expression of COX-2 and production of PGE(2) in the presence of recombinant human apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4). Neither Abeta(1-40) nor its reverse sequence analog Abeta(40-1) alone had a significant effect on COX-2 expression and PGE(2) production in the cells. In contrast, after co-incubation with apoE4, Abeta(1-40) increased IL-1beta-induced COX-2 expression and PGE(2) production. Abeta(12-28), which binds with high affinity to apoE4, blocked apoE4-mediated effects on Abeta(1-40). Furthermore, (+-)-S-Nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), an agent that releases nitric oxide (NO) in situ, alone did not affect IL-1beta-induced COX-2 expression, but increased PGE(2) production only. Addition of Abeta(1-40) preincubated with apoE4 to H4 cells in the presence of SNAP led to an additive IL-1beta-induced COX-2 expression and PGE(2) production. These observations indicate that increased PGE(2) resulted from increased nitrosative stress, which is enhanced by apoE4. Thus a molecular understanding of the interactions of apoE4 with Abeta, NO and IL-1beta on the regulation of the COX-2/prostaglandin pathway may open new avenues in understanding the mechanism of development of neurodegenerative disease such as AD.

22102154|t|Cryptotanshinione inhibits beta-amyloid aggregation and protects damage from beta-amyloid in SH-SY5Y cells.
22102154|a|The deposition of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) fibrils into plaques within the brain parenchyma and along cerebral blood vessels is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta42 oligomers and fibrils cause the breakdown of neural circuits, neuronal death and eventually dementia. Drugs that inhibit Abeta42 aggregation may be a novel direction in AD drug discovery. Cryptotanshinone (CTS), an active component of the medicinal herb Salvia miltiorrhiza, has been shown to improve learning and memory in several pharmacological models of AD. However, the effects of CTS on the Abeta aggregation and toxicity are unclear. The current work shows the effectiveness of CTS on the inhibition of Abeta42 aggregation and toxicity to human neuroblastoma cells. In this study, we demonstrated that CTS can inhibit Abeta42 spontaneous aggregation using thioflavin T fluorescence assay and transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of CTS on Abeta-induced oxidative cell death in cultured SH-SY5Y cells. MTT and lactate dehydrogenase assays showed that CTS reduced the cytotoxicity induced by Abeta42. CTS also dramatically reduced Abeta42-induced cellular apoptosis and increased level of reactive oxygen species in these cells. Our study suggests that CTS may be useful in the inhibition or prevention of AD development and progression.

22102410|t|Binding with nucleic acids or glycosaminoglycans converts soluble protein oligomers to amyloid.
22102410|a|Ample evidence suggests that almost all polypeptides can either adopt a native structure (folded or intrinsically disordered) or form misfolded amyloid fibrils. Soluble protein oligomers exist as an intermediate between these two states, and their cytotoxicity has been implicated in the pathology of multiple human diseases. However, the mechanism by which soluble protein oligomers develop into insoluble amyloid fibrils is not clear, and investigation of this important issue is hindered by the unavailability of stable protein oligomers. Here, we have obtained stabilized protein oligomers generated from common native proteins. These oligomers exert strong cytotoxicity and display a common conformational structure shared with known protein oligomers. They are soluble and remain stable in solution. Intriguingly, the stabilized protein oligomers interact preferentially with both nucleic acids and glycosaminoglycans (GAG), which facilitates their rapid conversion into insoluble amyloid. Concomitantly, binding with nucleic acids or GAG strongly diminished the cytotoxicity of the protein oligomers. EGCG, a small molecule that was previously shown to directly bind to protein oligomers, effectively inhibits the conversion to amyloid. These results indicate that stabilized oligomers of common proteins display characteristics similar to those of disease-associated protein oligomers and represent immediate precursors of less toxic amyloid fibrils. Amyloid conversion is potently expedited by certain physiological factors, such as nucleic acids and GAGs. These findings concur with reports of cofactor involvement with disease-associated amyloid and shed light on potential means to interfere with the pathogenic properties of misfolded proteins.

22103431|t|Dissociation of ERK signalling inhibition from the anti-amyloidogenic action of synthetic ceramide analogues.
22103431|a|Inhibition of GSL (glycosphingolipid) synthesis reduces Abeta (amyloid beta-peptide) production in vitro. Previous studies indicate that GCS (glucosylceramide synthase) inhibitors modulate phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2) and that the ERK pathway may regulate some aspects of Abeta production. It is not clear whether there is a causative relationship linking GSL synthesis inhibition, ERK phosphorylation and Abeta production. In the present study, we treated CHO cells (Chinese-hamster ovary cells) and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, that both constitutively express human wild-type APP (amyloid precursor protein) and process this to produce Abeta, with GSL-modulating agents to explore this relationship. We found that three related ceramide analogue GSL inhibitors, based on the PDMP (D-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol) structure, reduced cellular Abeta production and in all cases this was correlated with inhibition of pERK (phosphorylated ERK) formation. Importantly, the L-threo enantiomers of these compounds (that are inferior GSL synthesis inhibitors compared with the D-threo-enantiomers) also reduced ERK phosphorylation to a similar extent without altering Abeta production. Inhibition of ERK activation using either PD98059 [2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one] or U0126 (1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis[2-aminophenylthio] butadiene) had no impact on Abeta production, and knockdown of endogenous GCS using small interfering RNA reduced cellular GSL levels without suppressing Abeta production or pERK formation. Our data suggest that the alteration in pERK levels following treatment with these ceramide analogues is not the principal mechanism involved in the inhibition of Abeta generation and that the ERK signalling pathway does not play a crucial role in processing APP through the amyloidogenic pathway.

22108168|t|Cholesterol promotes the interaction of Alzheimer beta-amyloid monomer with lipid bilayer.
22108168|a|Cholesterol in the plasma membrane plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, but the exact function of cholesterol in the regulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) generation, aggregation, and toxicity remains elusive. To gain insight into the bioactivity of cholesterol, we investigate the effect of cholesterol levels on the interaction of Abeta(1-42) monomer with the zwitterionic 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) bilayer containing different mole fractions of cholesterol from chi=0, 0.2, to 0.4 using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Simulation results show that an increased cholesterol level alters the structure, dynamics, and surface chemistry of the lipid bilayer, leading to increased bilayer thickness, hydrophobic chain order, surface hydrophobicity, and decreased lipid mobility. All these effects significantly promote the binding of Abeta to the lipid bilayer. Mechanistically, the adsorption of Abeta on the bilayer is a cooperative process. First, charged residues act as anchors to establish the initial binding of Abeta to phosphate headgroups of the bilayer driven by electrostatic interactions, which further facilitates hydrophobic residues to reside on the bilayer. Once hydrophobic residues especially from C-terminus are locked on the bilayer, the interactions among charged residues, lipid bilayer, and calcium ions are optimized to provide additional attractive forces to stabilize Abeta adsorbed on or inserted into the lipid bilayer. Inclusion of cholesterol makes this binding process more energetically favorable. Upon adsorption on the bilayer, Abeta appears to preferentially adopt alpha-helical or unstructured conformation. This work supports that cholesterol acts as a promoter for Abeta--membrane interactions, which would facilitate Abeta aggregation and membrane insertion.

22108346|t|Identification and characterization of diarylimidazoles as hybrid inhibitors of butyrylcholinesterase and amyloid beta fibril formation.
22108346|a|In this contribution, a chemical collection of aromatic compounds was screened for inhibition on butyrylcholinesterase (BChE)'s hydrolase activity using Ellman's reaction. A set of diarylimidazoles was identified as highly selective inhibitors of BChE hydrolase activity and amyloid beta (Abeta) fibril formation. New derivatives were synthesized resulting in several additional hits, from which the most active was 6c, 4-(3-ethylthiophenyl)-2-(3-thienyl)-1H-imidazole, an uncompetitive inhibitor of BChE hydrolase activity (IC50 BChE=0.10 muM; K(i)=0.073 +- 0.011 muM) acting also on Abeta fibril formation (IC50=5.8 muM). With the aid of structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies, chemical motifs influencing the BChE inhibitory activity of these imidazoles were proposed. These bifunctional inhibitors represent good tools in basic studies of BChE and/or promising lead molecules for AD therapy.

22112547|t|AbetaPP accumulation and/or intraneuronal amyloid-beta accumulation? The 3xTg-AD mouse model revisited.
22112547|a|The triple-transgenic Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model, 3xTg-AD, played an important role in supporting the intraneuronal amyloid-beta (Abeta) hypothesis in AD. However, recent evidence claims that the 3xTg-AD mice accumulate amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) instead of Abeta within neurons. In the present report, we re-investigated the 3xTg-AD mouse model and confirmed recent findings of age-dependent AbetaPP accumulations. In addition, intraneuronal Abeta was detected mainly in the neocortex using conformation-specific as well as antibodies directed against Abeta neo-epitopes. In contrast to previous work, however, only minor levels of intraneuronal Abeta were detected in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in aged 3xTg-AD mice.

22115042|t|MOCA is an integrator of the neuronal death signals that are activated by familial Alzheimer's disease-related mutants of amyloid beta precursor protein and presenilins.
22115042|a|The death of cholinergic neurons in the cerebral cortex and certain subcortical regions is linked to irreversible dementia relevant to AD (Alzheimer's disease). Although multiple studies have shown that expression of a FAD (familial AD)-linked APP (amyloid beta precursor protein) or a PS (presenilin) mutant, but not that of wild-type APP or PS, induced neuronal death by activating intracellular death signals, it remains to be addressed how these signals are interrelated and what the key molecule involved in this process is. In the present study, we show that the PS1-mediated (or possibly the PS2-mediated) signal is essential for the APP-mediated death in a gamma-secretase-independent manner and vice versa. MOCA (modifier of cell adhesion), which was originally identified as being a PS- and Rac1-binding protein, is a common downstream constituent of these neuronal death signals. Detailed molecular analysis indicates that MOCA is a key molecule of the AD-relevant neuronal death signals that links the PS-mediated death signal with the APP-mediated death signal at a point between Rac1 [or Cdc42 (cell division cycle 42)] and ASK1 (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1).

22116192|t|Tau elevations in the brain extracellular space correlate with reduced amyloid-beta levels and predict adverse clinical outcomes after severe traumatic brain injury.
22116192|a|Axonal injury is believed to be a major determinant of adverse outcomes following traumatic brain injury. However, it has been difficult to assess acutely the severity of axonal injury in human traumatic brain injury patients. We hypothesized that microdialysis-based measurements of the brain extracellular fluid levels of tau and neurofilament light chain, two low molecular weight axonal proteins, could be helpful in this regard. To test this hypothesis, 100 kDa cut-off microdialysis catheters were placed in 16 patients with severe traumatic brain injury at two neurological/neurosurgical intensive care units. Tau levels in the microdialysis samples were highest early and fell over time in all patients. Initial tau levels were >3-fold higher in patients with microdialysis catheters placed in pericontusional regions than in patients in whom catheters were placed in normal-appearing right frontal lobe tissue (P = 0.005). Tau levels and neurofilament light-chain levels were positively correlated (r = 0.6, P = 0.013). Neurofilament light-chain levels were also higher in patients with pericontusional catheters (P = 0.04). Interestingly, initial tau levels were inversely correlated with initial amyloid-beta levels measured in the same samples (r = -0.87, P = 0.000023). This could be due to reduced synaptic activity in areas with substantial axonal injury, as amyloid-beta release is closely coupled with synaptic activity. Importantly, high initial tau levels correlated with worse clinical outcomes, as assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale 6 months after injury (r = -0.6, P = 0.018). Taken together, our data add support for the hypothesis that axonal injury may be related to long-term impairments following traumatic brain injury. Microdialysis-based measurement of tau levels in the brain extracellular space may be a useful way to assess the severity of axonal injury acutely in the intensive care unit. Further studies with larger numbers of patients will be required to assess the reproducibility of these findings and to determine whether this approach provides added value when combined with clinical and radiological information.

22116809|t|Amyloid-beta contributes to blood-brain barrier leakage in transgenic human amyloid precursor protein mice and in humans with cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
22116809|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a degenerative disorder characterized by amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition in the blood-brain barrier (BBB). CAA contributes to injuries of the neurovasculature including lobar hemorrhages, cortical microbleeds, ischemia, and superficial hemosiderosis. We postulate that CAA pathology is partially due to Abeta compromising the BBB. METHODS: We characterized 19 patients with acute stroke with "probable CAA" for neurovascular pathology based on MRI and clinical findings. Also, we studied the effect of Abeta on the expression of tight junction proteins and matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) in isolated rat brain microvessels. RESULTS: Two of 19 patients with CAA had asymptomatic BBB leakage and posterior reversible encephalopathic syndrome indicating increased BBB permeability. In addition to white matter changes, diffusion abnormality suggesting lacunar ischemia was found in 4 of 19 patients with CAA; superficial hemosiderosis was observed in 7 of 9 patients. Abeta(40) decreased expression of the tight junction proteins claudin-1 and claudin-5 and increased expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Analysis of brain microvessels from transgenic mice overexpressing human amyloid precursor protein revealed the same expression pattern for tight junction and MMP proteins. Consistent with reduced tight junction and increased MMP expression and activity, permeability was increased in brain microvessels from human amyloid precursor protein mice compared with microvessels from wild-type controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that Abeta contributes to changes in brain microvessel tight junction and MMP expression, which compromises BBB integrity. We conclude that Abeta causes BBB leakage and that assessing BBB permeability could potentially help characterize CAA progression and be a surrogate marker for treatment response.

22118948|t|The Arctic amyloid-beta precursor protein (AbetaPP) mutation results in distinct plaques and accumulation of N- and C-truncated Abeta.
22118948|a|The Arctic (p. E693G) mutation in the amyloid-beta precursor protein (AbetaPP) facilitates amyloid-beta (Abeta) protofibril formation and generates clinical symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, molecular details of Abeta in post mortem brain were investigated with biochemical and morphological techniques. The basic structure of Arctic plaques resembled cotton wool plaques. However, they appeared ring-formed with Abeta42-specific antibodies, but were actually targetoid, since the periphery and center of many parenchymal Abeta deposits stained differently with mid-domain, N- and C-terminal Abeta antibodies. Abeta fibrils were similar in shape, albeit shorter than in sporadic AD brain, when examined by electron microscopy. Abetawild-type and Abetaarctic codeposited and parenchymal deposits were highly enriched in both N- and C-terminally truncated Abeta. In contrast, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) contained a substantial amount of Abeta1-40. The absence of plaques with cores of fibrillary Abeta might be due to the scarcity of full-length Abeta, although other mechanisms could be involved. Our findings are discussed in relation to mechanisms and relevance of amyloid formation and to the clinical features of AD.

22119000|t|Estrogen protects against amyloid-beta toxicity by estrogen receptor alpha-mediated inhibition of Daxx translocation.
22119000|a|Estrogen was shown to promote neuronal survival against several neurotoxic insults including beta-amyloid (Abeta). The proposed mechanism includes the activation of the mitogen activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Mapk/Erk), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathways and the upregulation of antiapoptotic proteins. On the other hand, Abeta neurotoxicity depends on the activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (Ask1), and both Ask1 activity and Abeta toxicity are inhibited by thioredoxin-1 (Trx1). Here, we explored the possibility that estrogen could protect cells against Abeta(1-42) toxicity by inhibiting the Ask1 cascade or by modulating Trx1. Cytosolic translocation of death-associated protein Daxx was used as indicator of Ask1 activity. Using human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, 17beta-estradiol (E2) and specific agonists for estrogen receptor (ER) alpha or beta we demonstrated that nM concentrations of E2 protected against Abeta(1-42) by a mechanism depending upon ERalpha stimulation, Akt activation and Ask1 inhibition. Moreover, this protection would occur independently of ERbeta and the induction of Trx1 expression. Our results emphasize the importance of Ask1 cascade in Abeta toxicity, and of ERalpha and Ask1 as targets for developing new neuroprotective drugs.

22119192|t|MiR-106b impairs cholesterol efflux and increases Abeta levels by repressing ABCA1 expression.
22119192|a|ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) is a cholesterol transporter that transfers excess cellular cholesterol onto lipid-poor apolipoproteins. Given its critical role in cholesterol homeostasis, ABCA1 has been studied as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease. Transcriptional regulation of ABCA1 by liver X receptor has been well characterized. However, whether ABCA1 expression is regulated at the posttranscriptional level is largely unknown. Identification of a novel pathway that regulates ABCA1 expression may provide new strategy for regulating cholesterol metabolism and amyloid beta (Abeta) levels. Since ABCA1 has an unusually long 3' untranslated region, we investigated whether microRNAs could regulate ABCA1 expression. We identified miR-106b as a novel regulator of ABCA1 expression and Abeta metabolism. miR-106b significantly decreased ABCA1 levels and impaired cellular cholesterol efflux in neuronal cells. Furthermore, miR-106b dramatically increased levels of secreted Abeta by increasing Abeta production and preventing Abeta clearance. Alterations in Abeta production and clearance were rescued by expression of miR-106b-resistant ABCA1. Taken together, our data suggest that miR-106b affects Abeta metabolism by suppressing ABCA1 expression.

22119426|t|MicroRNA networks surrounding APP and amyloid-beta metabolism--implications for Alzheimer's disease.
22119426|a|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA regulators of protein synthesis that function as "fine-tuning" tools of gene expression in development and tissue homeostasis. Their profiles are significantly altered in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) that is characterized by both amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau deposition in brain. A key challenge remains in determining how changes in miRNA profiles translate into biological function in a physiological and pathological context. The key lies in identifying specific target genes for deregulated miRNAs and understanding which pathogenic factors trigger their deregulation. Here we review the literature about the intricate network of miRNAs surrounding the regulation of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) from which Abeta is derived by proteolytic cleavage. Normal brain function is highly sensitive to any changes in APP metabolism and miRNAs function at several steps to ensure that the correct APP end product is produced and in the right form and abundance. Disruptions in this miRNA regulatory network may therefore alter Abeta production, which in turn can affect miRNA expression.

22120156|t|Physiological functions of the amyloid precursor protein secretases ADAM10, BACE1, and presenilin.
22120156|a|Alzheimer's disease causing mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) or in the Presenilin 1 (PS1) or Presenilin 2 (PS2) genes increase the production of amyloid peptides (Abeta) that precipitate in amyloid plaques. Since amyloid plaques are also a prominent feature of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), abnormal proteolysis of APP and the generation of amyloid beta (Abeta) are key events in the pathogenesis of AD. The proteases (secretases) that cleave APP are therefore important therapeutic targets, both for the rare familial forms but likely also for the sporadic forms of AD. The identification and understanding of the (neuro)biological functions of the alpha-, beta-, and presenilin/gamma-secretase (complexes) is important for the development of drugs and the delineation of their associated side effects. The potential impact of this type of research exceeds the AD field since the function of these secretases are also linked to cellular pathways like ectodomain shedding of growth factors and regulated intramembrane proteolysis of receptors in developmental biology, tissue homeostasis, and tumorigenesis. The generation of mice deficient in presenilin 1, presenilin 2, the alpha-secretase ADAM10, and the beta-secretases BACE1 and BACE2 were instrumental for the elucidation of the physiological functions of these proteases. Using these mouse models understanding how these secretases regulate amyloid peptide formation and how they exert their diverse biological functions could be significantly increased. This review attempts to summarize selected aspects of the current view of the multiple roles such proteases play in health and disease.

22121879|t|Identification and biology of alpha-secretase.
22121879|a|'Secretase' is a generic term coined more than 20 years ago to refer to a group of proteases responsible for the cleavage of a vast number of membrane proteins. These endoproteolytic events result in the extracellular or intracellular release of soluble metabolites associated with a broad range of intrinsic physiological functions. alpha-Secretase refers to the activity targeting the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and generating sAPPalpha, a soluble extracellular fragment potentially associated with neurotrophic and neuroprotective functions. Several proteases from the a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) family, including ADAM10 and ADAM17, have been directly or indirectly associated with the constitutive and regulated alpha-secretase activities. Recent evidence in primary neuronal cultures indicates that ADAM10 may represent the genuine constitutive alpha-secretase. Mainly because alpha-secretase cleaves APP within the sequence of Abeta, the core component of the cerebral amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease, alpha-secretase activation is considered to be of therapeutic value. In this article, we will provide a historical perspective on the characterization of alpha-secretase and review the recent literature on the identification and biology of the current alpha-secretase candidates.

22121920|t|Soluble Abeta oligomer production and toxicity.
22121920|a|For nearly 100 years following the first description of this neurological disorder by Dr Alois Alzheimer, amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles have been hypothesized to cause neuronal loss. With evidence that the extent of insoluble, deposited amyloid poorly correlated with cognitive impairment, research efforts focused on soluble forms of Abeta, also referred as Abeta oligomers. Following a decade of studies, soluble oligomeric forms of Abeta are now believed to induce the deleterious cascade(s) involved in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. In this review, we will discuss our current understanding about endogenous oligomeric Abeta production, their relative toxicity in vivo and in vitro, and explore the potential future directions needed for the field.

22121980|t|The role of metallobiology and amyloid-beta peptides in Alzheimer's disease.
22121980|a|The biggest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease is the process of ageing, but the mechanisms that lead to the manifestation of the disease remain to be elucidated. Why age triggers the disease is unclear but an emerging theme is the inability for a cell to efficiently maintain many key processes such as energy production, repair, and regenerative mechanisms. Metal ions are essential to the metabolic function of every cell. This review will explore the role and reported changes in metal ions in Alzheimer disease, particularly the brain, blood and cerebral spinal fluid, emphasizing how iron, copper and zinc may be involved through the interactions with amyloid precursor protein, the proteolytically cleaved peptide amyloid-beta (Abeta), and other related metalloproteins. Finally, we explore the monomeric makeup of possible Abeta dimers, what a dimeric Abeta species from Alzheimer's disease brain tissue is likely to be composed of, and discuss how metals may influence Abeta production and toxicity via a copper catalyzed dityrosine cross-link.

22122056|t|gamma-Secretase inhibitors and modulators for Alzheimer's disease.
22122056|a|gamma-Secretase is a membrane embedded aspartyl protease complex with presenilin as the catalytic component. Along with beta-secretase, this enzyme produces the amyloid beta-protein of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from the amyloid beta-protein precursor. Because of its key role in the pathogenesis of AD, gamma-secretase has been a prime target for drug discovery, and many inhibitors of this protease have been developed. The therapeutic potential of these inhibitors is virtually negated by the fact that gamma-secretase is an essential part of the Notch signaling pathway, rendering the compounds unacceptably toxic upon chronic exposure. However, these compounds have served as useful chemical tools for biological investigations. In contrast, gamma-secretase modulators continue to be of keen interest as possible AD therapeutics. These modulators either shift amyloid beta-protein production to shorter, less pathogenic peptides or inhibit the proteolysis of amyloid beta-protein precursor selectively compared to that of Notch. The various chemical types of inhibitors and modulators will be discussed, along with their use as probes for basic biology and their potential as AD therapeutics.

22122073|t|Assembly of the presenilin gamma-/epsilon-secretase complex.
22122073|a|The presenilin complex is composed of four core proteins (presenilin 1 or presenilin 2, APH1, nicastrin, and PEN2). Several endogenous proteins have been reported to selectively modulate the function of the presenilin complexes; these include transmembrane trafficking protein, 21-KD (TMP21), CD147 antigen (basigin), the gamma-secretase-activating protein (gSAP), and the orphan G-protein-coupled receptor 3. Because the structure and assembly of these complexes underlies their activity, this review will discuss current work on the assembly of the complex and on presenilin-interacting proteins that regulate secretase activity.

In this study, we review recent advances in the study of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease-associated synaptic dysfunction and memory deficits, and how these mechanisms could provide novel avenues for therapeutic intervention to treat this devastating neurodegenerative disease.

22122190|t|Cholinergic modulation of amyloid precursor protein processing with emphasis on M1 muscarinic receptor: perspectives and challenges in treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
22122190|a|The prescribed drugs for treatment of cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients are regarded as symptomatic drugs. Effective disease modifying therapies are not yet prescribed in AD patients. Three major hallmarks of AD (e.g. cholinergic hypofunction, Abeta and tau neuropathologies) are closely linked raising the expectation that restoring the cholinergic hypofunction to normal, in particular via selective activation of M1 muscarinic receptors, may alter the onset or progression of AD dementia. This review is focused mainly on modulation of amyloid precursor processing and Abeta levels in the brain via cholinergic treatment strategies based on M1 muscarinic agonists versus other cholinergic treatments (e.g. cholinesterase inhibitors prescribed for treatment of AD, M2 antagonists and nicotinic agonists). Advantages and potential drawbacks of these treatment modalities are reviewed versus the notion that due to an elusive etiology of AD, future disease modifiers should address comprehensively most of these AD hallmarks (e.g. Abeta pathology, tau and tangle pathologies, as well as the cholinergic hypofunction and cognitive impairments). This major requirement may be fulfilled with M1-selective muscarinic agonists and less with other reviewed cholinergic treatments.

22122230|t|Are amyloid-degrading enzymes viable therapeutic targets in Alzheimer's disease?
22122230|a|: The amyloid cascade hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease envisages that the initial elevation of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) levels, especially of Abeta(1-42) , is the primary trigger for the neuronal cell death specific to onset of Alzheimer's disease. There is now substantial evidence that brain amyloid levels are manipulable because of a dynamic equilibrium between their synthesis from the amyloid precursor protein and their removal by amyloid-degrading enzymes (ADEs) providing a potential therapeutic strategy. Since the initial reports over a decade ago that two zinc metallopeptidases, insulin-degrading enzyme and neprilysin (NEP), contributed to amyloid degradation in the brain, there is now an embarras de richesses in relation to this category of enzymes, which currently number almost 20. These now include serine and cysteine proteinases, as well as numerous zinc peptidases. The experimental validation for each of these enzymes, and which to target, varies enormously but up-regulation of several of them individually in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease has proved effective in amyloid and plaque clearance, as well as cognitive enhancement. The relative status of each of these enzymes will be critically evaluated. NEP and its homologues, as well as insulin-degrading enzyme, remain as principal ADEs and recently discovered mechanisms of epigenetic regulation of NEP expression potentially open new avenues in manipulation of AD-related genes, including ADEs.

22122349|t|Regulation of beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 gene expression and its role in Alzheimer's disease.
22122349|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder leading to dementia. Neuritic plaques are the hallmark neuropathology in AD brains. Proteolytic processing of amyloid-beta precursor protein at the beta site by beta-site amyloid-beta precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is essential to generate Abeta, a central component of the neuritic plaques. BACE1 is increased in some sporadic AD brains, and dysregulation of BACE1 gene expression plays an important role in AD pathogenesis. This review will focus on the regulation of BACE1 gene expression at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translation initiation, translational and post-translational levels, and its role in AD pathogenesis. Further studies on BACE1 gene expression regulation will greatly contribute to our understanding of AD pathogenesis and reveal potential novel approaches for AD prevention and drug development.

22122372|t|Proteolytic processing of Alzheimer's beta-amyloid precursor protein.
22122372|a|beta-Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). APP undergoes post-translational proteolysis/processing to generate the hydrophobic beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides. Deposition of Abeta in the brain, forming oligomeric Abeta and plaques, is identified as one of the key pathological hallmarks of AD. The processing of APP to generate Abeta is executed by beta- and gamma-secretase and is highly regulated. Abeta toxicity can lead to synaptic dysfunction, neuronal cell death, impaired learning/memory and abnormal behaviors in AD models in vitro and in vivo. Aside from Abeta, proteolytic cleavages of APP can also give rise to the APP intracellular domain, reportedly involved in multiple types of cellular events such as gene transcription and apoptotic cell death. In addition to amyloidogenic processing, APP can also be cleaved by alpha-secretase to form a soluble or secreted APP ectodomain (sAPP-alpha) that has been shown to be mostly neuro-protective. In this review, we describe the mechanisms involved in APP metabolism and the likely functions of its various proteolytic products to give a better understanding of the patho/physiological functions of APP.

22122663|t|The physiology of the beta-amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain AICD.
22122663|a|The amyloid-beta precursor protein (betaAPP) undergoes several cleavages by enzymatic activities called secretases. Numerous studies aimed at studying the biogenesis and catabolic fate of Abeta peptides, the proteinaceous component of the senile plaques that accumulate in Alzheimer's disease-affected brains. Relatively recently, another secretase-mediated beta-APP-derived catabolite called APP IntraCellular Domain (AICD) entered the game. Whether AICD corresponded to a biologically inert by-pass product of betaAPP processing or whether it could harbor its own function remained questionable. In this study, we review the mechanisms by which AICD is generated and how its production is regulated. Furthermore, we discuss the degradation mechanism underlying its rapid catabolic fate. Finally, we review putative AICD-related functions and more particularly, the numerous studies indicating that AICD could translocate to the nucleus and control at a transcriptional level, the expression of a series of proteins involved in various functions including the control of cell death and Abeta degradation.

22122681|t|Developing beta-secretase inhibitors for treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
22122681|a|beta-Secretase (memapsin 2; BACE-1) is the first protease in the processing of amyloid precursor protein leading to the production of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the brain. It is believed that high levels of brain Abeta are responsible for the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, beta-secretase is a major therapeutic target for the development of inhibitor drugs. During the past decade, steady progress has been made in the evolution of beta-secretase inhibitors toward better drug properties. Recent inhibitors are potent, selective and have been shown to penetrate the blood-brain barrier to inhibit Abeta levels in the brains of experimental animals. Moreover, continuous administration of a beta-secretase inhibitor was shown to rescue age-related cognitive decline in transgenic AD mice. A small number of beta-secretase inhibitors have also entered early phase clinical trials. These developments offer some optimism for the clinical development of a disease-modifying drug for AD.

22126319|a|BACKGROUND: Previous studies have extensively reported the deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide with carboxyl- and amino-terminal heterogeneity in cortical and cerebrovascular deposits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in non-human primates except baboons. METHODS: We examined the immunocytochemical distribution of Abeta peptides and Abeta oligomers in brain tissue from three subspecies of 18- to 28-year-old baboons (Papio) and in other monkeys including the squirrel (Saimiri sciureus) and rhesus (Macaca mulatta) for comparison. RESULTS: A general preponderance of Abeta(42) in parenchymal deposits and many vascular deposits in all cortical lobes was evident in the baboons. Abeta oligomeric immunoreactivity was also apparent like to amyloid plaques. We found that the amino acid sequence of the Abeta domain of the baboon amyloid precursor protein is similar to that of man. In contrast to Abeta, immunoreactivity to hyperphosphorylated tau protein was largely intracellular and rare in these baboons. Brain tissues from squirrel and rhesus monkeys examined in parallel exhibited mostly vascular and parenchymal deposits containing Abeta(42) peptides. Our results were comparable to AD, but showed that even in younger monkeys exhibiting few deposits, Abeta(42) was evident in both parenchymal deposits and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Perivascular amyloid deposits were frequent and often accompanied by microvascular abnormalities in the form of collapsed degenerated capillaries. CONCLUSIONS: Similar to other primates above and below in the phylogenetic order, our observations and evaluation of the literature implicate pathogenicity of Abeta(42) peptide associated with microvascular degeneration in baboons. We suggest baboons are useful animals to investigate the dynamics of AD-related pathology.

22129071|t|Template-assisted lateral growth of amyloid-beta42 fibrils studied by differential labeling with gold nanoparticles.
22129071|a|Amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) aggregation into amyloid fibrils is central to the origin and development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet this highly complex process is poorly understood at the molecular level. Extensive studies have shown that Abeta fibril growth occurs through fibril elongation, whereby soluble molecules add to the fibril ends. Nevertheless, fibril morphology strongly depends on aggregation conditions. For example, at high ionic strength, Abeta fibrils laterally associate into bundles. To further study the mechanisms leading to fibril growth, we developed a single-fibril growth assay based on differential labeling of two Abeta42 variants with gold nanoparticles. We used this assay to study Abeta42 fibril growth under different conditions and observed that bundle formation is preceded by lateral interaction of soluble Abeta42 molecules with pre-existing fibrils. Based on this data, we propose template-assisted lateral fibril growth as an additional mechanism to elongation for Abeta42 fibril growth.

22129278|t|DHA inhibits ER Ca2+ release and ER stress in astrocytes following in vitro ischemia.
22129278|a|Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has neuroprotective effects in several neurodegenerative disease conditions. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. In the present study, we investigated the effects of DHA on astrocyte Ca(2+) signaling under in vitro ischemic conditions (oxygen/glucose deprivation and reoxygenation, OGD/REOX). OGD (2h) triggered a Ca(2+) (ER) store overload (~1.9-fold). Ca(2+) uptake by the Ca(2+) (ER) stores was further augmented during REOX and Ca(2+) (ER) was elevated by ~4.7-fold at 90min REOX. Interestingly, Ca(2+) (ER) stores abruptly released Ca(2+) at ~120min REOX and emptied at 160min REOX. Depletion of Ca(2+) (ER) stores led to delayed elevation of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration (Ca(2+) (cyt) ) and cell death. Activation of the purinergic receptor P2Y1 was responsible for the release of Ca(2+) (ER) . Most importantly, DHA blocked the initial Ca(2+) (ER) store overload, the delayed depletion of Ca(2+) (ER) , and rise in Ca(2+) (cyt) , which was in part via inhibiting d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors. The DHA metabolite DiHDoHE exhibited similar effects. DHA also attenuated expression of phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha and activating transcription factor-4, two ER stress markers, following in vitro ischemia. Taken together, these findings suggest that DHA has protective effects in astrocytes following in vitro ischemia, in part, by inhibiting Ca(2+) dysregulation and ER stress.

22129351|t|Dihydroxybenzoic acid isomers differentially dissociate soluble biotinyl-Abeta(1-42) oligomers.
22129351|a|Polyphenolic compounds including a number of natural products such as resveratrol, curcumin, catechin derivatives, and nordihydroguaiaretic acid have effects on the assembly of Abeta fibrils and oligomers as well as on fibril morphology. Based on a lead structure obtained from a screen of a small molecule diversity library, simple benzoic acid derivatives distinguished by the number and position of hydroxyls on the aromatic ring displayed different abilities to dissociate preformed biotinyl-Abeta(1-42) oligomers. The 2,3-, 2,5-, and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA) isomers were active oligomer dissociators. The remaining DHBA isomers and the monohydroxy and unsubstituted benzoic acids were inactive and did not compete with the active compounds to block oligomer dissociation. None of the compounds blocked oligomer assembly, indicating that they do not interact with monomeric Abeta to shift the oligomer-monomer equilibrium. Dissociating activity was not associated with quinone redox cycling capacity of the compounds. Gallic acid (3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid) stabilized biotinyl-Abeta(1-42) oligomers against intrinsic dissociation and blocked the effects of the active dissociators, independent of the concentration of dissociator. A model for the mechanism of action of the DHBA dissociators proposes that these compounds destabilize oligomer structure promoting progressive monomer dissociation rather than fissioning oligomers into smaller, but still macromolecular, species. Gallic acid blocks dissociation by stabilizing oligomers against this process.

22129783|t|FOXP2, APOE, and PRNP: new modulators in primary progressive aphasia.
22129783|a|Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by progressive language impairment. Polymorphisms within forkhead box P2 gene (FOXP2) gene have been associated with speech and language impairment. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype and PRNP 129 codon status have been demonstrated to increase the risk of PPA, but with contrasting results. In the present study, we have evaluated the impact of FOXP2, APOE and PRNP genetic variations as risk factors and/or disease-modulators in PPA. 94 PPA patients and 200 age-matched healthy controls were considered and FOXP2 polymorphisms (rs1456031, rs17137124), APOE genotype, and PRNP codon 129 polymorphism analyzed. In 34 PPA patients, SPECT imaging data were analyzed by Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8). Genetic distributions and allele frequencies of FOXP2 and PRNP polymorphisms did not differ between groups while APOE epsilon4 was more represented in PPA as compared to controls. PPA patients carrying at-risk FOXP2 polymorphisms (rs1456031 and/or rs17137124) showed greater hypoperfusion in the frontal areas, namely the left inferior frontal gyrus and the right cingulated gyrus compared to non-carriers (p < 0.005). PPA patients carrying at least one epsilon4 allele had greater hypoperfusion in orbitofrontal regions (superior frontal gyrus and orbital gyrus) as compared to non-carriers epsilon4 (p < 0.005). PRNP codon 129 homozigosity correlated with left frontotemporal hypoperfusion (p < 0.005). Genetic variations within FOXP2, APOE, and PRNP modulate PPA disease, leading to a specific regional hypoperfusion according to different molecular pathways. APOE epsilon4 is overrepresented in PPA, thus likely acting as genetic risk factor on disease development.

22130659|t|Dynamics of amyloid beta fibrils revealed by solid-state NMR.
22130659|a|We have investigated the site-specific backbone dynamics of mature amyloid beta (Abeta) fibrils using solid-state NMR spectroscopy. Overall, the known beta-sheet segments and the turn linking these two beta-strands exhibit high order parameters between 0.8 and 0.95, suggesting low conformational flexibility. The first approximately eight N-terminal and the last C-terminal residues exhibit lower order parameters between ~0.4 and 0.8. Interestingly, the order parameters increase again for the first two residues, Asp(1) and Ala(2), suggesting that the N terminus could carry some structural importance.

22130662|t|Apolipoprotein E promotes beta-amyloid trafficking and degradation by modulating microglial cholesterol levels.
22130662|a|Allelic variation in the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is the major risk factor of sporadic Alzheimer disease. ApoE is the primary cholesterol carrier in the brain. Previously, we demonstrated that intracellular degradation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides by microglia is dramatically enhanced in the presence of apoE. However, the molecular mechanisms subserving this effect remain unknown. This study reports a mechanistic link between apoE-regulated cholesterol homeostasis and Abeta degradation. We demonstrate that promoting intracellular Abeta degradation by microglia is a common feature of HDL apolipoproteins, including apoE and apoA-I. This effect was not dependent on the direct interaction of apoE and Abeta. Regulation of Abeta degradation was achieved by solely manipulating cellular cholesterol levels. The expression and the activity of Abeta degrading enzymes, however, were not regulated by cholesterol. We observed that reducing cellular cholesterol levels by apoE resulted in faster delivery of Abeta to lysosomes and enhanced degradation. Moreover, apoE facilitated the recycling of Rab7, a small GTPase responsible for recruiting the motor complex to late endosomes/lysosomes. These data indicate that faster endocytic trafficking of Abeta-containing vesicles in the presence of apoE resulted from efficient recycling of Rab7 from lysosomes to early endosomes. Thus, apoE-induced intracellular Abeta degradation is mediated by the cholesterol efflux function of apoE, which lowers cellular cholesterol levels and subsequently facilitates the intracellular trafficking of Abeta to lysosomes for degradation. These findings demonstrate a direct role of cholesterol in the intracellular Abeta degradation.

22133042|t|Hydrophobicity and conformational change as mechanistic determinants for nonspecific modulators of amyloid beta self-assembly.
22133042|a|The link between many neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and the aberrant folding and aggregation of proteins has prompted a comprehensive search for small organic molecules that have the potential to inhibit such processes. Although many compounds have been reported to affect the formation of amyloid fibrils and/or other types of protein aggregates, the mechanisms by which they act are not well understood. A large number of compounds appear to act in a nonspecific way affecting several different amyloidogenic proteins. We describe here a detailed study of the mechanism of action of one representative compound, lacmoid, in the context of the inhibition of the aggregation of the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) associated with Alzheimer's disease. We show that lacmoid binds Abeta(1-40) in a surfactant-like manner and counteracts the formation of all types of Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) aggregates. On the basis of these and previous findings, we are able to rationalize the molecular mechanisms of action of nonspecific modulators of protein self-assembly in terms of hydrophobic attraction and the conformational preferences of the polypeptide.

22133278|t|Amyloid-beta oligomers stimulate microglia through a tyrosine kinase dependent mechanism.
22133278|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been well characterized by the presence of reactive microglia, often associated with beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaque deposition. The oligomeric form of Abeta peptide (Abeta(o)) has neurotoxic effects in the presence of microglia and is suggested to potentiate proinflammatory changes in microglia in AD. Primary murine microglia cultures stimulated with Abeta(o) displayed increased protein phosphotyrosine and secreted tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha levels which were attenuated by the Src/Abl inhibitor, dasatinib. Intracerebroventricular infusions of Abeta(o) into C57BL6/J mice stimulated increased microgliosis and protein phosphotyrosine levels that were also attenuated by dasatinib administration. The rodent findings were validated in human AD brains versus age-matched controls demonstrating reactive microglial association with Abeta(o) deposits and increased microglial protein phosphotyrosine and phospho-Src levels. These data suggest a role for Abeta(o) in microglial activation through a tyrosine kinase-dependant pathway both in rodent models and human disease. Use of a selective nonreceptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor such as dasatinib to attenuate microglial-dependent proinflammatory changes may prove to be an important step toward developing anti-inflammatory treatments for AD.

22133762|t|Overexpression of amyloid-beta protein precursor induces mitochondrial oxidative stress and activates the intrinsic apoptotic cascade.
22133762|a|Aberrant processing of amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) into amyloid-beta (Abeta) fragments underlies the formation of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Moreover, Abeta fragments, particularly Abeta(42), exert direct toxic effects within neurons including the induction of mitochondrial oxidative stress (MOS). Interestingly, individuals with Down syndrome (DS) frequently develop early onset AD as a major co-morbid phenotype. One hypothesis for AD associated with DS involves the overexpression of wild type (WT) AbetaPP protein, due to its location on chromosome 21. However, the mechanism by which the overexpression of WT AbetaPP might trigger MOS and induce cell death is presently unclear. Here we show that transient overexpression of DsRed2-tagged AbetaPP (WT) in CHO cells induces caspase-3 activation and nuclear fragmentation indicative of apoptosis. AbetaPP localizes to the mitochondrial fraction of transfected CHO cells and induces glutathione-sensitive opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) and cytochrome c release. MOS and intrinsic apoptosis induced by AbetaPP are significantly inhibited by co-expression of Bcl-2 or treatment with either glutathione or a pan-caspase inhibitor. The mPTP inhibitor, cyclosporin A, also significantly attenuates AbetaPP-induced apoptosis. AbetaPP-induced apoptosis is unaffected by a beta-secretase inhibitor and is independent of detectable Abeta(42); however, a gamma-secretase inhibitor significantly protects against AbetaPP overexpression, suggesting a possible role of the AbetaPP intracellular domain in cell death. These data indicate that overexpression of WT AbetaPP is sufficient to induce MOS and intrinsic apoptosis, suggesting a novel pro-oxidant role for AbetaPP at mitochondria which may be relevant in AD and DS disease pathologies.

22134919|t|Comparative lipidomic analysis of mouse and human brain with Alzheimer disease.
22134919|a|Lipids are key regulators of brain function and have been increasingly implicated in neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer disease (AD). Here, a systems-based approach was employed to determine the lipidome of brain tissues affected by AD. Specifically, we used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to profile extracts from the prefrontal cortex, entorhinal cortex, and cerebellum of late-onset AD (LOAD) patients, as well as the forebrain of three transgenic familial AD (FAD) mouse models. Although the cerebellum lacked major alterations in lipid composition, we found an elevation of a signaling pool of diacylglycerol as well as sphingolipids in the prefrontal cortex of AD patients. Furthermore, the diseased entorhinal cortex showed specific enrichment of lysobisphosphatidic acid, sphingomyelin, the ganglioside GM3, and cholesterol esters, all of which suggest common pathogenic mechanisms associated with endolysosomal storage disorders. Importantly, a significant increase in cholesterol esters and GM3 was recapitulated in the transgenic FAD models, suggesting that these mice are relevant tools to study aberrant lipid metabolism of endolysosomal dysfunction associated with AD. Finally, genetic ablation of phospholipase D(2), which rescues the synaptic and behavioral deficits of an FAD mouse model, fully normalizes GM3 levels. These data thus unmask a cross-talk between the metabolism of phosphatidic acid, the product of phospholipase D(2), and gangliosides, and point to a central role of ganglioside anomalies in AD pathogenesis. Overall, our study highlights the hypothesis generating potential of lipidomics and identifies novel region-specific lipid anomalies potentially linked to AD pathogenesis.

22138241|t|The iAbeta5p beta-breaker peptide regulates the Abeta(25-35) interaction with lipid bilayers through a cholesterol-mediated mechanism.
22138241|a|Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the deposition of aggregates of the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) in the brain. A potential therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease is the use of synthetic beta-sheet breaker peptides, which are capable of binding Abeta but unable to become part of a beta-sheet structure, thus inhibiting the peptide aggregation. Many studies suggest that membranes play a key role in the Abeta aggregation; consequently, it is strategic to investigate the interplay between beta-sheet breaker peptides and Abeta in the presence of lipid bilayers. In this work, we focused on the effect of the beta-sheet breaker peptide acetyl-LPFFD-amide, iAbeta5p, on the interaction of the Abeta(25-35) fragment with lipid membranes, studied by Electron Spin Resonance spectroscopy, using spin-labeled membrane components (either phospholipids or cholesterol). The ESR results show that iAbeta5p influences the Abeta(25-35) interaction with the bilayer through a cholesterol-mediated mechanism: iAbeta5p withholds cholesterol in the inner hydrophobic core of the bilayer, making the interfacial region more fluid and capable to accommodate Abeta(25-35). As a consequence, iAbeta5p prevents the Abeta(25-35) release from the lipid membrane, which is the first step of the beta-amyloid aggregation process.

22138302|t|Preferential interactions between ApoE-containing lipoproteins and Abeta revealed by a detection method that combines size exclusion chromatography with non-reducing gel-shift.
22138302|a|The association between apolipoprotein E (apoE) and amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) may significantly impact the function of both proteins, thus affecting the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, apoE/Abeta interactions remain fundamentally defined by the stringency of the detection method. Here we use size exclusion chromatography (SEC) as a non-stringent approach to the detection of apoE/Abeta interactions in solution, specifically apoE and both endogenous and exogenous Abeta from plasma, CSF and astrocyte conditioned media. By SEC analysis, Abeta association with plasma and CNS lipoproteins is apoE-dependent. While endogenous Abeta elutes to specific human plasma lipoproteins distinct from those containing apoE, it is the apoE-containing lipoproteins that absorb excess amounts of exogenous Abeta40. In human CSF, apoE, endogenous Abeta and phospholipid elute in an almost identical profile, as do apoE, exogenous Abeta and phospholipid from astrocyte conditioned media. Combining SEC fractionation with subsequent analysis for SDS-stable apoE/Abeta complex reveals that apoE-containing astrocyte lipoproteins exhibit the most robust interactions with Abeta. Thus, standardization of the methods for detecting apoE/Abeta complex is necessary to determine its functional significance in the neuropathology characteristic of AD. Importantly, a systematic understanding of the role of apoE-containing plasma and CNS lipoproteins in Abeta homeostasis could potentially contribute to identifying a plasma biomarker currently over-looked because it has multiple components.

22139836|t|Sublethal doses of beta-amyloid peptide abrogate DNA-dependent protein kinase activity.
22139836|a|Accumulation of DNA damage and deficiency in DNA repair potentially contribute to the progressive neuronal loss in neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer disease (AD). In multicellular eukaryotes, double strand breaks (DSBs), the most lethal form of DNA damage, are mainly repaired by the nonhomologous end joining pathway, which relies on DNA-PK complex activity. Both the presence of DSBs and a decreased end joining activity have been reported in AD brains, but the molecular player causing DNA repair dysfunction is still undetermined. beta-Amyloid (Abeta), a potential proximate effector of neurotoxicity in AD, might exert cytotoxic effects by reactive oxygen species generation and oxidative stress induction, which may then cause DNA damage. Here, we show that in PC12 cells sublethal concentrations of aggregated Abeta(25-35) inhibit DNA-PK kinase activity, compromising DSB repair and sensitizing cells to nonlethal oxidative injury. The inhibition of DNA-PK activity is associated with down-regulation of the catalytic subunit DNA-PK (DNA-PKcs) protein levels, caused by oxidative stress and reversed by antioxidant treatment. Moreover, we show that sublethal doses of Abeta(1-42) oligomers enter the nucleus of PC12 cells, accumulate as insoluble oligomeric species, and reduce DNA-PK kinase activity, although in the absence of oxidative stress. Overall, these findings suggest that Abeta mediates inhibition of the DNA-PK-dependent nonhomologous end joining pathway contributing to the accumulation of DSBs that, if not efficiently repaired, may lead to the neuronal loss observed in AD.

22142973|t|Mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.
22142973|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, affecting 35 million people today. The search for new treatments is made ever more urgent by prospects for increasing prevalence due to population aging. Mouse models are one of the most important research tools for finding new treatments for AD. Here, we review those models. We begin by briefly reviewing the AD genetics on which mouse models are based and then consider the most common mouse models of AD, including mice transgenic for human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) and beta-amyloid (Abeta), mice expressing mutant presenilin genes, mice modeling tau's role in AD, and apolipoprotein E models. The discussion highlights key features and important differences between these mouse models. We conclude with a discussion about the role of AD mouse models in the translational pipeline.

22144675|t|Amyloid precursor protein revisited: neuron-specific expression and highly stable nature of soluble derivatives.
22144675|a|APP processing and amyloid-beta production play a central role in Alzheimer disease pathogenesis. APP has been considered a ubiquitously expressed protein. In addition to amyloid-beta, alpha- or beta-secretase-dependent cleavage of APP also generates soluble secreted APP (APPsalpha or APPsbeta, respectively). Interestingly, APPsbeta has been shown to be subject to further cleavage to create an N-APP fragment that binds to the DR6 death receptor and mediates axon pruning and degeneration under trophic factor withdrawal conditions. By performing APP immunocytochemical staining, we found that, unexpectedly, many antibodies yielded nonspecific staining in APP-null samples. Screening of a series of antibodies allowed us to identify a rabbit monoclonal antibody Y188 that is highly specific for APP and prompted us to re-examine the expression, localization, and stability of endogenous APP and APPsbeta in wild-type and in APPsbeta knock-in mice, respectively. In contrast to earlier studies, we found that APP is specifically expressed in neurons and that its expression cannot be detected in major types of glial cells under basal or neuroinflammatory conditions. Both APPsalpha and APPsbeta are highly stable in the central nervous system (CNS) and do not undergo further cleavage with or without trophic factor support. Our results clarify several key questions with regard to the fundamental properties of APP and offer critical cellular insights into the pathophysiology of APP.

22147283|t|Sesaminol glucosides protect beta-amyloid induced apoptotic cell death by regulating redox system in SK-N-SH cells.
22147283|a|We have investigated the neuroprotective effect of sesaminol glucosides (SG) in SK-N-SH cells. SG prevented apoptotic cell death induced by Abeta25-35. In parallel, SK-N-SH cells exposed to Abeta25-35 underwent oxidative stress as shown by the elevated level of intracellular ROS, lipid peroxidation, and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) formation, which were effectively suppressed by SG treatment. Furthermore, SG reversed the activities of catalase and glutathione peroxidase, and restored intracellular GSH levels in Abeta25-35 challenged SK-N-SH cells. In addition, SG inhibited not only Abeta25-35-induced apoptotic features including cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, activation of caspase-3, and activation of caspase-9, but also elevated Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in SK-N-SH cells treated with Abeta25-35. It was also observed that Abeta25-35 stimulated the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including extracellular protein regulated protein kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAP kinase. SG inhibited phosphorylation of the JNK, ERK and p38 MAP kinase. These results suggest that SG has a protective effect against Abeta25-35-induced neuronal apoptosis, possibly through scavenging oxidative stress and regulating MAPKs signaling pathways.

22147523|t|Secreted amyloid precursor proteins promote proliferation and glial differentiation of adult hippocampal neural progenitor cells.
22147523|a|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is an integral membrane glycoprotein present at high levels in nerve cells. Two soluble secreted forms, sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta, are processed from APP by two mutually exclusive proteolytic pathways. sAPPalpha shows a range of neuroprotective and growth factor properties, including reduction of neuronal injury and improvement in memory performance, in contrast to the generally less potent sAPPbeta. In addition, sAPPalpha has been shown to increase the proliferation of both embryonic neural stem cells and neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the adult brain. However, an effect of sAPPalpha (or sAPPbeta) on adult hippocampal progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation has not previously been observed. In this study, we examined the effect of both the alpha- and beta-cleaved ectodomains of sAPP on adult NPCs isolated from the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the rat hippocampus in the presence or absence of depolarizing conditions. Assays were performed to examine the effect of sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta on SGZ-derived adult NPC proliferation in parallel with SVZ-derived cells and on differentiation with SGZ-derived cells. We observed both sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta increased the proliferation of SGZ-derived NPCs in vitro. Further, treatment of SGZ-derived NPCs with either sAPPalpha or sAPPbeta increased the number of cells expressing the astrocytic marker GFAP and promoted cell survival. The effect on differential fate was observed in both the presence and absence of depolarizing conditions. Thus, both sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta exert a complex range of effects on SGZ-derived adult NPCs, including increasing NPC proliferation, maintaining cell viability, yet promoting glial over neuronal differentiation. These findings provide the first direct support for the secreted forms of APP regulating SGZ-derived NPCs, and raise the possibility some or all of the effects may have therapeutic benefit in models of neurological disease.

22148916|t|Dynamics of Zn(II) binding as a key feature in the formation of amyloid fibrils by Abeta11-28.
22148916|a|Supramolecular assembly of peptides and proteins into amyloid fibrils is of multifold interest, going from materials science to physiopathology. The binding of metal ions to amyloidogenic peptides is associated with several amyloid diseases, and amyloids with incorporated metal ions are of interest in nanotechnology. Understanding the mechanisms of amyloid formation and the role of metal ions can improve strategies toward the prevention of this process and enable potential applications in nanotechnology. Here, studies on Zn(II) binding to the amyloidogenic peptide Abeta11-28 are reported. Zn(II) modulates the Abeta11-28 aggregation, in terms of kinetics and fibril structures. Structural studies suggest that Abeta11-28 binds Zn(II) by amino acid residues Glu11 and His14 and that Zn(II) is rapidly exchanged between peptides. Structural and aggregation data indicate that Zn(II) binding induces the formation of the dimeric Zn(II)(1)(Abeta11-28)(2) species, which is the building block of fibrillar aggregates and explains why Zn(II) binding accelerates Abeta11-28 aggregation. Moreover, transient Zn(II) binding, even briefly, was enough to promote fibril formation, but the final structure resembled that of apo-Abeta11-28 amyloids. Also, seeding experiments, i.e., the addition of fibrillar Zn(II)(1)(Abeta11-28)(2) to the apo-Abeta11-28 peptide, induced aggregation but not propagation of the Zn(II)(1)(Abeta11-28)(2)-type fibrils. This can be explained by the dynamic Zn(II) binding between soluble and aggregated Abeta11-28. As a consequence, dynamic Zn(II) binding has a strong impact on the aggregation behavior of the Abeta11-28 peptide and might be a relevant and so far little regarded parameter in other systems of metal ions and amyloidogenic peptides.

22150318|t|Macromolecular and small-molecule modulation of intracellular Abeta42 aggregation and associated toxicity.
22150318|a|Abeta (amyloid beta-peptide) has a central role in AD (Alzheimer's disease) where neuronal toxicity is linked to its extracellular and intracellular accumulation as oligomeric species. Searching for molecules that attenuate Abeta aggregation could uncover novel therapies for AD, but most studies in mammalian cells have inferred aggregation indirectly by assessing levels of secreted Abeta peptide. In the present study we establish a mammalian cell system for the direct visualization of Abeta formation by expression of an Abeta(42)-EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) fusion protein in the human embryonic kidney cell line T-REx293, and use this to identify both macromolecules and small molecules that reduce aggregation and associated cell toxicity. Thus a molecular shield protein AavLEA1 [Aphelenchus avenae LEA (late embryogenesis abundant) protein 1], which limits aggregation of proteins with expanded poly(Q) repeats, is also effective against Abeta(42)-EGFP when co-expressed in T-REx293 cells. A screen of polysaccharide and small organic molecules from medicinal plants and fungi reveals one candidate in each category, PS5 (polysaccharide 5) and ganoderic acid DM respectively, with activity against Abeta. Both PS5 and ganoderic acid DM probably promote Abeta aggregate clearance indirectly through the proteasome. The model is therefore of value to study the effects of intracellular Abeta on cell physiology and to identify reagents that counteract those effects.

22155633|t|Inhibiting effect of alpha(s1)-casein on Abeta(1-40) fibrillogenesis.
22155633|a|BACKGROUND: alpha(s1)-Casein is one of the four types of caseins, the largest protein component of bovine milk. The lack of a compact folded conformation and the capability to form micelles suggest a relationship of alpha(s1)-casein with the class of the intrinsically disordered (or natively unfolded) proteins. These proteins are known to exert a stabilizing activity on biomolecules through specific interaction with hydrophobic surfaces. In the present work we focused on the effect of alpha(s1)-casein on the fibrillogenesis of 1-40 beta-amyloid peptide, involved in Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: The aggregation kinetics of beta-peptide in presence and absence of alpha(s1)-casein was followed under shear at 37 C by recording the Thioflavine fluorescence, usually taken as an indicator of fibers formation. Measurements of Static and Dynamic Light Scattering, Circular Dichroism, and AFM imaging were done to reveal the details of alpha(s1)-casein-Abeta(1-40) interaction. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS: alpha(s1)-Casein addition sizably increases the lag-time of the nucleation phase and slows down the entire fibrillization process. alpha(s1)-Casein sequesters the amyloid peptide on its surface thus exerting a chaperone-like activity by means a colloidal inhibition mechanism. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Insights on the working mechanism of natural chaperones in preventing or controlling the amyloid aggregation.

22156046|t|Bispecific tandem single chain antibody simultaneously inhibits beta-secretase and promotes alpha-secretase processing of AbetaPP.
22156046|a|Misfolding and aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) is an important early event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Abeta is produced by sequential proteolysis of the amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) by beta- and gamma-secretases. A third protease, alpha-secretase, cleaves AbetaPP in the middle of the Abeta sequence precluding formation of Abeta. The levels of Abeta generated from AbetaPP can therefore be controlled by tailoring activity of these proteases toward AbetaPP. We previously showed that beta-secretase proteolysis of AbetaPP could be selectively inhibited using the single chain antibody fragment (scFv) iBSEC1, which blocks the cleavage site on AbetaPP, and alpha-secretase proteolysis of AbetaPP could be selectively enhanced using a proteolytic scFv (Asec1A) engineered to have alpha-secretase-like activity. Here we show that DIA10D, a novel tandem bispecific scFv combining iBSEC1 with the ASec1A can control amyloidogenic processing of AbetaPP by simultaneously inhibiting beta-secretase and increasing alpha-secretase processing of AbetaPP. When expressed in H4 (neuroglioma) cells overexpressing AbetaPP, DIA10D potently reduces levels of extracellular Abeta by around 50% while also increasing levels of neuroprotective sAbetaPPalpha. DIA10D activity has been designed to selectively target AbetaPP, so this modulation of AbetaPP processing should not affect endogenous activity of alpha-and beta-secretases towards other substrates.

22156047|t|Methods for analysis of amyloid-beta aggregates.
22156047|a|Amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) accumulation is one of the major hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease and plays a crucial role in its pathogenesis. Abeta aggregates into fibrils, but rather than these end-products of the aggregation process, intermediate species, referred to as oligomers, have been identified as the most neurotoxic Abeta aggregates. To characterize the different Abeta species and to study the aggregation process, a wide range of techniques has been applied over the past years. These techniques aim to visualize the different Abeta species and study their structure, to separate them, and to quantify the aggregated Abeta forms by immunology-based methods. In this review, we provide an overview and discussion of the most important techniques used for these aims. Often a combination of techniques will be appropriate to obtain the most optimal information.

22156048|t|Amyloid imaging with AV45 ((18)F-florbetapir) in a cognitively normal AbetaPP duplication carrier.
22156048|a|We report the case of a 62-year-old asymptomatic carrier of AbetaPP gene duplication. He was investigated by MRI and the amyloid ligand (18)F-AV45, and compared to Alzheimer's disease patients (n = 11) and healthy controls (n = 11). The neuropsychological examination was normal. Cortical thickness and AV45 retention were comparable to Alzheimer's disease patients. AbetaPP duplication was diagnosed because cerebral amyloid angiopathy and Alzheimer's disease pathology were found on the neuropathological examination of his youngest brother, who died at 42 from intracerebral hemorrhage. This is the first description of a pre-symptomatic AbetaPP duplication carrier over 60, despite widespread cerebral amyloid angiopathy, "Alzheimer's like" atrophy, and amyloid deposition.

22156579|t|A critical role for the PAR-1/MARK-tau axis in mediating the toxic effects of Abeta on synapses and dendritic spines.
22156579|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease and the leading cause of dementia in the elderly. Accumulating evidence supports soluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers as the leading candidate for the causative agent in AD and synapses as the primary site of Abeta oligomer action. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which Abeta oligomers cause synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairments remain poorly understood. Using primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons as a model system, we show that the partitioning defective-1 (PAR-1)/microtubule affinity-regulating kinase (MARK) family kinases act as critical mediators of Abeta toxicity on synapses and dendritic spines. Overexpression of MARK4 led to tau hyperphosphorylation, reduced expression of synaptic markers, and loss of dendritic spines and synapses, phenotypes also observed after Abeta treatment. Importantly, expression of a non-phosphorylatable form of tau with the PAR-1/MARK site mutated blocked the synaptic toxicity induced by MARK4 overexpression or Abeta treatment. To probe the involvement of endogenous MARK kinases in mediating the synaptic toxicity of Abeta, we employed a peptide inhibitor capable of effectively and specifically inhibiting the activities of all PAR-1/MARK family members. This inhibitor abrogated the toxic effects of Abeta oligomers on dendritic spines and synapses as assayed at the morphological and electrophysiological levels. Our results reveal a critical role for PAR-1/MARK kinases in AD pathogenesis and suggest PAR-1/MARK inhibitors as potential therapeutics for AD and possibly other tauopathies where aberrant tau hyperphosphorylation is involved.

22156755|t|Cerebrospinal fluid proteins predict longitudinal hippocampal degeneration in early-stage dementia of the Alzheimer type.
22156755|a|OBJECTIVE: Biomarkers are needed to improve the sensitivity and accuracy of diagnosis, and also prognosis, in individuals with early Alzheimer disease (AD). Measures of brain structure and disease-related proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been proposed as biomarkers, yet relatively little is known about the relationships between such measures. The present study was conducted to assess the relationship between CSF Abeta and tau protein levels and longitudinal measures of hippocampal structure in individuals with and without very mild dementia of the Alzheimer type. DESIGN: A single CSF sample and longitudinal magnetic resonance scans were collected. The CSF samples were assayed for tau, phosphorylated tau181 (p-tau181), Abeta1-42, and Abeta1-40 using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Large-deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping was used to generate hippocampal surfaces, and a composite hippocampal surface (previously constructed from 86 healthy participants) was used as a structural reference. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Thirteen participants with very mild AD (Clinical Dementia Rating, CDR 0.5) and 11 cognitively normal participants (CDR 0). INTERVENTION: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Initial and rate-of-change measures of total hippocampal volume and displacement of the hippocampal surface within zones overlying the CA1, subiculum, and CA2-4+DG cellular subfields, and their correlations with initial CSF measures. RESULTS: Lower CSF Alphabeta1-42 levels and higher tau/Alphabeta1-42 and p-tau181/Alphabeta1-42 ratios were strongly correlated with decreases in hippocampal volume and measures of progressive inward deformations of the CA1 subfield in participants with early AD, but not in cognitively normal participants. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the small sample size, we found that Alphabeta1-42 related and tau-related CSF measures were associated with hippocampal degeneration in individuals with clinically diagnosed early AD and may reflect an association with a common underlying disease mechanism.

22157615|t|Butyrylcholinesterase is associated with beta-amyloid plaques in the transgenic APPSWE/PSEN1dE9 mouse model of Alzheimer disease.
22157615|a|Histochemical analysis of Alzheimer disease (AD) brain tissues indicates that butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) is present in beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques. The role of BuChE in AD pathology is unknown, but an animal model developing similar BuChE-associated Abeta plaques could provide insights. The APPSWE/PSEN1dE9 transgenic mouse (ADTg), which develops Abeta plaques, was examined to determine if BuChE associates with these plaques, as in AD. We found that in mature ADTg mice, BuChE activity associated with Abeta plaques. The Abeta-, thioflavin-S- and BuChE-positive plaques mainly accumulated in the olfactory structures, cerebral cortex, hippocampal formation, amygdala, and cerebellum. No plaques were stained for acetylcholinesterase activity. The distribution and abundance of plaque staining in ADTg closely resembled many aspects of plaque staining in AD. Butyrylcholinesterase staining consistently showed fewer plaques than were detected with Abeta immunostaining but a greater number of plaques than were visualized with thioflavin-S. Double-labeling experiments demonstrated that all BuChE-positive plaques were Abeta positive, whereas only some BuChE-positive plaques were thioflavin-S positive. These observations suggest that BuChE is associated with a subpopulation of Abeta plaques and may play a role in AD plaque maturation. A further study of this animal model could clarify the role of BuChE in AD pathology.

22157754|t|Structural basis for increased toxicity of pathological abeta42:abeta40 ratios in Alzheimer disease.
22157754|a|The beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) is directly related to neurotoxicity in Alzheimer disease (AD). The two most abundant alloforms of the peptide co-exist under normal physiological conditions in the brain in an Abeta(42):Abeta(40) ratio of ~1:9. This ratio is often shifted to a higher percentage of Abeta(42) in brains of patients with familial AD and this has recently been shown to lead to increased synaptotoxicity. The molecular basis for this phenomenon is unclear. Although the aggregation characteristics of Abeta(40) and Abeta(42) individually are well established, little is known about the properties of mixtures. We have explored the biophysical and structural properties of physiologically relevant Abeta(42):Abeta(40) ratios by several techniques. We show that Abeta(40) and Abeta(42) directly interact as well as modify the behavior of the other. The structures of monomeric and fibrillar assemblies formed from Abeta(40) and Abeta(42) mixtures do not differ from those formed from either of these peptides alone. Instead, the co-assembly of Abeta(40) and Abeta(42) influences the aggregation kinetics by altering the pattern of oligomer formation as evidenced by a unique combination of solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, high molecular weight mass spectrometry, and cross-seeding experiments. We relate these observations to the observed enhanced toxicity of relevant ratios of Abeta(42):Abeta(40) in synaptotoxicity assays and in AD patients.

22159001|t|Coordination of copper(II) ions by the fragments of neuropeptide gamma containing D1, H9, H12 residues and products of copper-catalyzed oxidation.
22159001|a|A potentiometric, spectroscopic (UV-Vis, CD and EPR) and mass spectrometric (ESI-MS) study of Cu(II) binding to the (1-2,7-21)NPG, Asp(1)-Ala-Ile(7)-Ser-His(9)-Lys-Arg-His(12)-Lys-Thr-Asp-Ser-Phe-Val-Gly-Leu-Met(21)-NH(2), and Ac-(1-2,7-21)NPG, Ac-Asp(1)-Ala-Ile(7)-Ser-His(9)-Lys-Arg-His(12)-Lys-Thr-Asp-Ser-Phe-Val-Gly-Leu-Met(21)-NH(2), fragments of neuropeptide gamma were carried out. The results clearly indicate the stabilization of the 1 N {NH(2), beta-COO(-)}, 2 N {NH(2), beta-COO(-), N(Im)} and 3 N {NH(2), beta-COO(-), 2N(Im)} complexes by the coordination of the beta-carboxylate group of the D(1) residue. For the (1-2,7-21)NPG the CuH(2)L complex with 3 N {NH(2), beta-COO(-), 2N(Im)}, the binding mode dominates in a wide pH range of 4-8.5. With the sequential increase of pH, deprotonated amide nitrogens are involved in copper coordination. For the Ac-(1-2,7-21)NPG peptide the imidazole nitrogen atoms are the primary metal binding sites forming macrochelates in the pH range 4 to 7. The CuHL complex with 4 N {N(Im), N(-), N(-), N(Im)} coordination mode is formed in pH range 6-9. Deprotonation and co-ordination of the third amide nitrogen were detected at pH ~8.6. Metal-catalyzed oxidation (MCO) of proteins is mainly a site-specific process in which one or a few amino acids at metal-binding sites on the protein are preferentially oxidized. To elucidate the products of the copper(II)-catalyzed oxidation of the (1-2,7-21)NPG and Ac-(1-2,7-21)NPG, the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method and Cu(II)/hydrogen peroxide as a model oxidizing system were employed. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide with 1 : 4 peptide-H(2)O(2) molar ratio for the Ac-(1-2,7-21)NPG peptide the oxidation of the methionine residue to methionine sulfoxide and for (1-2,7-21)NPG to sulfone was observed. For the Cu(II)-peptide-hydrogen peroxide in 1 : 1 : 4 molar ratio systems, oxidation of the histidine residues to 2-oxohistidines was detected. Under experimental conditions the (1-2,7-21)NPG and Ac-(1-2,7-21)NPG undergo fragmentations by cleavage of the S(8)-H(9), H(9)-K(10), R(11)-H(12) and H(12)-K(13) peptide bonds supporting the participation of the H(9) and H(12) residues in the coordination of copper(II) ions. For the (1-2,7-21)NPG peptide chain the involvement of the D(1) residue in the coordination of metal ions is supported by the alkoxyl radical modification of this amino acid residue.

22159144|t|Histidine-rich branched peptides as Cu(II) and Zn(II) chelators with potential therapeutic application in Alzheimer's disease.
22159144|a|Two histidine-rich branched peptides with one lysine as a branching unit have been designed and synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis. Their complex formation with Cu(II) and Zn(II) as well as their ability to attenuate the metal-ion induced amyloid aggregation has been characterized. Both peptides can keep Cu(II) and Zn(II) in complexed forms at pH 7.4 and can bind two equivalents of metal ions in solutions with excess metal. The stoichiometry, stability and structure of the complexes formed have been determined by pH potentiometry, UV-Vis spectrophotometry, circular dichroism, EPR and NMR spectroscopy and ESI-MS. Both mono- and bimetallic species have been detected over the whole pH range studied. The basic binding mode is either a tridentate {N(amino), N(amide), N(im)} or a histamine-type of coordination which is complemented by the binding of far imidazole or amino groups leading to macrochelate formation. The peptides were able to prevent Cu(II)-induced Abeta(1-40) aggregation but could not effectively compete for Zn(II) in vitro. Our results suggest that branched peptides containing potential metal-binding sites may be suitable metal chelators for reducing the risk of amyloid plaque formation in Alzheimer's disease.

22166205|t|DNA methylation of the 5'-untranslated region at +298 and +351 represses BACE1 expression in mouse BV-2 microglial cells.
22166205|a|BACE1, which cleaves the amyloid precursor protein, is the rate-limiting enzyme for beta-amyloid peptide production, leading to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A high plasma level of homocysteine, acting as a potent methyltransferase inhibitor, is assumed to be a risk factor for AD onset. Using the demethylating drug 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza), we tested whether and how BACE1 expression is regulated in mouse BV-2 microglial cells. 5-Aza increased both BACE1 mRNA and protein levels in a dose-dependent manner. Bisulfite-sequencing analysis revealed that two CpG sites at positions +298 and +351 in the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of the BACE1 gene were specifically demethylated in BV-2 cells treated with 5-Aza. In silico analysis showed that the +351 site is the STAT3/CTCF-binding site; the function of the +298 site has not been identified. To assess whether these two CpG sites play an important role in 5-Aza-induced transcriptional activation of BACE1, we constructed a BACE1 gene promoter including the 5'-UTR (-1136 to +500) fused to a CpG-free luciferase gene (pCpGL-BACE1) and its mutant pCpGL-BACE1-AA, which has substituted CG dinucleotides at the two CpG sites of pCpGL-BACE1 to AA. Promoter analysis showed a significant decrease (~30%) in the activity of pCpGL-BACE1-AA compared with that of pCpGL-BACE1. Furthermore, in vitro methylation of these two reporter constructs showed a complete silencing of their promoter activities. Our data demonstrate that BACE1 gene expression is regulated by DNA methylation of at least two CpG sites at positions +298 and +351 in the 5'-UTR in BV-2 microglial cells.

22170742|t|Cerebral hypoperfusion accelerates cerebral amyloid angiopathy and promotes cortical microinfarcts.
22170742|a|Cortical microinfarcts (CMIs) observed in brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease tend to be located close to vessels afflicted with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). CMIs in Alzheimer's disease are preferentially distributed in the arterial borderzone, an area most vulnerable to hypoperfusion. However, the causal association between CAA and CMIs remains to be elucidated. This study consists of two parts: (1) an observational study using postmortem human brains (n = 31) to determine the association between CAA and CMIs, and (2) an experimental study to determine whether hypoperfusion worsens CAA and induces CMIs in a CAA mouse model. In postmortem human brains, the density of CMIs was 0.113/cm(2) in mild, 0.584/cm(2) in moderate, and 4.370/cm(2) in severe CAA groups with a positive linear correlation (r = 0.6736, p < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis revealed that, among seven variables (age, disease, senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, CAA, atherosclerosis and white matter damage), only the severity of CAA was a significant multivariate predictor of CMIs (p = 0.0022). Consistent with the data from human brains, CAA model mice following chronic cerebral hypoperfusion due to bilateral common carotid artery stenosis induced with 0.18-mm diameter microcoils showed accelerated deposition of leptomeningeal amyloid beta (Abeta) with a subset of them developing microinfarcts. In contrast, the CAA mice without hypoperfusion exhibited very few leptomeningeal Abeta depositions and no microinfarcts by 32 weeks of age. Following 12 weeks of hypoperfusion, cerebral blood flow decreased by 26% in CAA mice and by 15% in wild-type mice, suggesting impaired microvascular function due to perivascular Abeta accumulation after hypoperfusion. Our results suggest that cerebral hypoperfusion accelerates CAA, and thus promotes CMIs.

22170879|t|Cerebrospinal fluid markers for differential dementia diagnosis in a large memory clinic cohort.
22170879|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine how amyloid beta 42 (Abeta42), total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) levels in CSF behave in a large cohort of patients with different types of dementia. METHODS: Baseline CSF was collected from 512 patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) and 272 patients with other types of dementia (OD), 135 patients with a psychiatric disorder (PSY), and 275 patients with subjective memory complaints (SMC). Abeta42, t-tau, and p-tau (at amino acid 181) were measured in CSF by ELISA. Autopsy was obtained in a subgroup of 17 patients. RESULTS: A correct classification of patients with AD (92%) and patients with OD (66%) was accomplished when CSF Abeta42 and p-tau were combined. Patients with progressive supranuclear palsy had normal CSF biomarker values in 90%. Patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease demonstrated an extremely high CSF t-tau at a relatively normal CSF p-tau. CSF AD biomarker profile was seen in 47% of patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), 38% in corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and almost 30% in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and vascular dementia (VaD). PSY and SMC patients had normal CSF biomarkers in 91% and 88%. Older patients are more likely to have a CSF AD profile. Concordance between clinical and neuropathologic diagnosis was 85%. CSF markers reflected neuropathology in 94%. CONCLUSION: CSF Abeta42, t-tau, and p-tau are useful in differential dementia diagnosis. However, in DLB, FTLD, VaD, and CBD, a substantial group exhibit a CSF AD biomarker profile, which requires more autopsy confirmation in the future.

22171895|t|Beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 trafficking and Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.
22171895|a|beta-Site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE1) cleaves the amyloid precursor protein (APP) at the beta-secretase site to initiate the production of Abeta peptides. These accumulate to form toxic oligomers and the amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). An increase of BACE1 levels in the brain of AD patients has been mostly attributed to alterations of its intracellular trafficking. Golgi-associated adaptor proteins, GGA sort BACE1 for export to the endosomal compartment, which is the major cellular site of BACE1 activity. BACE1 undergoes recycling between endosome, trans-Golgi network (TGN), and the plasma membrane, from where it is endocytosed and either further recycled or retrieved to the endosome. Phosphorylation of Ser498 facilitates BACE1 recognition by GGA1 for retrieval to the endosome. Ubiquitination of BACE1 C-terminal Lys501 signals GGA3 for exporting BACE1 to the lysosome for degradation. In addition, the retromer mediates the retrograde transport of BACE1 from endosome to TGN. Decreased levels of GGA proteins and increased levels of retromer-associated sortilin have been associated with AD. Both would promote the co-localization of BACE1 and the amyloid precursor protein in the TGN and endosomes. Decreased levels of GGA3 also impair BACE1 degradation. Further understanding of BACE1 trafficking and its regulation may offer new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

22172527|t|Time sequence of oxidative stress in the brain from transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease related to the amyloid-beta cascade.
22172527|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial disorder characterized by the presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Rare early-onset forms of AD are associated with autosomal dominant mutations in the amyloid precursor protein gene, presenilin 1 gene, or presenilin 2 gene. The late-onset form of the disease (LOAD) is the most common form. The causes of LOAD are not yet clarified, but several environmental and genetic risk factors have been identified. Numerous studies have highlighted a role for free radical-mediated injury to brain regions of this illness. In addition, studies from mild cognitive impairment patients suggest that oxidative stress is an early event in the pathogenesis of AD. The associations between these markers of free radical damage and the pathogenic cascades involved in AD are complex. Over the past 2 decades, a number of mouse models have been created to recapitulate the major neuropathological hallmarks of AD, namely amyloid plaques and NFTs. These mice recapitulate many, although not all, of the key features of AD. Some strains of transgenic mice develop amyloid plaques, some accumulate NFTs, and some do both. Here we review the evidence for increased free radical-mediated damage to the brain with particular attention to the stage of the disease in various transgenic models of AD related to the amyloid-beta cascade.

22172925|t|Protective effect of cannabinoid CB1 receptor activation against altered intrinsic repetitive firing properties induced by Abeta neurotoxicity.
22172925|a|The amyloid beta (Abeta) protein is believed to be the key pathological mediator of Alzheimer's disease (AD) which is the first and most well known type of dementia. Despite a growing body of evidence indicating that Abeta neurotoxicity induces changes in synaptic function, little effort, if any, has been made to investigate the effect of in vivo Abeta treatment on intrinsic neuronal properties. The present study was designed to examine the effects that in vivo Abeta treatment have on the intrinsic repetitive firing properties of CA1 pyramidal neurons, using whole cell patch clamp recording. Protective effect of cannabinoid CB1 receptor activation was also investigated against Abeta-induced alterations in evoked electrophysiological activities. The findings from present study demonstrated that a bilateral injection of Abeta into the prefrontal cortex causes robust changes in activity-dependent electrophysiological responses in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. The effects of Abeta treatment alone was almost completely prevented by combined treatment with Abeta and ACEA, a selective CB1 receptor agonist. It can be concluded Abeta treatment reduces evoked neuronal activity and activation of CB1 cannabinoid receptors may have beneficial preventative effects on Abeta-induced electrophysiological changes.

22173317|t|Probucol, a lipid-lowering drug, prevents cognitive and hippocampal synaptic impairments induced by amyloid beta peptide in mice.
22173317|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by synaptic loss and cognitive impairments. The presence of extracellular senile plaques (mainly composed of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide) is an important molecular hallmark in AD and neuronal damage has been attributed, at least in part, to Abeta-mediated toxicity. Although the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of AD are not yet completely understood, several lines of evidence indicate that oxidative stress and cholesterol dyshomeostasis play crucial roles in mediating the synaptic loss and cognitive deficits observed in AD patients. This study evaluated the effects of Probucol, a phenolic lipid-lowering agent with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, on biochemical parameters related to oxidative stress and synaptic function (hippocampal glutathione and synaptophysin levels; glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and acetylcholinesterase activities; lipid peroxidation), as well as on behavioral parameters related to the cognitive function (displaced and new object recognition tasks) in Abeta-exposed mice. Animals were treated with a single intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of aggregated Abeta(1-40) (400 pmol/site) and, subsequently, received Probucol (10 mg/kg, i.p.) once a day, during the following 2 weeks. At the end of treatments, Abeta(1-40)-exposed animals showed a significant impairment on learning-memory ability, which was paralleled by a significant decrease in hippocampal synaptophysin levels, as well as by an increase in hippocampal acetylcholinesterase activity. Importantly, Probucol treatment blunted the deleterious effects of Abeta(1-40) on learning-memory ability and hippocampal biochemistry. Although Abeta(1-40) treatment did not change hippocampal glutathione levels and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities, Abeta(1-40)-exposed animals showed increased hippocampal lipid peroxidation and this event was completely blunted by Probucol treatment. These findings reinforce and extend the notion of the hazardous effects of Abeta(1-40) toward hippocampal synaptic homeostasis and cognitive functions. In addition, the present results indicate that Probucol is able to counteract the cognitive and biochemical impairments induced by i.c.v. Abeta(1-40) administration in mice. The study is the first to report the protective effects of Probucol (a "non-statin cholesterol-lowering drug") against Abeta(1-40)-induced synaptic and behavioral impairments, rendering this compound a promising molecule for further pharmacological studies on the search for therapeutic strategies to treat or prevent AD.

22173633|t|An impaired mitochondrial electron transport chain increases retention of the hypoxia imaging agent diacetylbis(4-methylthiosemicarbazonato)copperII.
22173633|a|Radiolabeled diacetylbis(4-methylthiosemicarbazonato)copper(II) [Cu(II)(atsm)] is an effective positron-emission tomography imaging agent for myocardial ischemia, hypoxic tumors, and brain disorders with regionalized oxidative stress, such as mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, and lactic acidosis with stroke-like episodes (MELAS) and Parkinson's disease. An excessively elevated reductive state is common to these conditions and has been proposed as an important mechanism affecting cellular retention of Cu from Cu(II)(atsm). However, data from whole-cell models to demonstrate this mechanism have not yet been provided. The present study used a unique cell culture model, mitochondrial xenocybrids, to provide whole-cell mechanistic data on cellular retention of Cu from Cu(II)(atsm). Genetic incompatibility between nuclear and mitochondrial encoded subunits of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) in xenocybrid cells compromises normal function of the ETC. As a consequence of this impairment to the ETC we show xenocybrid cells upregulate glycolytic ATP production and accumulate NADH. Compared to control cells the xenocybrid cells retained more Cu after being treated with Cu(II)(atsm). By transfecting the cells with a metal-responsive element reporter construct the increase in Cu retention was shown to involve a Cu(II)(atsm)-induced increase in intracellular bioavailable Cu specifically within the xenocybrid cells. Parallel experiments using cells grown under hypoxic conditions confirmed that a compromised ETC and elevated NADH levels contribute to increased cellular retention of Cu from Cu(II)(atsm). Using these cell culture models our data demonstrate that compromised ETC function, due to the absence of O(2) as the terminal electron acceptor or dysfunction of individual components of the ETC, is an important determinant in driving the intracellular dissociation of Cu(II)(atsm) that increases cellular retention of the Cu.

22177709|t|Amyloid beta peptide 1-42 disturbs intracellular calcium homeostasis through activation of GluN2B-containing N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors in cortical cultures.
22177709|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to debilitating cognitive deficits. Recent evidence demonstrates that glutamate receptors are dysregulated by amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) oligomers, resulting in disruption of glutamatergic synaptic transmission which parallels early cognitive deficits. Although it is well accepted that neuronal death in AD is related to disturbed intracellular Ca(2+) (Ca(2+)(i)) homeostasis, little is known about the contribution of NMDARs containing GluN2A or GluN2B subunits on Abeta-induced Ca(2+)(i) rise and neuronal dysfunction. Thus, the main goal of this work was to evaluate the role of NMDAR subunits in dysregulation of Ca(2+)(i) homeostasis induced by Abeta 1-42 preparation containing both oligomers (in higher percentage) and monomers in rat cerebral cortical neurons. The involvement of NMDARs was evaluated by pharmacological inhibition with MK-801 or the selective GluN2A and GLUN2B subunit antagonists NVP-AAM077 and ifenprodil, respectively. We show that Abeta, like NMDA, increase Ca(2+)(i) levels mainly through activation of NMDARs containing GluN2B subunits. Conversely, GluN2A-NMDARs antagonism potentiates Ca(2+)(i) rise induced by a high concentration of Abeta (1muM), suggesting that GluN2A and GluN2B subunits have opposite roles in regulating Ca(2+)(i) homeostasis. Moreover, Abeta modulate NMDA-induced responses and vice versa. Indeed, pre-exposure to Abeta (1muM) decrease NMDA-evoked Ca(2+)(I) rise and pre-exposure to NMDA decrease Abeta response. Interestingly, simultaneous addition of Abeta and NMDA potentiate Ca(2+)(I) levels, this effect being regulated by GluN2A and GluN2B subunits in opposite manners. This study contributes to the understanding of the molecular basis of early AD pathogenesis, by exploring the role of GluN2A and GluN2B subunits in the mechanism of Abeta toxicity in AD.

22178911|t|Development of a high-throughput screen targeting caspase-8-mediated cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein.
22178911|a|Caspases, effectors of apoptosis, are key mediators of neuronal death in several neurodegenerative diseases. Caspase-8 and caspase-6 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease (AD). ss-Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is cleaved at Asp664 in its intracellular domain by caspase-8. We and other laboratories recently showed that obliteration of the caspase cleavage site on APP alleviates functional AD-like deficits in a mouse model. Therefore, caspase cleavage of APP constitutes a potential novel target for therapeutic intervention. To identify chemical inhibitors of caspase-8 cleavage, we screened a subset of the chemical library at the Harvard NeuroDiscovery Center's Laboratory for Drug Discovery in Neurodegeneration. We show that caspase-8, but not caspase-1, -3, or -9, cleaves a biotinylated peptide derived from APP at Asp664, and we report the development of a sensitive high-throughput assay for caspase-8 cleavage of APP and the use of that assay for the identification of specific small molecule "hit" compounds that potently inhibit Asp664 cleavage of APP. Furthermore, we demonstrate that one of these compounds (LDN-0021835) inhibits the cleavage of APP at Asp664 in cell-based assays.

22178929|t|Ginsenoside Rg1 promotes nonamyloidgenic cleavage of APP via estrogen receptor signaling to MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt.
22178929|a|BACKGROUND: The pathogenic accumulation of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta), a natural occurring peptide processed from beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP), is considered to play a key role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Ginsenoside Rg1, an active component in ginseng, has been identified as a phytoestrogen and also found to be neuroprotective. However, it is unknown whether Rg1-induced estrogenic activity intervenes in APP processing, and improves memory performance. METHODS: Using HT22 cells and SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing the Swedish mutant APP (APPsw), this study investigated whether Rg1 intervened in APP metabolism through estrogenic activity. Using the ovariectomized (OVX) rats to mimic age-related changes in postmenopausal females, this study also tested the long-term effect of Rg1 on APP metabolism. RESULTS: The in vitro study demonstrated that Rg1 increased extracellular secretion of soluble amyloid precursor protein alpha (sAPPalpha), enhanced alpha-secretase activity and decreased extracellular release of Abeta. These effects of Rg1 could be prevented by inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC), Extracellular-Signal Regulated Kinase/Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (ERK/MAPK) and Phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways. Inhibition of endogenous estrogen receptor (ER) activity abrogated Rg1-triggered release of sAPPalpha, increase of alpha-secretase activity, and activation of ERK and Akt signaling. In addition, Rg1 promoted phosphorylation of ERalpha at Ser118 residue. The in vivo study demonstrated that 8-week Rg1 treatment of OVX rats increased sAPPalpha levels and decreased Abeta content in the hippocampi, and improved the spatial learning and memory. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Rg1 might be used to slow or prevent AD, in particular in postmenopausal females.

22179528|t|The role of APP proteolytic processing in lipid metabolism.
22179528|a|Amyloid plaques in brains are one of the major pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). These plaques are mainly formed by aggregated Abeta, generated by proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Therefore, APP processing and Abeta production have been one of the central scopes in AD research in the past. Now, accumulating evidence suggests that besides its pathological impact, APP and its cleavage products also contribute to physiological functions. Proteolytic cleavage of APP is tightly regulated, and several lipids such as cholesterol and sphingolipids have been shown to influence APP processing and Abeta generation. In turn, Abeta as well as other APP cleavage products plays an essential role in regulating lipid homeostasis arguing for complex regulatory cycles in which lipids control APP processing and vice versa. This balanced regulation is disrupted under pathological conditions such as in AD. This article will review the physiological function of APP and its proteolytic products, especially Abeta and AICD, in regulating lipid homeostasis and which lipid species modulate APP processing. Furthermore, we summarize the alterations in lipid metabolism observed in AD patients and AD mouse models.

22182491|t|Differing modes of interaction between monomeric Abeta(1-40) peptides and model lipid membranes: an AFM study.
22182491|a|Membrane interactions with beta-amyloid peptides are implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease and cholesterol has been shown to be key modulator of this interaction, yet little is known about the mechanism of this interaction. Using atomic force microscopy, we investigated the interaction of monomeric Abeta(1-40) peptides with planar mica-supported bilayers composed of DOPC and DPPC containing varying concentrations of cholesterol. We show that below the bilayer melting temperature, Abeta monomers adsorb to, and assemble on, the surface of DPPC bilayers to form layers that grow laterally and normal to the bilayer plane. Above the bilayer melting temperature, we observe protofibril formation. In contrast, in DOPC bilayers, Abeta monomers exhibit a detergent-like action, forming defects in the bilayer structure. The kinetics of both modes of interaction significantly increases with increasing membrane cholesterol content. We conclude that the mode and rate of the interaction of Abeta monomers with lipid bilayers are strongly dependent on lipid composition, phase state and cholesterol content.

22182692|t|Targeting hyperphosphorylated tau with sodium selenate suppresses seizures in rodent models.
22182692|a|Tau hyperphosphorylation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of forms of human epilepsy. Here we investigated whether treatment with sodium selenate, a drug which reduces pathological hyperphosphorylated tau by enhancement of PP2A activity, would inhibit seizures in rodent models. In vitro, sodium selenate reduced tau phosphorylation in human neuroblastoma cells and reversed the increase in tau phosphorylation induced by the PP2A inhibitor, okadaic acid. Sodium selenate treatment was then tested against three different rodent seizure models. Firstly the propensity of 6-Hz electrical corneal stimulation to induce seizures in adult mice was assessed following acute treatment with different doses of sodium selenate. Secondly, the number of seizures induced by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) was quantified in rats following chronic sodium selenate treatment via drinking water. Finally, amygdala kindled rats were chronically treated with sodium selenate in drinking water and the length and the severity of the seizures evoked by stimulation of the amygdala recorded. The results demonstrated a dose-dependent protection of sodium selenate against 6-Hz stimulation induced seizures, and significant reduction in the total number of seizures following PTZ injection. Amygdala kindled rats chronically treated with sodium selenate had significantly shorter seizure duration compared controls, with more pronounced effects observed as the duration of treatment increased. The results of this study indicate that targeting hyperphosphorylated tau by treatment with sodium selenate has anti-seizure effects in a broad range of rodent models, and may represent a novel approach to treatment of patients with epilepsy.

22182960|t|Amyloid precursor protein binding protein-1 knockdown reduces neuronal differentiation in fetal neural stem cells.
22182960|a|Amyloid precursor protein binding protein-1 (APP-BP1) was first identified as an interacting protein of APP. In this study, we explored whether APP-BP1 plays a role in neuronal differentiation of fetal neural stem cells. APP-BP1 knockdown by small interfering RNA treatment was found to downregulate neuronal differentiation and to upregulate APP intracellular domain production from APP in fetal neural stem cells. Furthermore, the change in gene expression profiles was systemically examined by DNA microarray. The expression of several genes including ephrin A2 was upregulated by APP-BP1 knockdown as assessed with DNA microarray and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Taken together, our results suggest that APP-BP1 modulates neuronal differentiation by altering gene expression profiles in fetal neural stem cells.

22184106|t|Prolyl isomerase Pin1 promotes amyloid precursor protein (APP) turnover by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) activity: novel mechanism for Pin1 to protect against Alzheimer disease.
22184106|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of senile plaques of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP) and neurofibrillary tangles made of hyperphosphorylated Tau. Increasing APP gene dosage or expression has been shown to cause familial early-onset AD. However, whether and how protein stability of APP is regulated is unclear. The prolyl isomerase Pin1 and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) have been shown to have the opposite effects on APP processing and Tau hyperphosphorylation, relevant to the pathogenesis of AD. However, nothing is known about their relationship. In this study, we found that Pin1 binds to the pT330-P motif in GSK3beta to inhibit its kinase activity. Furthermore, Pin1 promotes protein turnover of APP by inhibiting GSK3beta activity. A point mutation either at Thr-330, the Pin1-binding site in GSK3beta, or at Thr-668, the GSK3beta phosphorylation site in APP, abolished the regulation of GSK3beta activity, Thr-668 phosphorylation, and APP stability by Pin1, resulting in reduced non-amyloidogenic APP processing and increased APP levels. These results uncover a novel role of Pin1 in inhibiting GSK3beta kinase activity to reduce APP protein levels, providing a previously unrecognized mechanism by which Pin1 protects against Alzheimer disease.

22184125|t|alpha-Secretase-derived fragment of cellular prion, N1, protects against monomeric and oligomeric amyloid beta (Abeta)-associated cell death.
22184125|a|In physiological conditions, both beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP) and cellular prion (PrP(c)) undergo similar disintegrin-mediated alpha-secretase cleavage yielding N-terminal secreted products referred to as soluble amyloid precursor protein-alpha (sAPPalpha) and N1, respectively. We recently demonstrated that N1 displays neuroprotective properties by reducing p53-dependent cell death both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we examined the potential of N1 as a neuroprotector against amyloid beta (Abeta)-mediated toxicity. We first show that both recombinant sAPPalpha and N1, but not its inactive parent fragment N2, reduce staurosporine-stimulated caspase-3 activation and TUNEL-positive cell death by lowering p53 promoter transactivation and activity in human cells. We demonstrate that N1 also lowers toxicity, cell death, and p53 pathway exacerbation triggered by Swedish mutated betaAPP overexpression in human cells. We designed a CHO cell line overexpressing the London mutated betaAPP (APP(LDN)) that yields Abeta oligomers. N1 protected primary cultured neurons against toxicity and cell death triggered by oligomer-enriched APP(LDN)-derived conditioned medium. Finally, we establish that N1 also protects neurons against oligomers extracted from Alzheimer disease-affected brain tissues. Overall, our data indicate that a cellular prion catabolite could interfere with Abeta-associated toxicity and that its production could be seen as a cellular protective mechanism aimed at compensating for an sAPPalpha deficit taking place at the early asymptomatic phase of Alzheimer disease.

22185619|t|Huprine-tacrine heterodimers as anti-amyloidogenic compounds of potential interest against Alzheimer's and prion diseases.
22185619|a|A family of huprine-tacrine heterodimers has been developed to simultaneously block the active and peripheral sites of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Their dual site binding for AChE, supported by kinetic and molecular modeling studies, results in a highly potent inhibition of the catalytic activity of human AChE and, more importantly, in the in vitro neutralization of the pathological chaperoning effect of AChE toward the aggregation of both the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) and a prion peptide with a key role in the aggregation of the prion protein. Huprine-tacrine heterodimers take on added value in that they display a potent in vitro inhibitory activity toward human butyrylcholinesterase, self-induced Abeta aggregation, and beta-secretase. Finally, they are able to cross the blood-brain barrier, as predicted in an artificial membrane model assay and demonstrated in ex vivo experiments with OF1 mice, reaching their multiple biological targets in the central nervous system. Overall, these compounds are promising lead compounds for the treatment of Alzheimer's and prion diseases.

22188425|t|Amyloid generation and dysfunctional immunoproteasome activation with disease progression in animal model of familial Alzheimer's disease.
22188425|a|Double-transgenic amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) mice express a chimeric mouse/human APP bearing the Swedish mutation (Mo/HuAPP695swe) and a mutant human PS1-dE9 both causative of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). Transgenic mice show impaired memory and learning performance from the age of 6 months onwards. Double-transgenic APP/PS1 mice express altered APP and PS1 mRNAs and proteins, reduced beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) mRNA and normal BACE1 protein, all of which suggest a particular mechanism of amyloidogenesis when compared with sporadic AD. The first beta-amyloid plaques in APP/PS1 mice appear at 3 months, and they increase in number and distribution with disease progression in parallel with increased levels of brain soluble beta-amyloid 1-42 and 1-40, but also with reduced 1-42/1-40 ratio with age. Amyloid deposition in plaques is accompanied by altered mitochondria and increased oxidative damage, post-translational modifications and accumulation of altered proteins at the dystrophic neurites surrounding plaques. Degradation pathways are also modified with disease progression including activation of the immunoproteasome together with variable alterations of the different protease activities of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Present observations show modifications in the production of beta-amyloid and activation and malfunction of the subcellular degradation pathways that have general implications in the pathogenesis of AD and more particularly in specificities of FAD amyloidogenesis.

22188721|t|Critical role of cPLA2 in Abeta oligomer-induced neurodegeneration and memory deficit.
22188721|a|Soluble beta-amyloid (Abeta) oligomers are considered to putatively play a critical role in the early synapse loss and cognitive impairment observed in Alzheimer's disease. We previously demonstrated that Abeta oligomers activate cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)), which specifically releases arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids. We here observed that cPLA(2) gene inactivation prevented the alterations of cognitive abilities and the reduction of hippocampal synaptic markers levels noticed upon a single intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta oligomers in wild type mice. We further demonstrated that the Abeta oligomer-induced sphingomyelinase activation was suppressed and that phosphorylation of Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) was preserved in neuronal cells isolated from cPLA(2)(-/-) mice. Interestingly, expression of the Abeta precursor protein (APP) was reduced in hippocampus homogenates and neuronal cells from cPLA(2)(-/-) mice, but the relationship with the resistance of these mice to the Abeta oligomer toxicity requires further investigation. These results therefore show that cPLA(2) plays a key role in the Abeta oligomer-associated neurodegeneration, and as such represents a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

22189452|t|APOE modifies the association between Abeta load and cognition in cognitively normal older adults.
22189452|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between beta-amyloid (Abeta) load as measured by [(11)C]-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET and cognitive function in cognitively normal older adults. METHODS: We studied 408 cognitively normal older adults who participated in the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) from January 2009 through March 2011. The participants underwent PiB PET and neuropsychometric testing within 6 months. The association between PiB retention and cognitive function was measured by partial correlation and an interaction with APOE status was tested using linear regression after adjusting for age, sex, and education. RESULTS: Higher PiB retention was associated with cognitive performance (Spearman partial r = -0.18; p < 0.01), specifically the memory, language, attention/executive, and visual-spatial processing domains in the whole group of participants. The association between PiB retention and cognition was modified by the APOE status on linear regression analysis even after controlling for the differences in the distribution of PiB values among APOE epsilon4 carriers and noncarriers (p = 0.02). Cognitive performance was associated with the Abeta deposition in the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobe association cortices in APOE epsilon4 carriers on SPM analysis (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: There is a modest association between PiB retention and cognitive function in cognitively normal older adults and this relationship between Abeta load and cognitive function is modified by APOE status. Whereas Abeta load is associated with greater cognitive impairment in APOE epsilon4 carriers, the cognitive function in APOE epsilon4 noncarriers is influenced less by the Abeta load, suggesting that APOE isoforms modulate the harmful effects of Abeta on cognitive function.

22189983|t|Reevaluation of copper(I) affinity for amyloid-beta peptides by competition with ferrozine--an unusual copper(I) indicator.
22189983|a|The association constant of ferrozine (5,6-diphenyl-3-(2-pyridyl)-1,2,4-triazine-4,4''-disulfonic acid) with Cu(I) to form the chromophoric [Cu(I)(Fz)(2)](3-) complex was determined by UV/Vis titration experiments in Hepes buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4). An association constant close to 10(12) M(-2), which is significantly weaker than those of the well-known, water-soluble, Cu(I) chelators bicinchoninic acid and 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenantroline disulfonic acid, was found. The [Cu(I)(Fz)(2)](3-) chromophore was used in UV/Vis competition experiments to determine Cu(I) binding affinity for the amyloid-beta peptide involved in Alzheimer's disease and for a series of pertinent mutants. An association constant of approximately 10(7) M(-1) was found; this is much weaker than that reported for dithiothreitol and confirms that imidazoles are harder ligands than thiolates. Each His mutation (H6A, H13A, and H14A) impacts the peptide affinity for Cu(I). The native human amyloid-beta peptide was found to be a fourfold-stronger Cu(I) ligand than the murine peptide, which differs by three point mutations (R5G, Y10F, and H13R) from the human one.

22192143|t|Enhanced neuronal plasticity and elevated endogenous sAPPalpha levels in mice over-expressing MMP9.
22192143|a|Evidence accumulating during the past few years points to a significant role of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) enzymatic activity in synaptic plasticity and cognitive processes. We have previously demonstrated that MMP9 is involved in receptor-mediated alpha-secretase-like cleavage of APP in vitro, resulting in increased secretion of sAPPalpha, the soluble N-terminal product of the non-amyloidogenic pathway known to be involved in neuronal plasticity and memory formation. To study the in vivo role of MMP9, we have generated transgenic mice over-expressing MMP9 in the brain. Herein, we demonstrate that MMP9 transgenic animals display enhanced performance in the non-spatial novel object recognition and the spatial water-maze task and that their enhanced performance was accompanied by increased dendritic spine density in the hippocampus and cortex following behavioural testing. Consistent with the above observations, the electrophysiological analysis revealed prolonged maintenance of long-term synaptic potentiation in hippocampal slices from MMP9 transgenic mice. Moreover, elevated sAPPalpha levels in the hippocampus and cortex of MPP9 transgenic animals were also observed. Overall, our results extend previous findings on the physiological role of MMP9 in neuronal plasticity and furthermore reveal that, APP may be one of the physiological proteolytic targets of MMP9 in vivo.

22193043|t|Further evidence for amyloid deposition in clinical pancreatic islet grafts.
22193043|a|BACKGROUND: The reasons for the long-term complete or partial loss of islet graft function are unknown, but there are obviously other reasons than just pure allogeneic graft rejection. Earlier studies have shown that deposition of islet amyloid polypeptide amyloid in transplanted islets may indicate a mechanism for loss of beta cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sections from liver material from four deceased islet-bearing recipients have been scrutinized for the presence of amyloid. Clinical data and certain aspects of the islet graft pathology of these patients have been published previously. RESULT: With this extended histological analysis, we demonstrate the occurrence of amyloid deposits in islets transplanted into the liver in three of four patients with type 1 diabetes. CONCLUSION: The finding adds evidence to the assumption that aggregation of islet amyloid polypeptide might be an important cause of progressing beta-cell dysfunction in clinically transplanted islets.

22193058|t|Enhancement of nose-to-brain delivery of basic fibroblast growth factor for improving rat memory impairments induced by co-injection of beta-amyloid and ibotenic acid into the bilateral hippocampus.
22193058|a|Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) delivery to the brain of animals appears to be an emerging potential therapeutic approach to neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The intranasal route of administration could provide an alternative to intracerebroventricular infusion. A nasal spray of bFGF had been developed previously and the objective of the present study was to investigate whether bFGF nasal spray could enhance brain uptake of bFGF and ameliorate memory impairment induced by co-injection of beta-amyloid(25-35) and ibotenic acid into bilateral hippocampus of rats. The results of brain uptake study showed that the AUC(0-12h) of bFGF nasal spray in olfactory bulb, cerebrum, cerebellum and hippocampus was respectively 2.47, 2.38, 2.56 and 2.19 times that of intravenous bFGF solution, and 1.11, 1.95, 1.40 and 1.93 times that of intranasal bFGF solution, indicating that intranasal administration of bFGF nasal spray was an effective means of delivering bFGF to the brain, especially to cerebrum and hippocampus. In Morris water maze tasks, intravenous administration of bFGF solution at high dose (40 mug/kg) showed little improvement on spatial memory impairment. In contrast, bFGF solution of the same dose following intranasal administration could significantly ameliorate spatial memory impairment. bFGF nasal spray obviously improved spatial memory impairment even at a dose half (20 mug/kg) of bFGF solution, recovered their acetylcholinesterase and choline acetyltransferase activity to the sham control level, and alleviated neuronal degeneration in rat hippocampus, indicating neuroprotective effects on the central nerve system. In a word, bFGF nasal spray may be a new formulation of great potential for treating AD.

22197104|t|Environmental enrichment ameliorated high-fat diet-induced Abeta deposition and memory deficit in APP transgenic mice.
22197104|a|The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is tightly associated with metabolic dysfunctions. In particular, a potential link between type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and AD has been suggested epidemiologically, clinically, and experimentally, and some studies have suggested that exercise or dietary intervention reduces risk of cognitive decline. However, there is little solid molecular evidence for the effective intervention of metabolic dysfunctions for prevention of AD. In the present study, we established the AD model mice with diabetic conditions through high-fat diet (HFD) to examine the effect of environmental enrichment (EE) on HFD-induced AD pathophysiology. Here, we demonstrated that HFD markedly deteriorated memory impairment and increased beta-amyloid (Abeta) oligomers as well as Abeta deposition in amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice, which was reversed by exposure to an enriched environment for 10 weeks, despite the continuation of HFD. These studies provide solid evidence that EE is a useful intervention to ameliorate behavioral changes and AD pathology in HFD-induced aggravation of AD symptoms in APP transgenic mice.

22197298|t|Cognitive phenotyping of amyloid precursor protein transgenic J20 mice.
22197298|a|Transgenic mice that express familial Alzheimer's disease mutant forms of the human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) have proved to be invaluable in determining the impact that the neurotoxic amyloid-beta peptide has in vivo. In addition to the propensity to accumulate cerebral amyloid plaques, a crucial characteristic of hAPP mouse models is their cognitive impairments. To date the most widely used test for analyzing cognitive impairment in hAPP mice is the Morris water maze (MWM) which, due to the fact that mice are not "natural" swimmers, may not always be the ideal paradigm to investigate cognitive behaviours. Furthermore, not all cognitive impairments have been replicated across research laboratories. In the current study, we characterised the cognitive abilities of the J20 transgenic mouse line (expressing the Swedish 670/671(KM->NL) and Indiana (717(V->F)hAPP mutations) and non-transgenic mice. Mice were assessed in the cheeseboard task (i.e., a 'dry version' of the MWM) and a variety of other cognitive paradigms to test fear conditioning, object recognition and short-term memory to broaden the understanding of the cognitive deficits in J20 mice. hAPP transgenic mice perform normally in tasks for fear conditioning, short-term object recognition and short-term memory of context familiarity. However, they were profoundly impaired in their spatial reference memory capabilities in the cheeseboard task. The cheeseboard task has potential to replace the MWM task in situations where the MWM is not suitable for particular mouse models.

22197375|t|Structural basis of C-terminal beta-amyloid peptide binding by the antibody ponezumab for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
22197375|a|Alzheimer's disease, the most common cause of dementia in the elderly and characterized by the deposition and accumulation of plaques, is composed in part of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides, loss of neurons, and the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles. Here, we describe ponezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, and show how it binds specifically to the carboxyl (C)-terminus of Abeta40. Ponezumab can label Abeta that is deposited in brain parenchyma found in sections from Alzheimer's disease casualties and in transgenic mouse models that overexpress Abeta. Importantly, ponezumab does not label full-length, non-cleaved amyloid precursor protein on the cell surface. The C-terminal epitope of the soluble Abeta present in the circulation appears to be available for ponezumab binding because systemic administration of ponezumab greatly elevates plasma Abeta40 levels in a dose-dependent fashion after administration to a mouse model that overexpress human Abeta. Administration of ponezumab to transgenic mice also led to a dose-dependent reduction in hippocampal amyloid load. To further explore the nature of ponezumab binding to Abeta40, we determined the X-ray crystal structure of ponezumab in complex with Abeta40 and found that the Abeta40 carboxyl moiety makes extensive contacts with ponezumab. Furthermore, the structure-function analysis supported this critical requirement for carboxy group of AbetaV40 in the Abeta-ponezumab interaction. These findings provide novel structural insights into the in vivo conformation of the C-terminus of Abeta40 and the brain Abeta-lowering efficacy that we observed following administration of ponezumab in transgenic mouse models.

22198657|t|Trans fatty acids enhanced beta-amyloid induced oxidative stress in nerve growth factor differentiated PC12 cells.
22198657|a|The effects of trans fatty acids, elaidic acid (trans-9, C18:1) and linoelaidic acid (trans-9, trans-12 C18:2), at 20 or 40 muM in nerve growth factor differentiated PC12 cells with or without beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) were examined. Elaidic acid treatment alone did not affect cell viability and oxidative injury associated markers (P > 0.05). However, co-treatments of elaidic acid and Abeta led to more reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and Na+-K+-ATPase activity, and more increase in DNA fragmentation and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) production than Abeta treatment alone (P < 0.05). Linoelaidic acid alone exhibited apoptotic and oxidative effects in cells via decreasing MMP and Na+-K+-ATPase activity, increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, lowering glutathione content and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity (P < 0.05). The co-treatments of linoelaidic acid with Abeta further enhanced oxidative damage via enhancing the generation of ROS, nitrite oxide and 8-OHdG, elevating caspase-3, caspase-8 and nitric oxide synthase activities, as well as declining GPX, catalase and superoxide dismutase activities (P < 0.05). These results suggested that the interaction of linoelaidic acid and Abeta promoted oxidative stress and impaired mitochondrial functions in neuronal cells.

22198949|t|TLR2 is a primary receptor for Alzheimer's amyloid beta peptide to trigger neuroinflammatory activation.
22198949|a|Microglia activated by extracellularly deposited amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) act as a two-edged sword in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis: on the one hand, they damage neurons by releasing neurotoxic proinflammatory mediators (M1 activation); on the other hand, they protect neurons by triggering anti-inflammatory/neurotrophic M2 activation and by clearing Abeta via phagocytosis. TLRs are associated with Abeta-induced microglial inflammatory activation and Abeta internalization, but the mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we used real-time surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and conventional biochemical pull-down assays to demonstrate a direct interaction between TLR2 and the aggregated 42-aa form of human Abeta (Abeta42). TLR2 deficiency reduced Abeta42-triggered inflammatory activation but enhanced Abeta phagocytosis in cultured microglia and macrophages. By expressing TLR2 in HEK293 cells that do not endogenously express TLR2, we observed that TLR2 expression enabled HEK293 cells to respond to Abeta42. Through site-directed mutagenesis of tlr2 gene, we identified the amino acids EKKA (741-744) as a critical cytoplasmic domain for transduction of inflammatory signals. By coexpressing TLR1 or TLR6 in TLR2-transgenic HEK293 cells or silencing tlrs genes in RAW264.7 macrophages, we observed that TLR2-mediated Abeta42-triggered inflammatory activation was enhanced by TLR1 and suppressed by TLR6. Using bone marrow chimeric Alzheimer's amyloid precursor transgenic mice, we observed that TLR2 deficiency in microglia shifts M1- to M2-inflammatory activation in vivo, which was associated with improved neuronal function. Our study demonstrated that TLR2 is a primary receptor for Abeta to trigger neuroinflammatory activation and suggested that inhibition of TLR2 in microglia could be beneficial in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.

22200570|t|Effect of N-homocysteinylation on physicochemical and cytotoxic properties of amyloid beta-peptide.
22200570|a|Abstract Hyperhomocysteinemia has recently been identified as an important risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). One of the potential mechanisms underlying harmful effects of homocysteine (Hcy) is site-specific acylation of proteins at lysine residues by homocysteine thiolactone (HCTL). The accumulation of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) in the brain is a neuropathological hallmark of AD. In the present study we were interested to investigate the effects of N-homocysteinylation on the aggregation propensity and neurotoxicity of Abeta(1-42). By coupling several techniques, we demonstrated that the homocysteinylation of lysine residues increase the neurotoxicity of the Abeta peptide by stabilizing soluble oligomeric intermediates.

22200927|t|A new methodology for simultaneous quantification of total-Abeta, Abetax-38, Abetax-40, and Abetax-42 by column-switching LC/MS/MS.
22200927|a|This article details the development of a novel method that overcomes the drawbacks of sandwich ELISA (sELISA) and allows reliable evaluation of simultaneous quantification of the amyloid (Abeta)-peptides, total-Abeta, Abetax-38, Abetax-40, and Abetax-42, in rat brain by optimized sample purification and column-switching liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). This method provides accurate analyses of total-Abeta, Abetax-38, Abetax-40, and Abetax-42 with a linear calibration range between 0.05 and 45 ng/mL. Verification for accuracy and precision of biological samples were determined by a standard addition and recovery test, spiked with synthetic Abeta1-38, Abeta1-40, and Abeta1-42 into the rat brain homogenate. This method showed <20% relative error and relative standard deviation, indicating high reproducibility and reliability. The brain concentrations of total-Abeta, Abetax-38, Abetax-40, and Abetax-42 after oral administration of flurbiprofen in rats were measured by this method. Abetax-42 concentrations (4.57 +- 0.69 ng/g) in rats administered flurbiprofen were lower than those in untreated rats (6.48 +- 0.93 ng/g). This was consistent with several reports demonstrating that NSAIDs reduced the generation of Abeta. We report here a method that allows not only the quantification of specific molecular species of Abeta but also simultaneous quantification of total-Abeta, Abetax-38, Abetax-40, and Abetax-42, thus overcoming the drawbacks of sELISA.

22202667|t|Promotion of beta-amyloid production by C-reactive protein and its implications in the early pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
22202667|a|C-reactive protein (CRP) and beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) are involved in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the relationship between CRP and Abeta production is unclear. In vitro and in vivo experiments were performed to investigate the association of CRP with Abeta production. Using the rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cell line (PC12 cells) to mimic neurons, cytotoxicity was evaluated by cell viability and supernatant lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity. The levels of amyloid precursor protein (APP), beta-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE-1), and presenilins (PS-1 and PS-2) were investigated using real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting analysis. Abeta1-42 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The relevance of CRP and Abeta as well as potential mechanisms were studied using APP/PS1 transgenic (Tg) mice. Treatment with 0.5-4.0 muM CRP for 48 h decreased cell viability and increased LDH leakage in PC12 cells. Incubation with CRP at a sub-toxic concentration of 0.2 muM increased the mRNA levels of APP, BACE-1, PS-1, and PS-2, as well as Abeta1-42 production. CRP inhibitor reversed the CRP-induced upregulations of the mRNA levels of APP, BACE-1, PS-1, and PS-2, and the protein levels of APP, BACE-1, PS-1, and Abeta1-42, but did not reversed Abeta1-42 cytotoxicity. The cerebral levels of CRP and Abeta1-42 in APP/PS1 Tg mice were positively correlated, accompanied with the elevated mRNA expressions of serum amyloid P component (SAP), complement component 1q (C1q), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). These results suggest that CRP cytotoxicity is associated with Abeta formation and Abeta-related markers expressions; CRP and Abeta were relevant in early-stage AD; CRP may be an important trigger in AD pathogenesis.

22204905|t|Fibrillar amyloid-beta1-42 modifies actin organization affecting the cofilin phosphorylation state: a role for Rac1/cdc42 effector proteins and the slingshot phosphatase.
22204905|a|The neuronal cytoskeleton regulates numerous processes that occur in normal homeostasis. Under pathological conditions such as those of Alzheimer's disease (AD), major alterations in cytoskeleton organization have been observed and changes in both microtubules and actin filaments have been reported. Many neurodegenerative consequences of AD are linked to the production and accumulation of amyloid peptides (Abeta) and their oligomers, produced from the internal cleavage of the amyloid-beta protein precursor. We previously reported that fibrillar Abeta1-42 (fAbeta) treatment of hippocampal neurons induced an increase in Rac1 and Cdc42 activities linking fAbeta effects with changes in actin dynamics. Here we show fAbeta-induces increased activity of PAK1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 5, and that p21-activated kinase (PAK1) activation targets the LIMK1-cofilin signaling pathway. Increased cofilin dephosphorylation under conditions of enhanced LIM-Kinase 1 (LIMK1) activity suggests that fAbeta co-stimulates bifurcating pathways impacting cofilin phosphorylation. Overexpression of slingshot (SSH) prevents the augment of F-actin induced by fAbeta after 24 h, suggesting that fAbeta-induced changes in actin assembly involve both LIMK1 and SSH. These results suggest that fAb may alter the PAK1/LIMK1/cofilin axis and therefore actin organization in AD.

22206488|t|Phosphorus dendrimers affect Alzheimer's (Abeta1-28) peptide and MAP-Tau protein aggregation.
22206488|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by pathological aggregation of beta-amyloid peptides and MAP-Tau protein. beta-Amyloid (Abeta) is a peptide responsible for extracellular Alzheimer's plaque formation. Intracellular MAP-Tau aggregates appear as a result of hyperphosphorylation of this cytoskeletal protein. Small, oligomeric forms of Abeta are intermediate products that appear before the amyloid plaques are formed. These forms are believed to be most neurotoxic. Dendrimers are highly branched polymers, which may find an application in regulation of amyloid fibril formation. Several biophysical and biochemical methods, like circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence intensity of thioflavin T and thioflavin S, transmission electron microscopy, spectrofluorimetry (measuring quenching of intrinsic peptide fluorescence) and MTT-cytotoxicity assay, were applied to characterize interactions of cationic phosphorus-containing dendrimers of generation 3 and generation 4 (CPDG3, CPDG4) with the fragment of amyloid peptide (Abeta(1-28)) and MAP-Tau protein. We have demonstrated that CPDs are able to affect beta-amyloid and MAP-Tau aggregation processes. A neuro-2a cell line (N2a) was used to test cytotoxicity of formed fibrils and intermediate products during the Abeta(1-28) aggregation. It has been shown that CPDs might have a beneficial effect by reducing the system toxicity. Presented results suggest that phosphorus dendrimers may be used in the future as agents regulating the fibrilization processes in Alzheimer's disease.

22206845|t|A new neuronal target for beta-amyloid peptide in the rat hippocampus.
22206845|a|In Alzheimer's disease, amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) accumulation is associated with hippocampal network dysfunction. Intrahippocampal injections of Abeta induce aberrant inhibitory septohippocampal (SH) network activity in vivo and impairment of memory processing. In the present study, we observed, after hippocampal Abeta treatment, a selective loss of neurons projecting to the medial septum (MS) and containing calbindin (CB) and/or somatostatin (SOM). Other GABAergic neuronal subpopulations were not altered. Thus, the present study identifies hippocamposeptal neuron populations as specific targets for Abeta deposits. We observed that in Abeta-treated rats but not in controls, glutamate agonist application induced rhythmic bursting in 55% of the slow-firing neurons in the medial septum. This suggests that hippocampal Abeta can trigger modifications of the septohippocampal pathway via the alteration of a specific neuronal population. Long-range hippocamposeptal GABA/calbindin neurons, targets of hippocampal amyloid deposits, are implicated in supporting network synchronization. By identifying this target, we contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying deleterious effects of Abeta, one of the main agents of dementia in Alzheimer's disease.

22206846|t|Calpastatin modulates APP processing in the brains of beta-amyloid depositing but not wild-type mice.
22206846|a|We report that neuronal overexpression of the endogenous inhibitor of calpains, calpastatin (CAST), in a mouse model of human Alzheimer's disease (AD) beta-amyloidosis, the APP23 mouse, reduces beta-amyloid (Abeta) pathology and Abeta levels when comparing aged, double transgenic (tg) APP23/CAST with APP23 mice. Concurrent with Abeta plaque deposition, aged APP23/CAST mice show a decrease in the steady-state brain levels of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and APP C-terminal fragments (CTFs) when compared with APP23 mice. This CAST-dependent decrease in APP metabolite levels was not observed in single tg CAST mice expressing endogenous APP or in younger, Abeta plaque predepositing APP23/CAST mice. We also determined that the CAST-mediated inhibition of calpain activity in the brain is greater in the CAST mice with Abeta pathology than in non-APP tg mice, as demonstrated by a decrease in calpain-mediated cytoskeleton protein cleavage. Moreover, aged APP23/CAST mice have reduced extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activity and tau phosphorylation when compared with APP23 mice. In summary, in vivo calpain inhibition mediated by CAST transgene expression reduces Abeta pathology in APP23 mice, with our findings further suggesting that APP metabolism is modified by CAST overexpression as the mice develop Abeta pathology. Our results indicate that the calpain system in neurons is more responsive to CAST inhibition under conditions of Abeta pathology, suggesting that in the disease state neurons may be more sensitive to the therapeutic use of calpain inhibitors.

22206987|t|Sensitivity of amyloid formation by human islet amyloid polypeptide to mutations at residue 20.
22206987|a|Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP, amylin) is responsible for amyloid formation in type 2 diabetes and in islet cell transplants. The only known natural mutation found in mature human IAPP is a Ser20-to-Gly missense mutation, found with small frequency in Chinese and Japanese populations. The mutation appears to be associated with increased risk of early-onset type 2 diabetes. Early measurements in the presence of organic co-solvents showed that S20G-IAPP formed amyloid more quickly than the wild type. We confirm that the mutant accelerates amyloid formation under a range of conditions including in the absence of co-solvents. Ser20 adopts a normal backbone geometry, and the side chain makes no steric clashes in models of IAPP amyloid fibers, suggesting that the increased rate of amyloid formation by the mutant does not result from the relief of steric incompatibility in the fiber state. Transmission electronic microscopy, circular dichroism, and seeding studies were used to probe the structure of the resulting fibers. The S20G-IAPP peptide is toxic to cultured rat INS-1 (transformed rat insulinoma-1) beta-cells. The sensitivity of amyloid formation to the identity of residue 20 was exploited to design a variant that is much slower to aggregate and that inhibits amyloid formation by wild-type IAPP. An S20K mutant forms amyloid with an 18-fold longer lag phase in homogeneous solution. Thioflavin T binding assays, together with experiments using a p-cyanophenylalanine (p-cyanoPhe) variant of human IAPP, show that the designed S20K mutant inhibits amyloid formation by human IAPP. The experiments illustrate how p-cyanoPhe can be exploited to monitor amyloid formation even in the presence of other amyloidogenic proteins.

22207005|t|Genomic and nongenomic signaling induced by 1alpha,25(OH)2-vitamin D3 promotes the recovery of amyloid-beta phagocytosis by Alzheimer's disease macrophages.
22207005|a|Brain clearance of amyloid-beta (Abeta42) by innate immune cells is necessary for maintenance of normal brain function. Phagocytosis of soluble Abeta42 by Alzheimer's disease (AD) macrophages is defective, recovered in all "Type I and Type II" AD patients by 1alpha,25(OH)2-vitamin D3 (1,25D3) and blocked by the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR) antagonist (23S)-25-dehydro-1alpha(OH)-vitamin D3-26,23-lactone (MK). Bisdemethoxycurcumin (BDC) is a VDR ligand and additive with 1,25D3 in promoting Abeta42 phagocytosis by Type I, but not by Type II macrophages. Here, we define the following intracellular mechanisms regulated by 1,25D3 that are associated with recovery of phagocytosis and consistent with the selectivity of BDC: 1) 1,25D3 potentiates a 4,4-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2-disulfonic acid-sensitive chloride channel (i.e., ClC-3) currents in both Type I and II AD macrophages, but curcumin only potentiates the currents in Type I cells; 2) 1,25D3 is particularly effective in upregulating ClC-3 mRNA expression in Type II peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) while both 1,25D3 and the BDC analog, C180, upregulate VDR mRNA, repressed by Abeta42 in Type II PBMCs; and 3) 1,25D3-induced Abeta42 phagocytosis is attenuated by the calcium-dependent ClC-3 blocker, inositol 3,4,5,6-tetraphosphate (IP4), in both AD Types and by the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 only in Type II macrophages. VDR hydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled mass spectrometry and computational results show differences between the abilities of 1,25D3 and curcuminoids to stabilize VDR helices associated with the regulation of gene transcription. The structure-function results provide evidence that 1,25D3 activation of VDR-dependent genomic and nongenomic signaling, work in concert to recover dysregulated innate immune function in AD.

22208282|t|Peculiarities of copper binding to alpha-synuclein.
22208282|a|Heavy metals have been implicated as the causative agents for the pathogenesis of the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease. Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the toxic effects of metals ranging from metal-induced oxidation of protein to metal-induced changes in the protein conformation. Aggregation of a-synuclein is implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD), and various metals, including copper, constitute a prominent group of alpha-synuclein aggregation enhancers. In this study, we have systematically characterized the a-synuclein-Cu21 binding sites and analyzed the possible role of metal binding in a-synuclein fibrillation using a set of biophysical techniques, such as electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), electron spin-echo envelope modulation (ESEEM), circular dichroism (CD), and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Our analyses indicated that a-synuclein possesses at least two binding sites for Cu21. We have been able to locate one of the binding sites in the N-terminal region. Furthermore, based on the EPR studies of model peptides and Beta-synuclein, we concluded that the suspected His residue did not appear to participate in strong Cu21 binding.

22209410|t|Impaired TrkB receptor signaling contributes to memory impairment in APP/PS1 mice.
22209410|a|Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an important role in neuronal plasticity, learning, and memory. Levels of BDNF and its main receptor TrkB (TrkB.TK) have been reported to be decreased while the levels of the truncated TrkB (TrkB.T1) are increased in Alzheimer's disease. We show here that incubation with amyloid-beta increased TrkB.T1 receptor levels and decreased TrkB.TK levels in primary neurons. In vivo, APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice (APdE9) showed an age-dependent relative increase in cortical but not hippocampal TrkB.T1 receptor levels compared with TrkB.TK. To investigate the role of TrkB isoforms in Alzheimer's disease, we crossed AP mice with mice overexpressing the truncated TrkB.T1 receptor (T1) or the full-length TrkB.TK isoform. Overexpression of TrkB.T1 in APdE9 mice exacerbated their spatial memory impairment while the overexpression of TrkB.TK alleviated it. These data suggest that amyloid-beta changes the ratio between TrkB isoforms in favor of the dominant-negative TrkB.T1 isoform both in vitro and in vivo and supports the role of BDNF signaling through TrkB in the pathophysiology and cognitive deficits of Alzheimer's disease.

22209725|t|The profile of beta-amyloid precursor protein expression of rats induced by aluminum.
22209725|a|The environmental agent aluminum has been extensively investigated for a potential relationship with amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression. Despite many investigations, there is at present no definite proof from which to draw a conclusion. Since APP is an integral membrane protein expressed in different tissues and capable of fluxes across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which may ultimately affect APP level in brain, it is necessary to assess the expression profile among vital body organs. The present study compared aluminum oxide and aluminum chloride injected rats with control rats (saline treated) to observe if aluminum affected APP expression patterns in different organs by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The expression of APP was observed in the brain of aluminum chloride treated rats and in the liver of aluminum oxide injected group. Results of double IHC staining showed that it is Kupffer cells, which are located in liver sinus and expressed APP after aluminum oxide treatment. Oxidative stress is suggested as the potential pathway that aluminum chloride exert effects in brain. These results suggest that different aluminum compounds may impact the expression of APP in brain and liver tissues. The mechanism that aluminum induced liver APP expression still needs further investigation.

22212065|t|Obovatol improves cognitive functions in animal models for Alzheimer's disease.
22212065|a|Etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is obscure, but neuroinflammation and accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) are implicated in pathogenesis of AD. We have shown anti-inflammatory and neurotrophic properties of obovatol, a biphenolic compound isolated from Magnolia obovata. In this study, we examined the effect of obovatol on cognitive deficits in two separate AD models: (i) mice that received intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of Abeta(1-42) (2.0 mug/mouse) and (ii) Tg2576 mice-expressing mutant human amyloid precursor protein (K670N, M671L). Injection of Abeta(1-42) into lateral ventricle caused memory impairments in the Morris water maze and passive avoidance tasks, being associated with neuroinflammation. Abeta(1-42) -induced abnormality was significantly attenuated by administration of obovatol. When we analyzed with Tg2576 mice, long-term treatment of obovatol (1 mg/kg/day for 3 months) significantly improved cognitive function. In parallel with the improvement, treatment suppressed astroglial activation, BACE1 expression and NF-kappaB activity in the transgenic mice. Furthermore, obovatol potently inhibited fibrillation of Abetain vitro in a dose-dependent manner, as determined by Thioflavin T fluorescence and electron microscopic analysis. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that obovatol prevented memory impairments in experimental AD models, which could be attributable to amelioration of neuroinflammation and amyloidogenesis by inhibition of NF-kappaB signaling pathway and anti-fibrillogenic activity of obovatol.

22212137|t|Control of BACE1 degradation and APP processing by ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1.
22212137|a|Deposition of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) in the brain is the hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the beta-secretase in vivo essential for generation of Abeta. Previously we demonstrated that BACE1 is ubiquitinated and the degradation of BACE1 is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP). However the mechanism underlying regulation of BACE1 degradation by UPP remains elusive. Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1) is a deubiquitinating enzyme highly specific to neuron, catalyzing the hydrolysis of ubiquitin conjugates from ubiquitinated substrates. UCHL1 regulates ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation. However, whether UCHL1 is particularly involved in the proteasomal degradation of BACE1 and what is the role of UCHL1 in AD pathogenesis remain elusive. To investigate the effect of UCHL1 on BACE1 degradation, HUCH cells, a UCHL1 stably over-expressed HEK293 cell line, was established. We found that inhibition of UCHL1 significantly increased BACE1 protein level in a time-dependent manner. Half life of BACE1 was reduced in HUCH cells compared with HEK. Over-expression of UCHL1 decreased APP C-terminal fragment C99 and Abeta levels in HUCH cells. Moreover, disruption of Uchl1 gene significantly elevated levels of endogenous BACE1, C99 and Abeta in the Uchl1-null gad mice. These results demonstrated that UCHL1 accelerates BACE1 degradation and affects APP processing and Abeta production. This study suggests that potentiation of UCHL1 might be able to reduce the level of BACE1 and Abeta in brain, which makes it a novel target for AD drug development.

22212595|t|Amine oxidase activity of beta-amyloid precursor protein modulates systemic and local catecholamine levels.
22212595|a|The catecholamines dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E) are neurotransmitters and hormones that mediate stress responses in tissues and plasma. The expression of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) is responsive to stress and is high in tissues rich in catecholamines. We recently reported that APP is a ferroxidase, subsuming, in neurons and other cells, the iron-export activity that ceruloplasmin mediates in glia. Here we report that, like ceruloplasmin, APP also oxidizes synthetic amines and catecholamines catalytically (K(m) NE=0.27 mM), through a site encompassing its ferroxidase motif and selectively inhibited by zinc. Accordingly, APP knockout mice have significantly higher levels of DA, NE and E in brain, plasma and select tissues. Consistent with this, these animals have increased resting heart rate and systolic blood pressure as well as suppressed prolactin and lymphocyte levels. These findings support a role for APP in extracellular catecholaminergic clearance.

22213821|t|Evidence for astrocytosis in prodromal Alzheimer disease provided by 11C-deuterium-L-deprenyl: a multitracer PET paradigm combining 11C-Pittsburgh compound B and 18F-FDG.
22213821|a|UNLABELLED: Astrocytes colocalize with fibrillar amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques in postmortem Alzheimer disease (AD) brain tissue. It is therefore of great interest to develop a PET tracer for visualizing astrocytes in vivo, enabling the study of the regional distribution of both astrocytes and fibrillar Abeta. A multitracer PET investigation was conducted for patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), patients with mild AD, and healthy controls using (11)C-deuterium-L-deprenyl ((11)C-DED) to measure monoamine oxidase B located in astrocytes. Along with (11)C-DED PET, (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B ((11)C-PIB; fibrillar Abeta deposition), (18)F-FDG (glucose metabolism), T1 MRI, cerebrospinal fluid, and neuropsychologic data were acquired from the patients. METHODS: (11)C-DED PET was performed in MCI patients (n = 8; mean age +- SD, 62.6 +- 7.5 y; mean Mini Mental State Examination, 27.5 +- 2.1), AD patients (n = 7; mean age, 65.1 +- 6.3 y; mean Mini Mental State Examination, 24.4 +- 5.7), and healthy age-matched controls (n = 14; mean age, 64.7 +- 3.6 y). A modified reference Patlak model, with cerebellar gray matter as a reference, was chosen for kinetic analysis of the (11)C-DED data. (11)C-DED data from 20 to 60 min were analyzed using a digital brain atlas. Mean regional (18)F-FDG uptake and (11)C-PIB retention were calculated for each patient, with cerebellar gray matter as a reference. RESULTS: ANOVA analysis of the regional (11)C-DED binding data revealed a significant group effect in the bilateral frontal and bilateral parietal cortices related to increased binding in the MCI patients. All patients, except 3 with MCI, showed high (11)C-PIB retention. Increased (11)C-DED binding in most cortical and subcortical regions was observed in MCI (11)C-PIB+ patients relative to controls, MCI (11)C-PIB (negative) patients, and AD patients. No regional correlations were found between the 3 PET tracers. CONCLUSION: Increased (11)C-DED binding throughout the brain of the MCI (11)C-PIB+ patients potentially suggests that astrocytosis is an early phenomenon in AD development.

22214648|t|High magnetic field quantum transport in Au nanoparticle-cellulose films.
22214648|a|We report the magneto-transport properties of cellulose films comprising interconnected networks of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs). Cellulose is a biopolymer that can be made electrically conducting by cellulose regeneration in Au NP dispersions. The mechanism of electronic conduction in the Au-cellulose films changes from variable range hopping to metallic-like conduction with decreasing resistivity. Our experiments in high magnetic fields (up to 45 T) reveal negative magnetoresistance in the highly resistive films. This is attributed to the spin polarization of the Au NPs and the magnetic field induced suppression of electron spin flips during spin-polarized tunneling in the NP network.

22214781|t|Amyloid-beta oligomers in cerebrospinal fluid are associated with cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
22214781|a|Oligomers of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) are thought to be the most toxic form of Abeta and are linked to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we used a flow cytometric approach for the detection and assessment of oligomers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from AD patients and other neurological disorders. 30 CSF samples from patients suffering from AD (n = 14), non-demented controls (n = 12), and other neurological disorders (dementia with Lewy bodies, n = 2; vascular dementia, n = 1; primary progressive aphasia, n = 1) were analyzed for the presence of Abeta-oligomers by flow cytometry. The CSF levels of total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and amyloid-beta (Abeta)42 were determined using ELISA. CSF Abeta-oligomer levels in AD patients were elevated in comparison to the non-AD group (p = 0.073). The ratio Abeta-oligomers/Abeta42 was significantly elevated in AD subjects compared to non-AD subjects (p = 0.001). Most important, there was a negative correlation between the amount of Abeta-oligomers and the Mini-Mental Status Exam score (r = -0.65; p = 0.013) in AD patients. The detection of Abeta-oligomers using flow cytometry analysis seems to be useful in assessing the stage of AD. This is a novel and important finding as none of the currently used CSF biomarkers are clearly associated with dementia severity.

22214783|t|Down-regulation of amyloid-beta through AMPK activation by inhibitors of GSK-3beta in SH-SY5Y and SH-SY5Y-AbetaPP695 cells.
22214783|a|Glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), implicating amyloid-beta (Abeta) production, neurofibrillary tangle formation, and neuronal apoptosis. The activation of 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has been linked to aberrant processing of amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP), and AMPK signaling controls Abeta metabolism. It is possible that GSK-3beta regulated the activation of the AMPK pathway. To test this hypothesis, the influence of GSK-3beta on the expression of AbetaPP cleavage enzyme (BACE), Abeta, and AMPK in the SH-SY5Y and AbetaPP695 cells line through three inhibitors of GSK-3beta was analyzed. Expression of Abeta, AMPK, and pAMPK172 was measured by Western blot, and BACE was tested by Western blot and RT-PCR. This study demonstrated that suppression of GSK-3beta activity, through specific inhibitors, dramatically down-regulated Abeta generation in human SH-SY5Y and SH-SY5Y-AbetaPP695 cells by enhancing AMPK activity to down-regulate Abeta. These results suggest GSK-3beta inhibitors may be promising agents in the prevention and treatment of AD.

22217000|t|Atomic force microscopy and MD simulations reveal pore-like structures of all-D-enantiomer of Alzheimer's beta-amyloid peptide: relevance to the ion channel mechanism of AD pathology.
22217000|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a protein misfolding disease characterized by a buildup of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide as senile plaques, uncontrolled neurodegeneration, and memory loss. AD pathology is linked to the destabilization of cellular ionic homeostasis and involves Abeta peptide-plasma membrane interactions. In principle, there are two possible ways through which disturbance of the ionic homeostasis can take place: directly, where the Abeta peptide either inserts into the membrane and creates ion-conductive pores or destabilizes the membrane organization, or, indirectly, where the Abeta peptide interacts with existing cell membrane receptors. To distinguish between these two possible types of Abeta-membrane interactions, we took advantage of the biochemical tenet that ligand-receptor interactions are stereospecific; L-amino acid peptides, but not their D-counterparts, bind to cell membrane receptors. However, with respect to the ion channel-mediated mechanism, like L-amino acids, D-amino acid peptides will also form ion channel-like structures. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM), we imaged the structures of both D- and L-enantiomers of the full length Abeta(1-42) when reconstituted in lipid bilayers. AFM imaging shows that both L- and D-Abeta isomers form similar channel-like structures. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations support the AFM imaged 3D structures. Previously, we have shown that D-Abeta(1-42) channels conduct ions similarly to their L- counterparts. Taken together, our results support the direct mechanism of Abeta ion channel-mediated destabilization of ionic homeostasis rather than the indirect mechanism through Abeta interaction with membrane receptors.

22217419|t|Vitamin D rejuvenates aging eyes by reducing inflammation, clearing amyloid beta and improving visual function.
22217419|a|Vitamin D(3) plays a key role in immune regulation and may protect against the aging process. A focal point for age-related changes is the outer retina of the eye where there is high metabolic demand resulting in a gradual increase in extracellular deposition, inflammation, and cell loss giving rise to visual decline. Here, we demonstrate that vitamin D(3) administration for only 6 weeks in aged mice significantly impacts on this aging process. Treated mice showed significant reductions in retinal inflammation and levels of amyloid beta (Abeta) accumulation, which is a hallmark of aging. They also had significant reductions in retinal macrophage numbers and marked shifts in their morphology. These changes were reflected in a significant improvement in visual function, revealing that vitamin D(3) is a route to avoiding the pace of age-related visual decline. Excess amyloid beta deposition and inflammation are risk factors leading to age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the largest cause of blindness in those older than 50 years in developed countries. Recently, vitamin D(3) has been linked epidemiologically to protection against age-related macular degeneration. Hence, vitamin D(3) enrichment is likely to represent a beneficial route for those at risk.

22219198|t|Tannic acid is a natural beta-secretase inhibitor that prevents cognitive impairment and mitigates Alzheimer-like pathology in transgenic mice.
22219198|a|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) proteolysis is essential for production of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides that form beta-amyloid plaques in brains of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients. Recent focus has been directed toward a group of naturally occurring anti-amyloidogenic polyphenols known as flavonoids. We orally administered the flavonoid tannic acid (TA) to the transgenic PSAPP mouse model of cerebral amyloidosis (bearing mutant human APP and presenilin-1 transgenes) and evaluated cognitive function and AD-like pathology. Consumption of TA for 6 months prevented transgene-associated behavioral impairment including hyperactivity, decreased object recognition, and defective spatial reference memory, but did not alter nontransgenic mouse behavior. Accordingly, brain parenchymal and cerebral vascular beta-amyloid deposits and abundance of various Abeta species including oligomers were mitigated in TA-treated PSAPP mice. These effects occurred with decreased cleavage of the beta-carboxyl-terminal APP fragment, lowered soluble APP-beta production, reduced beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 protein stability and activity, and attenuated neuroinflammation. As in vitro validation, we treated well characterized mutant human APP-overexpressing murine neuron-like cells with TA and found significantly reduced Abeta production associated with less amyloidogenic APP proteolysis. Taken together, these results raise the possibility that dietary supplementation with TA may be prophylactic for AD by inhibiting beta-secretase activity and neuroinflammation and thereby mitigating AD pathology.

22223485|t|Differing effects of toxicants (methylmercury, inorganic mercury, lead, amyloid beta, and rotenone) on cultured rat cerebrocortical neurons: differential expression of rho proteins associated with neurotoxicity.
22223485|a|Methylmercury (MeHg), inorganic mercury (IHg), lead (Pb), amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), and rotenone (RTN) are well-known toxicants. Here, we demonstrate that these five toxicants exhibit differing effects on cerebrocortical neurons. The concentration responsible for 30% loss of viability (EC30) values 3 days after exposure was approximately 100nM for MeHg, IHg, and RTN and 10muM for Abeta. Neuritic degeneration and subsequent apoptotic cell death were observed in these toxicant-treated cells. In contrast, the EC30 value 3 days after exposure to Pb was > 10muM. We clarified the differential expression of Ras homolog gene (Rho) family proteins (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 [Rac1], cell division cycle 42, and Ras homolog gene family, member A [RhoA]) upon exposure to these five toxicants. Exposure to 100nM MeHg, IHg, or RTN downregulated the expression of Rac1, related to neuritic extension, but did not affect RhoA, related to retraction. At a higher concentration (1muM), IHg and RTN also acted through the suppression of Rac1, whereas increased MeHg toxicity was not associated with the expression of Rho family proteins. On the other hand, Pb and Abeta showed no effects on the expression of Rho proteins. Modification of the balance of neuritic extension and retraction by the suppression of Rho A rescued the neurotoxicity of 100nM MeHg, IHg, and RTN. The results indicate that the imbalance of neuritic extension and retraction by the suppression of Rac1 by 100nM MeHg, IHg, and RTN causes cerebrocortical neuron axonal degeneration and cell death. By contrast, the neurotoxicities of Pb, Abeta, and MeHg (at higher concentrations) are conferred by other toxic mechanisms.

22223639|t|Cdk5 protein inhibition and Abeta42 increase BACE1 protein level in primary neurons by a post-transcriptional mechanism: implications of CDK5 as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer disease.
22223639|a|The beta-secretase enzyme BACE1 initiates production of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide that comprises plaques in Alzheimer disease (AD) brain. BACE1 levels are increased in AD, potentially accelerating Abeta generation, but the mechanisms of BACE1 elevation are not fully understood. Cdk5/p25 has been implicated in neurodegeneration and BACE1 regulation, suggesting therapeutic Cdk5 inhibition for AD. In addition, caspase 3 has been implicated in BACE1 elevation. Here, we show that the Cdk5 level and p25:p35 ratio were elevated and correlated with BACE1 level in brains of AD patients and 5XFAD transgenic mice. Mouse primary cortical neurons treated with Abeta42 oligomers had increased BACE1 level and p25:p35 ratio. Surprisingly, the Abeta42-induced BACE1 elevation was not blocked by Cdk5 inhibitors CP68130 and roscovitine, and instead the BACE1 level was increased greater than with Abeta42 treatment alone. Moreover, Cdk5 inhibitors alone elevated BACE1 in a time- and dose-dependent manner that coincided with increased caspase 3 cleavage and decreased Cdk5 level. Caspase 3 inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD failed to prevent the Abeta42-induced BACE1 increase. Further experiments suggested that the Abeta42-induced BACE1 elevation was the result of a post-transcriptional mechanism. We conclude that Abeta42 may increase the BACE1 level independently of either Cdk5 or caspase 3 and that Cdk5 inhibition for AD may cause BACE1 elevation, a potentially negative therapeutic outcome.

22225807|t|NMR solution structure of rat abeta(1-16): toward understanding the mechanism of rats' resistance to Alzheimer's disease.
22225807|a|In an attempt to reveal the mechanism of rats' resistance to Alzheimer's disease, we determined the structure of the metal-binding domain 1-16 of rat beta-amyloid (rat Abeta(1-16)) in solution in the absence and presence of zinc ions. A zinc-induced dimerization of the domain was detected. The zinc coordination site was found to involve residues His-6 and His-14 of both peptide chains. We used experimental restraints obtained from analyses of NMR and isothermal titration calorimetry data to perform structure calculations. The calculations employed an explicit water environment and a simulated annealing molecular-dynamics protocol followed by quantum-mechanical/molecular-mechanical optimization. We found that the C-tails of the two polypeptide chains of the rat Abeta(1-16) dimer are oriented in opposite directions to each other, which hinders the assembly of rat Abeta dimers into oligomeric aggregates. Thus, the differences in the structure of zinc-binding sites of human and rat Abeta(1-16), their ability to form regular cross-monomer bonds, and the orientation of their hydrophobic C-tails could be responsible for the resistance of rats to Alzheimer's disease.

22226004|t|Comparison of the global statistical test and composite outcome for secondary analyses of multiple coronary heart disease outcomes.
22226004|a|Multiple outcomes (or multiple endpoints), such as mortality and recurrent myocardial infarction, are increasingly common in clinical trials and are often of interest in secondary analyses. Traditionally, a clinical trial protocol is built around a single event as its primary outcome, with several secondary outcomes specified, the analyses for which lack the same level of power. To accommodate all the relevant outcomes and to increase the power of the comparison in trials evaluating the efficacy of treatments for coronary heart disease, investigators often chose to construct a composite outcome. The more conventional composite outcome fails to account for the relative importance and the relationship (correlation) among its components. The purpose of this work is to demonstrate the usefulness of the Global Statistical Test, which considers the correlation between multiple outcomes, as an alternative strategy for these situations and to demonstrate its effect on hypothesis testing and power analysis issues in comparison with the traditional composite outcome analysis. Data from the cardiovascular clinical trial Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Population are used as an example.

The successful introduction of [(11)C]PIB as a PET tracer for the amyloid plaques less than 10 years ago started an intensive research, and numerous new compounds for use in molecular imaging of the amyloid plaques have been developed. The candidates are based on dyes like thioflavin T, Congo red and chrysamine G, but also on other types such as benzoxazoles, curcumin and stilbenes. In the present review, we present methods of the radiochemistry and preclinical evaluation as well as the main properties of some of these compounds.

22226742|t|Cortical surface mapping using topology correction, partial flattening and 3D shape context-based non-rigid registration for use in quantifying atrophy in Alzheimer's disease.
22226742|a|Magnetic resonance (MR) provides a non-invasive way to investigate changes in the brain resulting from aging or neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Performing accurate analysis for population studies is challenging because of the interindividual anatomical variability. A large set of tools is found to perform studies of brain anatomy and population analysis (FreeSurfer, SPM, FSL). In this paper we present a newly developed surface-based processing pipeline (MILXCTE) that allows accurate vertex-wise statistical comparisons of brain modifications, such as cortical thickness (CTE). The brain is first segmented into the three main tissues: white matter, gray matter and cerebrospinal fluid, after CTE is computed, a topology corrected mesh is generated. Partial inflation and non-rigid registration of cortical surfaces to a common space using shape context are then performed. Each of the steps was firstly validated using MR images from the OASIS database. We then applied the pipeline to a sample of individuals randomly selected from the AIBL study on AD and compared with FreeSurfer. For a population of 50 individuals we found correlation of cortical thickness in all the regions of the brain (average r=0.62 left and r=0.64 right hemispheres). We finally computed changes in atrophy in 32 AD patients and 81 healthy elderly individuals. Significant differences were found in regions known to be affected in AD. We demonstrated the validity of the method for use in clinical studies which provides an alternative to well established techniques to compare different imaging biomarkers for the study of neurodegenerative diseases.

22226743|t|Cisterna magna cannulated repeated CSF sampling rat model--effects of a gamma-secretase inhibitor on Abeta levels.
22226743|a|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) provides a window into central nervous system (CNS) physiology and pathophysiology in human neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Changes in CSF bioanalytes also provide a direct readout of target engagement in the CNS following pharmacological interventions in clinical trials. Given the importance of tracking CNS bioanalytes in drug discovery, we have developed a novel cisterna magna cannulated rat model for repeated CSF sampling and used it to assess an amyloid beta (Abeta) lowering agent. The surgically implanted cisterna magna cannula was patent over a period of 1-2 weeks and enabled repeated sampling of CSF (volume of ~30-50muL/sample) from each rat. CSF Abeta40 levels showed good intra-animal variability across time points and inter-animal variability within a time point. Peripheral treatment with a gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI) led to a rapid and robust decline in CSF Abeta40 levels that returned to baseline over 24-96h after dosing. Terminal brain, CSF and plasma Abeta levels measured at 24h after dosing demonstrated robust Abeta lowering and showed excellent correlation across these compartments. These results are the first pharmacological validation of the repeated CSF sampling rat model for Abeta lowering agents. This model can have broad applicability in pharmacological evaluation for diverse CNS targets.

22227005|t|Age-dependent disruption in hippocampal theta oscillation in amyloid-beta overproducing transgenic mice.
22227005|a|Transgenic mice are used to model increased brain amyloid-beta (Abeta) and amyloid plaque formation reflecting Alzheimer's disease pathology. In our study hippocampal network oscillations, population spikes, and long-term potentiation (LTP) were recorded in APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) and presenilin1 (PS1) transgenic and wild type mice at 2, 4, and 8 months of age under urethane anesthesia. Hippocampal theta oscillations elicited by brainstem stimulation were similar in wild type and PS1 mice at all age groups. In contrast, APP/PS1 mice showed an age-dependent decrease in hippocampal activity, characterized by a significant decline in elicited theta power and frequency at 4 and 8 months. Magnitudes of population spikes and long-term potentiation in the dentate gyrus were similar across groups at both 4 and 8 months. In APP/PS1 mice, soluble and insoluble Abeta, and hippocampal and cortical plaque load increased with age, and the disruption in hippocampal theta oscillation showed a significant correlation with plaque load. Our study shows that, using in vivo electrophysiological methods, early Abeta-related functional deficits can be robustly detected in the brainstem-hippocampus multisynaptic network.

22227054|t|Monitoring blood flow alterations in the Tg2576 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease by in vivo magnetic resonance angiography at 17.6 T.
22227054|a|Many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease are linked to abnormalities in the vascular system. In AD, the deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide in the cerebral vessel walls, known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is frequently observed, leading to blood flow abnormalities. Visualization of the changes in vascular structure is important for early diagnosis and treatment. Blood vessels can be imaged non-invasively by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). In this study we optimized high resolution MRA at 17.6 T to longitudinally monitor morphological changes in cerebral arteries in a Tg2576 mouse model, a widely used model of AD. Our results at 17.6 T show that MRA significantly benefits from the ultra-high magnetic field strength especially to visualize smaller vessels. Visual and quantitative analysis of MRA results revealed severe blood flow defects in large and medium sized arteries in Tg2576 mice. In particular blood flow defects were observed in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and in the anterior communicating artery (AComA) in Tg2576 mice. Histological data show that Abeta levels in the vessel wall may be responsible for impaired cerebral blood flow, thereby contributing to the early progression of AD. To our knowledge this is the first ultra-high field MRA study monitoring blood flow alterations longitudinally in living Tg2576 mice, consequently providing a powerful tool to test new therapeutic intervention related to CAA in a mouse model of AD.

22230888|t|Early brain amyloidosis in APP/PS1 mice with serum insulin-like growth factor-I deficiency.
22230888|a|The influence of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) on the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is discussed controversially. To help clarify the role of this circulating neurotrophic factor in brain amyloidosis, the major pathological trait in AD, we analyzed plaque formation in a mouse model of AD transgenic for human APP and PS1 mutations with reduced serum IGF-I levels (LIDAD mice). We found that brain amyloidosis in LIDAD mice appeared earlier than in AD mice, at 2 months of age, while attained comparable levels at 6 months. In parallel, early microgliosis was observed in LIDAD mice also at 2 months and remained exacerbated at 6 months. Collectively, these observations suggest a role of serum IGF-I in delaying early brain amyloidosis.

22232001|t|Amyloid-beta protein precursor regulates phosphorylation and cellular compartmentalization of microtubule associated protein tau.
22232001|a|Tau is a multifunctional protein detected in different cellular compartments in neuronal and non-neuronal cells. When hyperphosphorylated and aggregated in atrophic neurons, tau is considered the culprit for neuronal death in familial and sporadic tauopathies. With regards to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, it is not yet established whether entangled tau represents a cause or a consequence of neurodegeneration. In fact, it is unquestionably accepted that amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) plays a pivotal role in the genesis of the disease, and it is postulated that the formation of toxic amyloid-beta peptides from AbetaPP is the primary event that subsequently induces abnormal tau phosphorylation. In this work, we show that in the brain of AD patients there is an imbalance between the nuclear and the cytoskeletal pools of phospho-tau. We observed that in non-AD subjects, there is a stable pool of phospho-tau which remains strictly confined to neuronal nuclei, while nuclear localization of phospho-tau is significantly underrepresented in neurons of AD patients bearing neurofibrillary tangles. A specific phosphorylation of tau is required during mitosis in vitro and in vivo, likely via a Grb2-ERK1/2 signaling cascade. In differentiated neuronal A1 cells, the overexpression of AbetaPP modulates tau phosphorylation, altering the ratio between cytoskeletal and nuclear pools, and correlates with cell death. Altogether our data provide evidence that AbetaPP, in addition to amyloid formation, modulates the phosphorylation of tau and its subcellular compartmentalization, an event that may lead to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles and to neurodegeneration when occurring in postmitotic neurons.

22232002|t|Molecules of the quinoline family block tau self-aggregation: implications toward a therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease.
22232002|a|The neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) generated by self-aggregation of anomalous forms of tau represent a neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). These lesions begin to form long before the clinical manifestation of AD, and its severity is correlated with cognitive impairment in patients. We focused on the search for molecules that interact with aggregated tau of the Alzheimer's type and that may block its aggregation before the formation of NFTs. We show that molecules from a family of quinolines interact specifically with oligomeric forms of tau, inhibiting their assembly into AD filaments. The quinolines 2-(4-methylphenyl)-6-methyl quinoline (THQ-4S) and 2-(4-aminophenyl)-6-methylquinoline (THQ-55) inhibited in vitro aggregation of heparin-induced polymers of purified brain tau and aggregates of human recombinant tau. They also interact with paired helical filaments (PHFs) purified from AD postmortem brains. In vitro studies indicated a significantly lower inhibitory effect of amyloid-beta42 on the aggregation, suggesting that tau aggregates are specific targets for quinoline interactions. These compounds showed highly lipophilic properties as corroborated with the analysis of total polar surface areas, and evaluation of their molecular properties. Moreover, these quinolines exhibit physical chemical properties similar to drugs able to penetrate the human brain blood barrier. Docking studies based on tau modeling, as a structural approach to the analysis of the interaction of tau-binding ligands, indicated that a C-terminal tau moiety, involved in the formation of PHFs, seems to be a site for binding of quinolines. Studies suggest the potential clinical use of these quinolines and of their derivatives to inhibit tau aggregation and possible therapeutic routes for AD.

22232004|t|Hippocampal GABAergic neurons are susceptible to amyloid-beta toxicity in vitro and are decreased in number in the Alzheimer's disease TgCRND8 mouse model.
22232004|a|The relevance of gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA)-ergic dysfunctions in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a matter of debate. In the present study, we characterized the toxicity of amyloid-beta (Abeta) on hippocampal GABAergic neurons both in vivo and in vitro. In the TgCRND8 mouse model of AD, we found a significant decrease in the number of hippocampal neurons immunoreactive for glutamate decarboxylase 67 (GAD67), the enzyme synthesizing GABA. This decrease, which was specific for hippocampal CA1-3 fields, was observed at 6 months of age, long after the overproduction of soluble Abeta42 (between 2 and 4 months) and accumulation of insoluble Abeta into amyloid plaques (between 4 and 6 months). In vitro, neurotoxicity was observed in primary hippocampal cultures 72 h following the addition of Abeta42 solutions containing a mixture of soluble oligomers. Taken together, our results suggest that when cultured and exposed to Abeta in vitro, GABAergic neurons are susceptible to Abeta42 neurotoxicity. However, in TgCRND8 mice, the number of GABAergic neurons is not altered up to 6 months, in spite of the massive Abeta load. Combined with the previously reported increased sensitivity to seizures observed in younger (1.5-2 month-old) TgCRND8 mice, it is likely that Abeta toxicity leads to GABAergic neuron dysfunction prior to their losses at a later stage.

22232005|t|Therapeutic albumin binding to remove amyloid-beta.
22232005|a|Clearance of plasma amyloid-beta (Abeta) through plasma exchange and replacement with therapeutic albumin to facilitate net Abeta efflux from the brain to plasma is a novel approach for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, thorough characterization of the capacity of therapeutic albumin to bind Abeta is warranted. In this study, Abeta40 and Abeta42 were quantified by commercial ELISA or Araclon ABtest  in samples of Grifols' therapeutic albumin (Albutein ) 5%, 20%, and 25%. The capacity of Albutein  to bind Abeta was assessed by: a) ELISA in serially diluted therapeutic albumin (0-45 mg/ml protein concentration) to which 80 pg/ml of synthetic Abeta peptide (sAbeta40 or sAbeta42) were added; b) ELISA in samples of the therapeutic albumin containing serially diluted sAbeta40 or sAbeta42 (60-400 pg/ml); and c) surface plasmon resonance (SPR) for sAbeta42 binding. The Abeta content in Albutein  was below the quantification threshold of the ELISA tests (<25 to <62.5 pg/ml) and ABtest  (<3.125 pg/ml). Quantification of exogenously added sAbeta42 decreased in parallel with increasing protein concentration (59-78% at 45 mg/ml albumin). Recovery of sAbeta serially diluted in Albutein  was ~60% for sAbeta40 and ~70% for sAbeta42, but was ~100% in control samples without albumin. The KD by SPR analysis for sAbeta42 interaction with Albutein  was 1.72 +- 0.24 x 10-6 M. In conclusion, Grifols' therapeutic albumin has undetectable content of Abeta40 and Abeta42. Moreover, Grifols' therapeutic albumin consistently binds peptides containing the primary sequence of human Abeta.

22232006|t|Performance of abeta1-40, abeta1-42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau as predictors of dementia in a cohort of patients with mild cognitive impairment.
22232006|a|Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a common condition in the elderly which may remain stable along time (MCI-MCI) or evolve into Alzheimer's disease (MCI-AD) or other dementias. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) classical biomarkers, i.e., amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta1-42), total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) reflect the neuropathological changes taking place in AD brains, thus disclosing the disease in its prodromal phase. With the aim to evaluate the power of each biomarker and/or their combination in predicting AD progression, we have measured CSF Abeta1-40, Abeta1-42, t-tau, and p-tau in patients with AD, MCI-MCI, MCI-AD, and other neurological diseases without dementia (OND) followed up for four years. Abeta1-42 levels were significantly lower in AD and MCI-AD than in MCI-MCI. T-tau and p-tau levels were significantly increased in AD and MCI-AD versus OND and MCI-MCI. The Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 ratio showed a significant decrease in AD and MCI-AD as compared to MCI-MCI. Both Abeta1-42/t-tau and Abeta1-42/p-tau ratios showed significantly decreased values in AD and MCI-AD with respect to OND and MCI-MCI. Abeta1-42/p-tau ratio was the best parameter for discriminating MCI-AD from MCI-MCI (sensitivity 81%, specificity 95%), being also correlated with the annual change rate in the Mini Mental State Examination annual change rate score (MMSE-ACR, rS = -0.71, p < 0.0001). Survival analysis showed that 81% of MCI with a low Abeta1-42/p-tau ratio (<1372) progressed to AD. The best model of logistic regression analysis retained Abeta1-42 and p-tau (sensitivity 75%, 95%CI: 70-80%; specificity 96%, 95%CI: 94-98%). We can conclude that Abeta1-42 and p-tau reliably predict conversion to AD in MCI patients.

22232007|t|Antibody 9D5 recognizes oligomeric pyroglutamate amyloid-beta in a fraction of amyloid-beta deposits in Alzheimer's disease without cross-reactivity with other protein aggregates.
22232007|a|Recent evidence suggests that soluble oligomeric amyloid-beta (Abeta) assemblies are critically involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have generated a conformation-dependent monoclonal antibody (9D5) that selectively recognizes low-molecular weight AbetapE3 oligomers, and demonstrated its diagnostic and therapeutic potential. Here, we further characterize the specificity of this antibody by evaluating a spectrum of neurodegeneration-related protein deposits for cross-reactivity, and by comparing the staining pattern of 9D5 with a generic Abeta antibody that targets a linear epitope (mAb NT244), and with another conformation-dependent Abeta antibody that selectively labels amyloid fibrils of various molecular weights (pAb OC). The 9D5 antibody does not cross-react with other aggregated protein deposits in brains of progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, argyrophilic grain disease, Pick's disease, Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, frontotemporal lobar degeneration or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with TDP-43 inclusions, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and vessel changes in Binswanger encephalopathy, demonstrating the specificity of 9D5 for Abeta deposits. While NT244 and OC showed a comparable plaque load, 9D5 detected only approximately 15% of the total Abeta plaque load in the entorhinal cortex, the CA1 region, and the temporal neocortex. Our study further supports a possible therapeutic advantage of 9D5 by the highly specific recognition of an epitope found only in oligomeric assemblies of AbetapE3 of AD patients. Moreover, selective binding to only a pathogenetically relevant fraction of Abeta deposits serves as rationale for passive immunization with 9D5-derivatives by limiting potential side effects of vaccination due to dissolvement of existing amyloid deposits.

22232013|t|Altered serum iron and copper homeostasis predicts cognitive decline in mild cognitive impairment.
22232013|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain is marked by severe neuronal death which has been partly attributed to increased oxidative stress. The pathophysiology accounting for this free radical injury is not well-delineated at this point, but one hypothesis is that a derangement in transition metal metabolism contributes to the process. We tested the hypothesis that peripheral derangement of transition metal metabolism is present early in the dementing process. We analyzed non-heme iron and copper levels in serum from subjects with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and early stage senile dementia and followed these subjects over 5 years. An increase in the ratio of serum copper to non-heme iron levels predicted which subjects with mild cognitive impairment would progress to dementia versus those that would remain cognitively stable. This increase did not correlate with changes in expression of iron regulatory protein 2 or selected downstream targets in peripheral lymphocytes. A cDNA-based microarray (IronChip) containing genes relevant to iron and copper metabolism was used to assess transition metal metabolism in circulating lymphocytes from cognitively normal and demented subjects. No gene was identified as being dysregulated more than 2-fold, and verification using quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated no significant changes in expression for ALAS2, FOS, and CTR1. The increased ratio of serum copper to serum iron prior to dementia has potential as a biomarker for cognitive decline and mirrors other changes in serum previously reported by others, but iron and copper metabolism pathways appear to be broadly unaffected in peripheral blood in AD.

22232014|t|Characterization of insulin degrading enzyme and other amyloid-beta degrading proteases in human serum: a role in Alzheimer's disease?
22232014|a|Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients have low amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) clearance in the central nervous system. The peripheral Abeta clearance may also be important but its role in AD remains unclear. We aimed to study the Abeta degrading proteases including insulin degrading enzyme (IDE), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and others in blood. Using the fluorogenic substrate V (a substrate of IDE and other metalloproteases), we showed that human serum degraded the substrate V, and the activity was inhibited by adding increasing dose of Abeta. The existence of IDE activity was demonstrated by the inhibition of insulin, amylin, or EDTA, and further confirmed by immunocapture of IDE using monoclonal antibodies. The involvement of ACE was indicated by the ability of the ACE inhibitor, lisinopril, to inhibit the substrate V degradation. To test the variations of substrate V degradation in humans, we used serum samples from a homebound elderly population with cognitive diagnoses. Compared with the elderly who had normal cognition, those with probable AD and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (amnestic MCI) had lower peptidase activities. Probable AD or amnestic MCI as an outcome remained negatively associated with serum substrate V degradation activity after adjusting for the confounders. The elderly with probable AD had lower serum substrate V degradation activity compared with those who had vascular dementia. The blood proteases mediating Abeta degradation may be important for the AD pathogenesis. More studies are needed to specify each Abeta degrading protease in blood as a useful biomarker and a possible treatment target for AD.

22232206|t|Exercise Engagement as a Moderator of the Effects of APOE Genotype on Amyloid Deposition.
22232206|a|OBJECTIVE: APOE epsilon4 status has been associated with greater cortical amyloid deposition, whereas exercise has been associated with less in cognitively normal adults. The primary objective here was to examine whether physical exercise moderates the association between APOE genotype and amyloid deposition in cognitively normal adults. DESIGN: APOE genotyping data and answers to a questionnaire on physical exercise engagement over the last decade were obtained in conjunction with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples and amyloid imaging with carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B ([(11)C]PiB) positron emission tomography. Participants were classified as either low or high exercisers based on exercise guidelines of the American Heart Association. SETTING: Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at Washington University, St Louis, Missouri. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 201 cognitively normal adults (135 of whom were women) aged 45 to 88 years were recruited from the Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. Samples of CSF were collected from 165 participants. Amyloid imaging was performed for 163 participants. RESULTS: APOE epsilon4 carriers evidenced higher [(11)C]PiB binding (P<.001) and lower CSF Abeta42 levels (P<.001) than did noncarriers. Our previous findings of higher [(11)C]PiB binding (P=.005) and lower CSF Abeta42 levels (P=.009) in more sedentary individuals were replicated. Most importantly, we observed a novel interaction between APOE status and exercise engagement for [(11)C]PiB binding (P=.008) such that a more sedentary lifestyle was significantly associated with higher [(11)C]PiB binding for epsilon4 carriers (P=.013) but not for noncarriers (P=.20). All findings remained significant after controlling for age; sex; educational level; body mass index; the presence or history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart problems, or depression; and the interval between assessments. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these results suggest that cognitively normal sedentary APOE epsilon4-positive individuals may be at augmented risk for cerebral amyloid deposition.

22232345|t|11C-PiB imaging of human immunodeficiency virus-associated neurocognitive disorder.
22232345|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the amyloid-binding agent carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B ((11)C-PiB) could differentiate Alzheimer disease (AD) from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) in middle-aged HIV-positive participants. DESIGN: (11)C-PiB scanning, clinical assessment, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis were performed. Both chi(2) and t tests assessed differences in clinical and demographic variables between HIV-positive participants and community-living individuals observed at the Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC). Analysis of variance assessed for regional differences in amyloid-beta protein 1-42 (Abeta42) using (11)C-PiB. SETTING: An ADRC and HIV clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen HIV-positive participants (11 cognitively normal and 5 with HAND) and 19 ADRC participants (8 cognitively normal and 11 with symptomatic AD). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean and regional (11)C-PiB binding potentials. RESULTS: Participants with symptomatic AD were older (P < .001), had lower CSF Abeta42 levels (P < .001), and had higher CSF tau levels (P < .001) than other groups. Regardless of degree of impairment, HIV-positive participants did not have increased (11)C-PiB levels. Mean and regional binding potentials were elevated for symptomatic AD participants (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Middle-aged HIV-positive participants, even with HAND, do not exhibit increased (11)C-PiB levels, whereas symptomatic AD individuals have increased fibrillar Abeta42 deposition in cortical and subcortical regions. Observed dissimilarities between HAND and AD may reflect differences in Abeta42 metabolism. (11)C-PiB may provide a diagnostic biomarker for distinguishing symptomatic AD from HAND in middle-aged HIV-positive participants. Future cross-sectional and longitudinal studies are required to assess the utility of (11)C-PiB in older individuals with HAND.

22232349|t|Proteomic changes in cerebrospinal fluid of presymptomatic and affected persons carrying familial Alzheimer disease mutations.
22232349|a|OBJECTIVE: To identify cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein changes in persons who will develop familial Alzheimer disease (FAD) due to PSEN1 and APP mutations, using unbiased proteomics. DESIGN: We compared proteomic profiles of CSF from individuals with FAD who were mutation carriers (MCs) and related noncarriers (NCs). Abundant proteins were depleted and samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry on a high-resolution time-of-flight instrument. Tryptic peptides were identified by tandem mass spectrometry. Proteins differing in concentration between the MCs and NCs were identified. SETTING: A tertiary dementia referral center and a proteomic biomarker discovery laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Fourteen FAD MCs (mean age, 34.2 years; 10 are asymptomatic, 12 have presenilin-1 [PSEN1 ] gene mutations, and 2 have amyloid precursor protein [APP ] gene mutations) and 5 related NCs (mean age, 37.6 years). RESULTS: Fifty-six proteins were identified, represented by multiple tryptic peptides showing significant differences between MCs and NCs (46 upregulated and 10 downregulated); 40 of these proteins differed when the analysis was restricted to asymptomatic individuals. Fourteen proteins have been reported in prior proteomic studies in late-onset AD, including amyloid precursor protein, transferrin, alpha(1)beta-glycoprotein, complement components, afamin precursor, spondin 1, plasminogen, hemopexin, and neuronal pentraxin receptor. Many other proteins were unique to our study, including calsyntenin 3, AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) 4 glutamate receptor, CD99 antigen, di- N-acetyl-chitobiase, and secreted phosphoprotein 1. CONCLUSIONS: We found much overlap in CSF protein changes between individuals with presymptomatic and symptomatic FAD and those with late-onset AD. Our results are consistent with inflammation and synaptic loss early in FAD and suggest new presymptomatic biomarkers of potential usefulness in drug development.

22233683|t|Contrasting protective effects of cannabinoids against oxidative stress and amyloid-beta evoked neurotoxicity in vitro.
22233683|a|Cannabinoids have been widely reported to have neuroprotective properties in vitro and in vivo. In this study we compared the effects of CB1 and CB2 receptor-selective ligands, the endocannabinoid anandamide and the phytocannabinoid cannabidiol, against oxidative stress and the toxic hallmark Alzheimer's protein, beta-amyloid (Abeta) in neuronal cell lines. PC12 or SH-SY5Y cells were selectively exposed to either hydrogen peroxide, tert-butyl hydroperoxide or Abeta, alone or in the presence of the CB1 specific agonist arachidonyl-2'-chloroethylamide (ACEA), CB2 specific agonist JWH-015, anandamide or cannabidiol. Cannabidiol improved cell viability in response to tert-butyl hydroperoxide in PC12 and SH-SY5Y cells, while hydrogen peroxide-mediated toxicity was unaffected by cannabidiol pretreatment. Abeta exposure evoked a loss of cell viability in PC12 cells. Of the cannabinoids tested, only anandamide was able to inhibit Abeta-evoked neurotoxicity. ACEA had no effect on Abeta-evoked neurotoxicity, suggesting a CB1 receptor-independent effect of anandamide. JWH-015 pretreatment was also without protective influence on PC12 cells from either pro-oxidant or Abeta exposure. None of the cannabinoids directly inhibited or disrupted preformed Abeta fibrils and aggregates. In conclusion, the endocannabinoid anandamide protects neuronal cells from Abeta exposure via a pathway unrelated to CB1 or CB2 receptor activation. The protective effect of cannabidiol against oxidative stress does not confer protection against Abeta exposure, suggesting divergent pathways for neuroprotection of these two cannabinoids.

22233766|t|Injury markers but not amyloid markers are associated with rapid progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia in Alzheimer's disease.
22233766|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common cause of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, the time between the diagnosis of MCI and the diagnosis of dementia is highly variable. In this study we investigated which known risk factors and biomarkers of AD pathology were associated with rapid progression from MCI to dementia. Of the 203 subjects with MCI, 91 progressed to AD-type dementia and were considered to have MCI-AD at baseline. Subjects with MCI-AD were older, more frequently female and carrier of the APOE-epsilon4 allele, had lower scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), more medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) and lower levels of Abeta1-42 and increased levels of t-tau and p-tau in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compared to subjects without AD-type dementia at follow up. Of the 91 subjects with MCI-AD, we had data available of CSF (n = 56), MTA (n = 76), and APOE-genotype (n = 63). Among the subjects with MCI-AD, MTA (hazard ratio (HR) 2.2, p = 0.004) and low MMSE score (HR 2.0 p = 0.007) were associated with rapid progression to dementia. High CSF t-tau (HR 1.7, p = 0.07) and p-tau (1.7, p = 0.08) tended to be associated with rapid progression to dementia. CSF Abeta1-42, APOE status, age, gender, and educational level were not associated with time to dementia. Our findings implicate a different role for biomarkers in diagnosis and prognosis of MCI-AD. While amyloid markers can be used to identify MCI-AD, injury markers may predict rapid progression to dementia.

22234334|t|Cerebral microinfarcts: a systematic review of neuropathological studies.
22234334|a|Vascular cognitive impairment is an umbrella term for cognitive dysfunction associated with and presumed to be caused by vascular brain damage. Autopsy studies have identified microinfarcts as an important neuropathological correlate of vascular cognitive impairment that escapes detection by conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). As a frame of reference for future high-resolution MRI studies, we systematically reviewed the literature on neuropathological studies on cerebral microinfarcts in the context of vascular disease, vascular risk factors, cognitive decline and dementia. We identified 32 original patient studies involving 10,515 people. The overall picture is that microinfarcts are common, particularly in patients with vascular dementia (weighted average 62%), Alzheimer's disease (43%), and demented patients with both Alzheimer-type and cerebrovascular pathology (33%) compared with nondemented older individuals (24%). In many patients, multiple microinfarcts were detected. Microinfarcts are described as minute foci with neuronal loss, gliosis, pallor, or more cystic lesions. They are found in all brain regions, possibly more so in the cerebral cortex, particularly in watershed areas. Reported sizes vary from 50 mum to a few mm, which is within the detection limit of current high-resolution MRI. Detection of these lesions in vivo would have a high potential for future pathophysiological studies in vascular cognitive impairment.

22235132|t|Amyloid-beta oligomers induce differential gene expression in adult human brain slices.
22235132|a|Cognitive decline in Alzheimer disease (AD) is increasingly attributed to the neuronal impact of soluble oligomers of the amyloid-beta peptide (AbetaOs). Current knowledge on the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the toxicity of AbetaOs stems largely from rodent-derived cell/tissue culture experiments or from transgenic models of AD, which do not necessarily recapitulate the complexity of the human disease. Here, we used DNA microarray and RT-PCR to investigate changes in transcription in adult human cortical slices exposed to sublethal doses of AbetaOs. The results revealed a set of 27 genes that showed consistent differential expression upon exposure of slices from three different donors to AbetaOs. Functional classification of differentially expressed genes revealed that AbetaOs impact pathways important for neuronal physiology and known to be dysregulated in AD, including vesicle trafficking, cell adhesion, actin cytoskeleton dynamics, and insulin signaling. Most genes (70%) were down-regulated by AbetaO treatment, suggesting a predominantly inhibitory effect on the corresponding pathways. Significantly, AbetaOs induced down-regulation of synaptophysin, a presynaptic vesicle membrane protein, suggesting a mechanism by which oligomers cause synapse failure. The results provide insight into early mechanisms of pathogenesis of AD and suggest that the neuronal pathways affected by AbetaOs may be targets for the development of novel diagnostic or therapeutic approaches.

22236086|t|Synthesis and evaluation of 18F-labeled styryltriazole and resveratrol derivatives for beta-amyloid plaque imaging.
22236086|a|In the present study, a styryltriazole and four resveratrol derivatives were synthesized as candidates for beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaque imaging. On the basis of their binding affinities to Abeta(1-42) aggregates, the styryltriazole (1, K(i) = 12.8 nM) and one resveratrol derivative (5, K(i) = 0.49 nM) were labeled with (18)F. In normal mice, tissue distribution of [(18)F]5 showed good initial brain uptake (3.26% ID/g at 2 min) but slow wash-out from brains (2-to-60 min uptake ratio: 2.9). Furthermore, it underwent in vivo metabolic defluorination (1.88% ID/g at 2 min and 9.73% ID/g at 60 min). In contrast, [(18)F]1 displayed high initial brain uptake (5.38% ID/g at 2 min) with rapid wash-out from brains (0.52% ID/g at 60 min; 2-to-60 min uptake ratio: 10.3). These results indicate that [(18)F]1 has in vivo kinetics comparable to PET radiopharmaceuticals currently under commercial development, demonstrating that [(18)F]1 is a desirable PET radioligand for Abeta plaque imaging.

22236100|t|Membrane recruitment of autophagy proteins in selective autophagy.
22236100|a|Autophagy is a stress response that is upregulated in response to signals such as starvation, growth factor deprivation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and pathogen infection. Defects in this pathway are the underlying cause of a number of diseases, including metabolic aberrations, infectious diseases, and cancer, which are closely related to hepatic disorders. To date, more than 30 human ATG (autophagy) genes have been reported to regulate autophagosome formation. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of how ATG proteins behave during autophagosome formation in both non-selective and selective autophagy.

22236802|t|Memantine for dementia in adults older than 40 years with Down's syndrome (MEADOWS): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
22236802|a|BACKGROUND: Prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in people with Down's syndrome is very high, and many such individuals who are older than 40 years have pathological changes characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. Evidence to support treatment with Alzheimer's drugs is inadequate, although memantine is beneficial in transgenic mice. We aimed to assess safety and efficacy of memantine on cognition and function in individuals with Down's syndrome. METHODS: In our prospective randomised double-blind trial, we enrolled adults (>40 years) with karyotypic or clinically diagnosed Down's syndrome, with and without dementia, at four learning disability centres in the UK and Norway. We randomly allocated participants (1:1) to receive memantine or placebo for 52 weeks by use of a computer-generated sequence and a minimisation algorithm to ensure balanced allocation for five prognostic factors (sex, dementia, age group, total Down's syndrome attention, memory, and executive function scales [DAMES] score, and centre). The primary outcome was change in cognition and function, measured with DAMES scores and the adaptive behaviour scale (ABS) parts I and II. We analysed differences in DAMES and ABS scores between groups with analyses of covariance or quantile regression in all patients who completed the 52 week assessment and had available follow-up data. This study is registered, number ISRCTN47562898. FINDINGS: We randomly allocated 88 patients to receive memantine (72 [82%] had DAMES data and 75 [85%] had ABS data at 52 weeks) and 85 to receive placebo (74 [87%] and 73 [86%]). Both groups declined in cognition and function but rates did not differ between groups for any outcomes. After adjustment for baseline score, there were non-significant differences between groups of -4 1 (95% CI -13 1 to 4 8) in DAMES scores, -8 5 (-20 1 to 3 1) in ABS I scores, and 2 0 (-7 2 to 11 3) in ABS II scores, all in favour of controls. 10 (11%) of 88 participants in the memantine group and six (7%) of 85 controls had serious adverse events (p=0 33). Five participants in the memantine group and four controls died from serious adverse events (p=0 77). INTERPRETATION: There is a striking absence of evidence about pharmacological treatment of cognitive impairment and dementia in people older than 40 years with Down's syndrome. Despite promising indications, memantine is not an effective treatment. Therapies that are effective for Alzheimer's disease are not necessarily effective in this group of patients.

22238323|t|Abeta delays fibrin clot lysis by altering fibrin structure and attenuating plasminogen binding to fibrin.
22238323|a|Alzheimer disease is characterized by the presence of increased levels of the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) in the brain parenchyma and cerebral blood vessels. This accumulated Abeta can bind to fibrin(ogen) and render fibrin clots more resistant to degradation. Here, we demonstrate that Abeta(42) specifically binds to fibrin and induces a tighter fibrin network characterized by thinner fibers and increased resistance to lysis. However, Abeta(42)-induced structural changes cannot be the sole mechanism of delayed lysis because Abeta overlaid on normal preformed clots also binds to fibrin and delays lysis without altering clot structure. In this regard, we show that Abeta interferes with the binding of plasminogen to fibrin, which could impair plasmin generation and fibrin degradation. Indeed, plasmin generation by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), but not streptokinase, is slowed in fibrin clots containing Abeta(42), and clot lysis by plasmin, but not trypsin, is delayed. Notably, plasmin and tPA activities, as well as tPA-dependent generation of plasmin in solution, are not decreased in the presence of Abeta(42). Our results indicate the existence of 2 mechanisms of Abeta(42) involvement in delayed fibrinolysis: (1) through the induction of a tighter fibrin network composed of thinner fibers, and (2) through inhibition of plasmin(ogen)-fibrin binding.

22241730|t|beta-Amyloid peptide is internalized into chick retinal neurons and alters the distribution of myosin Vb.
22241730|a|The most common neurodegenerative disorder afflicting the aging human population is Alzheimer's disease (AD). A major hallmark of AD is dementia from a loss of neuronal function, attributed to the presence and accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide into senile plaques. Preceding senile plaque formation, abnormalities in axons can be observed as changes in morphologies and intracellular trafficking. Recently, it has been recognized that Abeta also accumulates within neurons and this intraneuronal Abeta accumulation has been reported to be critical in the disruption of synapses and cognitive function. Here, we report on the internalization of a fluorescently labeled Abeta peptide into cultured chick retinal neurons. The pattern of Abeta distribution during the time course of incubation is reminiscent of the endocytic pathway. Furthermore, the distribution of the internalized Abeta peptide converges with that of myosin Vb and both relocalize from the axon to cell body. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that AD proceeds as a result of an imbalance between Abeta production and Abeta clearance, suggesting a role for myosin Vb in this process.

22242635|t|Probing structural features of Alzheimer's amyloid-beta pores in bilayers using site-specific amino acid substitutions.
22242635|a|A current hypothesis for the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) proposes that amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides induce uncontrolled, neurotoxic ion flux across cellular membranes. The mechanism of ion flux is not fully understood because no experiment-based Abeta channel structures at atomic resolution are currently available (only a few polymorphic states have been predicted by computational models). Structural models and experimental evidence lend support to the view that the Abeta channel is an assembly of loosely associated mobile beta-sheet subunits. Here, using planar lipid bilayers and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we show that amino acid substitutions can be used to infer which residues are essential for channel structure. We created two Abeta(1-42) peptides with point mutations: F19P and F20C. The substitution of Phe19 with Pro inhibited channel conductance. MD simulation suggests a collapsed pore of F19P channels at the lower bilayer leaflet. The kinks at the Pro residues in the pore-lining beta-strands induce blockage of the solvated pore by the N-termini of the chains. The cysteine mutant is capable of forming channels, and the conductance behavior of F20C channels is similar to that of the wild type. Overall, the mutational analysis of the channel activity performed in this work tests the proposition that the channels consist of a beta-sheet rich organization, with the charged/polar central strand containing the mutation sites lining the pore, and the C-terminal strands facing the hydrophobic lipid tails. A detailed understanding of channel formation and its structure should aid studies of drug design aiming to control unregulated Abeta-dependent ion fluxes.

22244942|t|Substance P activates ADAM9 mRNA expression and induces alpha-secretase-mediated amyloid precursor protein cleavage.
22244942|a|Altered levels of Substance P (SP), a neuropeptide endowed with neuroprotective and anti-apoptotic properties, were found in brain areas and spinal fluid of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. One of the hallmarks of AD is the abnormal extracellular deposition of neurotoxic beta amyloid (Abeta) peptides, derived from the proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). In the present study, we confirmed, the neurotrophic action of SP in cultured rat cerebellar granule cells (CGCs) and investigated its effects on APP metabolism. Incubation with low (5 mM) potassium induced apoptotic cell death of CGCs and amyloidogenic processing of APP, whereas treatment with SP (200 nM) reverted these effects via NK1 receptors. The non-amyloidogenic effect of SP consisted of reduction of Abeta(1-42), increase of sAPPalpha and enhanced alpha-secretase activity, without a significant change in steady-state levels of cellular APP. The intracellular mechanisms whereby SP alters APP metabolism were further investigated by measuring mRNA and/or steady-state protein levels of key enzymes involved with alpha-, beta- and gamma-secretase activity. Among them, Adam9, both at the mRNA and protein level, was the only enzyme to be significantly down-regulated following the induction of apoptosis (K5) and up-regulated after SP treatment. In addition to its neuroprotective properties, this study shows that SP is able to stimulate non-amyloidogenic APP processing, thereby reducing the possibility of generation of toxic Abeta peptides in brain.

22245578|t|Metal binding dictates conformation and function of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) E2 domain.
22245578|a|The amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its neurotoxic cleavage product Abeta are key players in the development of Alzheimer's disease and appear essential for neuronal development and cell homeostasis in mammals. Proteolytic processing of APP is influenced by metal ions, protein ligands and its oligomerization state. However, the structural basis and functional mechanism of APP regulation are hitherto largely unknown. Here we identified a metal-dependent molecular switch located within the E2 domain of APP containing four evolutionary highly conserved histidine residues. Three X-ray structures of the metal-bound molecule were solved at 2.6-2.0 A resolution. Using protein crystallographic and biochemical methods, we characterized this novel high-affinity binding site within the E2 domain that binds competitively to copper and zinc at physiological concentrations. Metal-specific coordination spheres induce large conformational changes and enforce distinct structural states, most likely regulating the physiological function of APP and its processing in Alzheimer's disease.

22248010|a|The aim of this study was to validate the CogState Brief Battery, which assesses psychomotor, attentional, working memory, and visual learning functions, in healthy older people and in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), enrolled in the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study. In healthy older adults, weak relationships between demographic variables (e.g., education, depression) and cognitive performance were observed. In AD and MCI groups, the magnitude of impairment was greatest for tasks of working memory and memory, with a negative influence of apolipoprotein E epsilon4 status on learning but not working memory. These results suggest that the CogState Brief Battery can be used to screen for AD-related cognitive changes.

22248233|t|The anti-neurodegenerative agent clioquinol regulates the transcription factor FOXO1a.
22248233|a|Many diseases of aging including AD (Alzheimer's disease) and T2D (Type 2 diabetes) are strongly associated with common risk factors, suggesting that there may be shared aging mechanisms underlying these diseases, with the scope to identify common cellular targets for therapy. In the present study we have examined the insulin-like signalling properties of an experimental AD 8-hydroxyquinoline drug known as CQ (clioquinol). The IIS [insulin/IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor-1) signalling] kinase Akt/PKB (protein kinase B) inhibits the transcription factor FOXO1a (forkhead box O1a) by phosphorylating it on residues that trigger its exit from the nucleus. In HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 cells, we found that CQ treatment induces similar responses. A key transcriptional response to IIS is the inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression, and, in rat liver cells, CQ represses expression of the key gluconeogenic regulatory enzymes PEPCK (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) and G6Pase (glucose-6-phosphatase). The effects on FOXO1a and gluconeogenic gene expression require the presence of Zn2+ ions, reminiscent of much earlier studies examining diabetogenic properties of 8-hydroxyquinolines. Comparative investigation of the signalling properties of a panel of these compounds demonstrates that CQ alone exhibits FOXO1a regulation without diabetogenicity. Our results suggest that Zn2+-dependent regulation of FOXOs and gluconeogenesis may contribute to the therapeutic properties of this drug. Further investigation of this signalling response might illuminate novel pharmacological strategies for the treatment of age-related diseases.

22249135|t|Prolonged elevation in hippocampal Abeta and cognitive deficits following repeated endotoxin exposure in the mouse.
22249135|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by neuronal cell death and atrophy in regions of the adult brain, including the hippocampus and cortex, due to formation of amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The presence of these pathologies can limit normal signaling properties and ultimately lead to learning and memory deficits. Chronic inflammation has been implicated in the onset and progression of these AD-related pathologies. Our study was designed to assess the effects of peripheral inflammation on pathologies associated with AD by using the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS). C57BL/6J mice were given intraperitoneal injections of LPS or saline for 1, 3, or 7 consecutive days. Hippocampal tissue from animals receiving LPS contained significantly higher levels of Abeta1-42, a peptide component of AD plaques, than did those from saline control animals. Central and peripheral pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were increased following a single injection of LPS, but retuned to baseline levels before cognitive testing began. We show that one injection of LPS leads to sickness behavior, but 7 consecutive days does not, indicating tolerance to the endotoxin. Cognitive testing was then conducted to determine if whether deficits from increased Abeta1-42 was evident. Results from both Morris water maze and contextual fear conditioning revealed cognitive deficits in LPS-treated mice. In summary, multiple injections of LPS resulted in increased Abeta1-42 in the hippocampus and cognitive deficits in mice.

22252710|t|Sendai virus vector-mediated brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression ameliorates memory deficits and synaptic degeneration in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
22252710|a|Growing evidence suggests that decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Therefore, BDNF gene therapy is considered to be a promising therapeutic strategy for treating AD. Sendai virus (SeV) is a type I parainfluenza virus that does not interact with host chromosomes because of its strict cytoplasmic life cycle. Although SeV is nonpathogenic in primates, including humans, its infectivity for neurons is strong. Here we demonstrate that SeV vectors effectively infected neurons, even though they were injected into subcortical white matter. Moreover, SeV vectors significantly induced BDNF expression, ameliorating synaptic degeneration and memory deficits in a transgenic mouse model of AD (Tg2576). This is the first study to demonstrate that viral vector administration in white matter is sufficient to restore cognitive function in vivo. These results also support the feasibility of using SeV vectors for gene therapy targeting the brain.

22252785|t|The microtubule-associated protein 1A (MAP1A) is an early molecular target of soluble Abeta-peptide.
22252785|a|A progressive accumulation of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) is widely recognized as a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Substantial progress has been made toward understanding the neurodegenerative cascade initiated by small soluble species of Abeta and recent evidence supports the notion that microtubule rearrangements may be proximate to neuritic degeneration and deficits in episodic declarative memory. Here, we examined primary cortical neurons for changes in markers associated with synaptic function following exposure to sublethal concentrations of non-aggregated Abeta-peptide. This data show that soluble Abeta species at a sublethal concentration induce degradation of the microtubule-associated protein 1A (MAP1A) without concurrently affecting dendritic marker MAP2 and/or the pre-synaptic marker synaptophysin. In addition, MAP1A was found to highly co-localize with the postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) protein, proposing that microtubule perturbations might be central for the Abeta-induced neuronal dysfunctions as PSD-95 plays a key role in synaptic plasticity. In conclusion, this study suggests that disruption of MAP1A could be a very early manifestation of Abeta-mediated synaptic dysfunction-one that presages the clinical onset of AD by years. Moreover, our data support the notion of microtubule-stabilizing agents as effective AD drugs.

22253440|t|Z-Phe-Ala-diazomethylketone (PADK) disrupts and remodels early oligomer states of the Alzheimer disease Abeta42 protein.
22253440|a|The oligomerization of the amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) is an important event in Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology. Developing small molecules that disrupt formation of early oligomeric states of Abeta and thereby reduce the effective amount of toxic oligomers is a promising therapeutic strategy for AD. Here, mass spectrometry and ion mobility spectrometry were used to investigate the effects of a small molecule, Z-Phe-Ala-diazomethylketone (PADK), on the Abeta42 form of the protein. The mass spectrum of a mixture of PADK and Abeta42 clearly shows that PADK binds directly to Abeta42 monomers and small oligomers. Ion mobility results indicate that PADK not only inhibits the formation of Abeta42 dodecamers, but also removes preformed Abeta42 dodecamers from the solution. Electron microscopy images show that PADK inhibits Abeta42 fibril formation in the solution. These results are consistent with a previous study that found that PADK has protective effects in an AD transgenic mouse model. The study of PADK and Abeta42 provides an example of small molecule therapeutic development for AD and other amyloid diseases.

22258116|t|Platelet immunoglobulin and amyloid precursor protein as potential peripheral biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease: findings from a pilot study.
22258116|a|BACKGROUND: the diagnosis of dementia, in particular Alzheimer's disease (AD), is enhanced with the use of molecular biomarkers. Since cerebrospinal fluid analysis and molecular neuroimaging are not routinely used in many countries, blood biomarker molecules may be more readily applicable in a routine clinical setting. METHODS: twenty-five subjects with a clinical diagnosis of AD and 26 control participants were assessed for cognitive and behavioural functioning. Platelet measures of amyloid protein precursor (APP), tau protein, clusterin, alpha-synuclein and immunoglobulin (Ig) were measured. Linear regression analysis for platelet proteins and cognitive and behavioural status were determined, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves created to assess the discriminating power of each biochemical parameter between AD and control groups. RESULTS: both AD and control subjects had similar platelet levels of measures platelet proteins, with the exception of slightly elevated Ig levels in AD subjects (P = 0.052). The latter were not related to increasing age, or extent of cognitive impairment. APP-N measures were negatively correlated with cognitive scores. CONCLUSION: these preliminary findings suggest that platelet measures of the traditional biomarkers for AD are feasible in the periphery. The measures of platelet APP-N and Ig, in particular, merit further study in a larger cohort of AD and control subjects.

22258515|t|Hormesis and amyloid-beta protein: physiology or pathology?
22258515|a|Hormesis is the concept that low doses of a toxin can have beneficial effects while high doses are harmful. This is also known as the inverted-U shaped dose-response curve. Hormesis appears to be a universal law for the function of memory mimetics. Amyloid-beta protein is widely recognized to be a toxic agent responsible for plaque formation in Alzheimer's disease. In high doses it also produces amnesia. In lower, physiological doses, it enhances long term potentiation and memory. Blocking amyloid-beta protein in animals without overproduction of the protein results in amnesia. At low doses, amyloid-beta also increases neurite outgrowth, produces presynaptic enhancement, and may quench oxidative damage. It is postulated that both over- and underproduction of amyloid-beta can lead to memory deficits. This is similar to a number of hormonal diseases, e.g., thyroid, where both low and high levels produce disease.

22260232|t|Brain insulin resistance accelerates Abeta fibrillogenesis by inducing GM1 ganglioside clustering in the presynaptic membranes.
22260232|a|Type 2 diabetes mellitus is thought to be a significant risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Insulin resistance also affects the central nervous system by regulating key processes, such as neuronal survival and longevity, learning and memory. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain uncertain. To investigate whether insulin resistance is associated with the assembly of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) at the cell surface of neurons, we inhibited insulin-signalling pathways of primary neurons. The treatments of insulin receptor (IR)-knockdown and a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor (LY294002), but not an extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitor, induced an increase in GM1 ganglioside (GM1) levels in detergent-resistant membrane microdomains of the neurons. The aged db/db mouse brain exhibited reduction in IR expression and phosphorylation of Akt, which later induced an increase in the high-density GM1-clusters on synaptosomes. Neurons treated with IR knockdown or LY294002, and synaptosomes of the aged db/db mouse brains markedly accelerated an assembly of Abetas. These results suggest that ageing and peripheral insulin resistance induce brain insulin resistance, which accelerates the assembly of Abetas by increasing and clustering of GM1 in detergent-resistant membrane microdomains of neuronal membranes.

22261520|t|Differential diagnosis in Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies via VMAT2 and amyloid imaging.
22261520|a|BACKGROUND: The noninvasive evaluation of nigrostriatal dopaminergic integrity by PET can provide useful information for the differential diagnosis between dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the diagnostic potential of imaging striatal monoaminergic terminal integrity with the novel vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) radioligand [(18)F]AV-133 and PET to distinguish DLB from AD. METHODS: Fifty participants [9 DLB, 11 AD, 20 Parkinson's disease (PD) and 10 healthy age-matched control subjects (HC)] underwent [(18)F]AV-133 PET studies. Additionally, 20 participants underwent amyloid imaging PET scans with either [(11)C]PiB or (18)F-florbetaben. VMAT2 density was calculated through normalized tissue uptake value ratios (R(T)) at 120-140 min after injection using the primary visual or the cerebellar cortex as reference region. Comparison of the R(T) for [(18)F]AV-133 was done between the different clinical diagnostic groups. RESULTS: Significantly lower striatal VMAT2 densities were observed in DLB and PD when compared to AD and HC, especially in the posterior putamen. In contrast to PD and DLB, no reductions were observed in AD patients when compared to HC. CONCLUSIONS: [(18)F]AV-133 allows assessment of nigrostriatal degeneration in Lewy body diseases. In contrast to amyloid imaging, VMAT2 imaging with [(18)F]AV-133 can robustly detect reductions of dopaminergic nigrostriatal afferents in DLB patients, assisting in the differential diagnosis from AD.

22261556|t|Toward a multifactorial model of Alzheimer disease.
22261556|a|Relations among antecedent biomarkers of Alzheimer disease (AD) were evaluated using causal modeling; although correlation cannot be equated to causation, causation does require correlation. Individuals aged 43 to 89 years (N = 220) enrolled as cognitively normal controls in longitudinal studies had clinical and psychometric assessment, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, and brain amyloid imaging via positron emission tomography with Pittsburgh Compound B (PIB) obtained within 1 year. CSF levels of Abeta(42) and tau were minimally correlated, indicating they represent independent processes. Abeta(42), tau, and their interaction explained 60% of the variance in PIB. Effects of APOE genotype and age on PIB were indirect, operating through CSF markers. Only spurious relations via their common relation with age were found between the biomarkers and regional brain volumes or cognition. Hence, at least 2 independent hypothesized processes, one reflected by CSF Abeta(42) and one by CSF tau, contribute to the development of fibrillar amyloid plaques preclinically. The lack of correlation between these 2 processes and brain volume in the regions most often affected in AD suggests the operation of a third process related to brain atrophy.

22262260|t|Differential cell proliferation in the cortex of the APPswePS1dE9 Alzheimer's disease mouse model.
22262260|a|Plaque deposition in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known to decrease proliferation in neurogenic niches in AD mouse models, but the effects on cell proliferation and differentiation in other brain areas have not been studied in detail. We analyzed cell proliferation in the cortex of wild type (WT) and APPswePS1dE9 transgenic (AD) mice at different ages. Mice were studied shortly after the last BrdU injection (BrdU[ST]). In AD mice, the number of proliferating cells increased fourfold, coinciding with plaque appearance and its associated reactive gliosis and activation of microglia. An increase in the number of BrdU[ST]-cells expressing markers for activated microglia is underlying the enhanced proliferation. Cortical reactive astrocytes did not become proliferative since BrdU[ST]-cells were negative for different astrocyte-specific markers. The number of Olig2-positive oligodendrocyte precursor cells was unchanged. Four weeks after the last BrdU application, the number of BrdU[LT]-cells with an activated microglia signature was still enhanced in AD mice. None of the newborn cells had differentiated into oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, or neurons. On the basis of these observations, we conclude that amyloid plaque deposition increases proliferation of microglia around plaques but does not affect the proliferation of cortical oligodendrocyte precursor cells. No evidence was found for damage-induced proliferation of reactive astrocytes or for a redirected neurogenesis from the subventricular zone. The proliferation of microglia contributes to the rapid accumulation of microglia around plaques and may play a role in limitating plaque expansion.

Although the mechanisms underlying Abeta toxicity remain largely unknown, Abeta fibrils disrupt calcium homeostasis and generate free radicals, resulting in oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptotic cell death. Houttuyniae Herba, the aerial part of Houttuynia cordata Thunb. (Saururaceae), is a commonly used herb in traditional Asian medicine. It has been reported to have various bioactivities, including antioxidant effects. In the present study, we investigated the protective effect of standardised Houttuyniae Herba water extract (HCW) against Abeta(25-35)-induced neurotoxicity and its possible mechanisms in rat primary cortical cells. Pretreatment with HCW attenuated the cell damage caused by 8 muM Abeta(25-35) exposure, as evidenced by a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, a lactate dehydrogenase assay, and microtubule-associated protein 2 immunostaining. Moreover, HCW inhibited the Abeta(25-35)-induced elevation of the intracellular calcium level, reactive oxygen species overproduction, mitochondrial membrane potential disruption, and caspase 3 activation. These results indicate that HCW protects rat primary cortical neurons against Abeta(25-35)-induced toxicity via the regulation of calcium and the inhibition of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis.

22262751|t|Genetic variation at CR1 increases risk of cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
22262751|a|OBJECTIVE: Accumulated evidence suggests that a variant within the CR1 gene (single nucleotide polymorphism rs6656401), known to increase risk for Alzheimer disease (AD), influences beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition in brain tissue. Given the biologic overlap between AD and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), a leading cause of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in elderly individuals, we investigated whether rs6656401 increases the risk of CAA-related ICH and influences vascular Abeta deposition. METHODS: We performed a case-control genetic association study of 89 individuals with CAA-related ICH and 280 individuals with ICH unrelated to CAA and compared them with 324 ICH-free control subjects. We also investigated the effect of rs6656401 on risk of recurrent CAA-ICH in a prospective longitudinal cohort of ICH survivors. Finally, association with severity of histopathologic CAA was investigated in 544 autopsy specimens from 2 longitudinal studies of aging. RESULTS: rs6656401 was associated with CAA-ICH (odds ratio [OR] = 1.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19-2.17, p = 8.0 x 10(-4)) as well as with risk of recurrent CAA-ICH (hazard ratio = 1.35, 95% CI 1.04-1.76, p = 0.024). Genotype at rs6656401 was also associated with severity of CAA pathology at autopsy (OR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.05-1.71, p = 0.009). Adjustment for parenchymal amyloid burden did not cancel this effect, suggesting that, despite the correlation between parenchymal and vascular amyloid pathology, CR1 acts independently on both processes, thus increasing risk of both AD and CAA. CONCLUSION: The CR1 variant rs6656401 influences risk and recurrence of CAA-ICH, as well as the severity of vascular amyloid deposition.

22265587|t|National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association guidelines for the neuropathologic assessment of Alzheimer's disease.
22265587|a|A consensus panel from the United States and Europe was convened recently to update and revise the 1997 consensus guidelines for the neuropathologic evaluation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other diseases of brain that are common in the elderly. The new guidelines recognize the pre-clinical stage of AD, enhance the assessment of AD to include amyloid accumulation as well as neurofibrillary change and neuritic plaques, establish protocols for the neuropathologic assessment of Lewy body disease, vascular brain injury, hippocampal sclerosis, and TDP-43 inclusions, and recommend standard approaches for the workup of cases and their clinico-pathologic correlation.

22265589|t|Screening and treatment for Alzheimer's disease: predicting population-level outcomes.
22265589|a|BACKGROUND: Advances in screening and treatment are needed to mitigate increasing prevalence of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (DAT). Current proposals to revise Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnostic criteria incorporate diagnostic biomarkers. Such revisions would allow identification of persons with AD pathology before the onset of dementia. The population-level impact of screening for preclinical AD and treating with a disease-modifying agent is important when evaluating new biomarkers and medications. METHODS: A published computer simulation model assigned AD-related event times, such that delays in disease progression due to therapy effectiveness can be estimated for a preclinical AD cohort. Attributes such as screening sensitivity/specificity, treatment efficacy, age at first screening, and rescreening intervals were varied. Outcomes included incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI-AD), incident DAT, and number of patients recommended for treatment. RESULTS: One-time screening at age 65 years, 50% efficacy, and literature-based proxy persistence rates yielded 12.4% incidence of MCI-AD and 0.9% decrease in DAT incidence from base case of no screening/treatment. Modest reductions in incident MCI-AD and DAT were observed with more sensitive testing. Reducing specificity yielded greater reductions in MCI-AD and DAT cases, albeit by treating more patients. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis predicted that for a cohort of patients aged 65 years, the number that needed to be treated to avoid one AD case was 11.6 (range: 5.7-104). CONCLUSION: The reduction in MCI-AD and DAT depends on initial screening age, screening frequency, and specificity. When considering population-level impact of screening-treatment, the effect of these parameters on incidence would need to be weighed against the number of individuals screened and treated.

22266106|t|Amyloid precursor proteins are protective in Drosophila models of progressive neurodegeneration.
22266106|a|The processing of Amyloid Precursor Proteins (APPs) results in several fragments, including soluble N-terminal ectodomains (sAPPs) and C-terminal intracellular domains (AICD). sAPPs have been ascribed neurotrophic or neuroprotective functions in cell culture, although beta-cleaved sAPPs can have deleterious effects and trigger neuronal cell death. Here we describe a neuroproprotective function of APP and fly APPL (Amyloid Precursor Protein-like) in vivo in several Drosophila mutants with progressive neurodegeneration. We show that expression of the N-terminal ectodomain is sufficient to suppress the progressive degeneration in these mutants and that the secretion of the ectodomain is required for this function. In addition, a protective effect is achieved by expressing kuzbanian (which has alpha-secretase activity) whereas expression of fly and human BACE aggravates the phenotypes, suggesting that the protective function is specifically mediated by the alpha-cleaved ectodomain. Furthermore, genetic and molecular studies suggest that the N-terminal fragments interact with full-length APPL activating a downstream signaling pathway via the AICD. Because we show protective effects in mutants that affect different genes (AMP-activated protein kinase, MAP1b, rasGAP), we propose that the protective effect is not due to a genetic interaction between APPL and these genes but a more general aspect of APP proteins. The result that APP proteins and specifically their soluble alpha-cleaved ectodomains can protect against progressive neurodegeneration in vivo provides support for the hypothesis that a disruption of the physiological function of APP could play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease.

22267726|t|Pyroglutamate amyloid beta (Abeta) aggravates behavioral deficits in transgenic amyloid mouse model for Alzheimer disease.
22267726|a|Pyroglutamate-modified Abeta peptides at amino acid position three (Abeta(pE3-42)) are gaining considerable attention as potential key players in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD). Abeta(pE3-42) is abundant in AD brain and has a high aggregation propensity, stability and cellular toxicity. The aim of the present work was to study the direct effect of elevated Abeta(pE3-42) levels on ongoing AD pathology using transgenic mouse models. To this end, we generated a novel mouse model (TBA42) that produces Abeta(pE3-42). TBA42 mice showed age-dependent behavioral deficits and Abeta(pE3-42) accumulation. The Abeta profile of an established AD mouse model, 5XFAD, was characterized using immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. Brains from 5XFAD mice demonstrated a heterogeneous mixture of full-length, N-terminal truncated, and modified Abeta peptides: Abeta(1-42), Abeta(1-40), Abeta(pE3-40), Abeta(pE3-42), Abeta(3-42), Abeta(4-42), and Abeta(5-42). 5XFAD and TBA42 mice were then crossed to generate transgenic FAD42 mice. At 6 months of age, FAD42 mice showed an aggravated behavioral phenotype compared with single transgenic 5XFAD or TBA42 mice. ELISA and plaque load measurements revealed that Abeta(pE3) levels were elevated in FAD42 mice. No change in Abeta(x)(-42) or other Abeta isoforms was discovered by ELISA and mass spectrometry. These observations argue for a seeding effect of Abeta(pE-42) in FAD42 mice.

22267728|t|Phosphorylation of amyloid-beta peptide at serine 8 attenuates its clearance via insulin-degrading and angiotensin-converting enzymes.
22267728|a|Accumulation of amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) in the brain is a common pathological feature of Alzheimer disease (AD). Aggregates of Abeta are neurotoxic and appear to be critically involved in the neurodegeneration during AD pathogenesis. Accumulation of Abeta could be caused by increased production, as indicated by several mutations in the amyloid precursor protein or the gamma-secretase components presenilin-1 and presenilin-2 that cause familial early-onset AD. However, recent data also indicate a decreased clearance rate of Abeta in AD brains. We recently demonstrated that Abeta undergoes phosphorylation by extracellular or cell surface-localized protein kinase A, leading to increased aggregation. Here, we provide evidence that phosphorylation of monomeric Abeta at Ser-8 also decreases its clearance by microglial cells. By using mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that phosphorylation at Ser-8 inhibited the proteolytic degradation of monomeric Abeta by the insulin-degrading enzyme, a major Abeta-degrading enzyme released from microglial cells. Phosphorylation also decreased the degradation of Abeta by the angiotensin-converting enzyme. In contrast, Abeta degradation by plasmin was largely unaffected by phosphorylation. Thus, phosphorylation of Abeta could play a dual role in Abeta metabolism. It decreases its proteolytic clearance and also promotes its aggregation. The inhibition of extracellular Abeta phosphorylation, stimulation of protease expression and/or their proteolytic activity could be explored to promote Abeta degradation in AD therapy or prevention.

22267734|t|Biochemical inhibition of the acetyltransferases ATase1 and ATase2 reduces beta-secretase (BACE1) levels and Abeta generation.
22267734|a|The cellular levels of beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), the rate-limiting enzyme for the generation of the Alzheimer disease (AD) amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta), are tightly regulated by two ER-based acetyl-CoA:lysine acetyltransferases, ATase1 and ATase2. Here we report that both acetyltransferases are expressed in neurons and glial cells, and are up-regulated in the brain of AD patients. We also report the identification of first and second generation compounds that inhibit ATase1/ATase2 and down-regulate the expression levels as well as activity of BACE1. The mechanism of action involves competitive and non-competitive inhibition as well as generation of unstable intermediates of the ATases that undergo degradation.

22269161|t|Intracellular amyloid-beta accumulation in calcium-binding protein-deficient neurons leads to amyloid-beta plaque formation in animal model of Alzheimer's disease.
22269161|a|One of the major hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the extracellular deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) as senile plaques in specific brain regions. Clearly, an understanding of the cellular processes underlying Abeta deposition is a crucial issue in the field of AD research. Recent studies have found that accumulation of intraneuronal Abeta (iAbeta) is associated with synaptic deficits, neuronal death, and cognitive dysfunction in AD patients. In this study, we found that Abeta deposits had several shapes and sizes, and that iAbeta occurred before the formation of extracellular amyloid plaques in the subiculum of 5XFAD mice, an animal model of AD. We also observed pyroglutamate-modified Abeta (N3pE-Abeta), which has been suggested to be a seeding molecule for senile plaques, inside the Abeta plaques only after iAbeta accumulation, which argues against its seeding role. In addition, we found that iAbeta accumulates in calcium-binding protein (CBP)-free neurons, induces neuronal death, and then develops into senile plaques in 2-4-month-old 5XFAD mice. These findings suggest that N3pE-Abeta-independent accumulation of Abeta in CBP-free neurons might be an early process that triggers neuronal damage and senile plaque formation in AD patients. Our results provide new insights into several long-standing gaps in AD research, namely how Abeta plaques are formed, what happens to iAbeta and how Abeta causes selective neuronal loss in AD patients.

22269164|t|Clioquinol reduces zinc accumulation in neuritic plaques and inhibits the amyloidogenic pathway in AbetaPP/PS1 transgenic mouse brain.
22269164|a|Metal dyshomeostasis in the brain helps promote amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, targeting the interactions between metal and Abeta is a potential therapeutic approach for AD. The metal chelator, clioquinol (CQ), is thought to reduce Abeta deposits in the AD transgenic mouse brain, and attenuate the clinical symptoms of AD patients. However, whether oral administration of CQ reduces zinc accumulation in Abeta plaques and inhibits the amyloidogenic pathway have not been properly established in AD transgenic mice. By means of autometallographic analysis, we show for the first time that both the number and size of the zinc-containing plaques were significantly reduced in the brain of amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP)/presenilin 1 (PS1) double transgenic mice treated with CQ (30 mg/kg/day) orally for 2 months. This was accompanied by a reduction in Abeta burden in the CQ-treated mouse brain. Furthermore, CQ treatment markedly reduced the expression levels of AbetaPP protein, the beta-site of AbetaPP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), PS1, and the secreted beta-secretase-derived fragments of AbetaPP (sAbetaPPbeta). The present data indicate that CQ is able to reduce zinc accumulation in the neuritic plaques and inhibit amyloidogenic AbetaPP processing in the AbetaPP/PS1 mouse brain.

22270944|t|Calorimetric investigation of copper(II) binding to Abeta peptides: thermodynamics of coordination plasticity.
22270944|a|Metal ions have been shown to play a critical role in beta-amyloid (Abeta) neurotoxicity, thus prompting an intense investigation into the formation of metal-Abeta complexes. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) has been widely used to determine binding constants (K) for a variety of metal-protein interactions, including those in metal-Abeta complexes. In this study, ITC was used to more fully quantify the thermodynamics (K, DeltaG, DeltaH, and TDeltaS) of Cu(2+) binding to Abeta16, N-acetyl-Abeta16, Abeta28, N-acetyl-Abeta28, and Abeta28 variants (H6A, H13A, H14A) at pH 7.4 and 37  C. After deconvolution of competing reactions, K for Abeta16 was found to be 1.1 (+-0.13) x 10(9) and is in strong agreement with literature values measured under similar conditions. Further, a similar K value was obtained at two additional concentrations of competing ligand, suggesting that ternary complex formation is not significant. The acetylated peptide analogs reveal a marked decrease in the overall free energy upon binding, which is the result of less favorable enthalpic and entropic contributions. Circular dichroism spectroscopy shows conformational changes that are consistent with these results. Most importantly, data for Abeta28 variants lacking a potential Cu(2+)-binding histidine residue reveal that the overall free energy of binding remains constant, which is the result of entropy/enthalpy compensation. These data provide fundamental thermodynamic evidence for coordination plasticity in Cu(2+) binding to Abeta and other intrinsically disordered peptides.

22271100|t|Infrared spectroscopic analysis of mononuclear leukocytes in peripheral blood from Alzheimer's disease patients.
22271100|a|Peripheral mononuclear leukocytes from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients were analyzed by infrared spectroscopy and their spectroscopic properties were compared with those from age-matched healthy controls. Two-dimensional correlation analysis of mean spectra measured at various disease stages shows that the protein secondary structure from AD patients involves beta-sheet enrichment and carbonyl intensity increase relative to healthy controls. The area percentages of beta-sheets, which were obtained by using a peak ratio second-derivative spectral treatment, were used for receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to distinguish between patients with AD and age-matched healthy controls. The critical concentration and area under the curve (AUC) were determined by this curve analysis which showed a good performance for this quantitative assay. The results were 90% sensitivity and 90.5% specificity for determinations involving mild and moderate AD patients, and 82.1% sensitivity and 90.5% specificity for determinations involving patients at the three AD stages (mild, moderate, and severe). The AUC was greater than 0.85 in both scenarios. Taken together these results show that healthy controls are distinguished from mild and moderate AD patients better than from patients with severe disease and suggest that this infrared analysis is a promising strategy for AD diagnostics.

22271153|t|Early AD pathology in a [C-11]PiB-negative case: a PiB-amyloid imaging, biochemical, and immunohistochemical study.
22271153|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposits are detectable in the brain in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET) and [C-11]-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B ([C-11]PiB); however, the sensitivity of this technique is not well understood. In this study, we examined Abeta pathology in an individual who had clinical diagnoses of probable dementia with Lewy bodies and possible Alzheimer's disease (AD) but with no detectable [C-11]PiB PET retention ([C-11]PiB(-)) when imaged 17 months prior to death. Brain samples were processed in parallel with region-matched samples from an individual with a clinical diagnosis of probable AD and a positive [C-11]PiB PET scan ([C-11]PiB(+)) when imaged 10 months prior to death. In the [C-11]PiB(-) case, Abeta plaques were sparse, occupying less than 2% cortical area, and were weakly labeled with 6-CN-PiB, a highly fluorescent derivative of PiB. In contrast, Abeta plaques occupied up to 12% cortical area in the [C-11]PiB(+) case, and were intensely labeled with 6-CN-PIB. The [C-11]PiB(-) case had low levels of [H-3]PiB binding (< 100 pmol/g) and Abeta1-42 (< 500 pmol/g) concentration except in the frontal cortex where Abeta1-42 values (788 pmol/g) approached cortical values in the [C-11]PiB(+) case (800-1, 700 pmol/g). In several cortical regions of the [C-11]PiB(-) case, Abeta1-40 levels were within the range of cortical Abeta1-40 values in the [C-11]PiB(+) case. Antemortem [C-11]PiB DVR values correlated well with region-matched postmortem measures of Abeta1-42 and Abeta1-40 in the [C-11]PiB(+), and with Abeta1-42 only in the [C-11]PiB(-) case. The low ratios of [H-3]PiB binding levels to Abeta concentrations and 6-CN-PiB to Abeta plaque loads in the [C-11]PiB(-) case indicate that Abeta pathology in the brain may be associated with low or undetectable levels of [C-11]PiB retention. Studies in greater numbers of [C-11]PiB PET autopsy cases are needed to define the Abeta concentration and [H-3]PiB binding levels required to produce a positive [C-11]PiB PET signal.

22271235|t|Association of lifetime cognitive engagement and low beta-amyloid deposition.
22271235|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between lifestyle practices (cognitive and physical activity) and beta-amyloid deposition, measured with positron emission tomography using carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B ([(11)C]PiB), in healthy older individuals. DESIGN: Cross-sectional clinical study. SETTING: Berkeley, California. PARTICIPANTS: Volunteer sample of 65 healthy older individuals (mean age, 76.1 years), 10 patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) (mean age, 74.8 years), and 11 young controls (mean age, 24.5 years) were studied from October 31, 2005, to February 22, 2011. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cortical [(11)C]PiB average (frontal, parietal, lateral temporal, and cingulate regions) and retrospective, self-report scales assessing participation in cognitive activities (eg, reading, writing, and playing games) and physical exercise. RESULTS: Greater participation in cognitively stimulating activities across the lifespan, but particularly in early and middle life, was associated with reduced [(11)C]PiB uptake (P<.001, accounting for age, sex, and years of education). Older participants in the highest cognitive activity tertile had [(11)C]PiB uptake comparable to young controls, whereas those in the lowest cognitive activity tertile had [(11)C]PiB uptake comparable to patients with AD. Although greater cognitive activity was associated with greater physical exercise, exercise was not associated with [(11)C]PiB uptake. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with greater early- and middle-life cognitive activity had lower [(11)C]PiB uptake. The tendency to participate in cognitively stimulating activities is likely related to engagement in a variety of lifestyle practices that have been implicated in other studies showing reduced risk of AD-related pathology. We report a direct association between cognitive activity and [(11)C]PiB uptake, suggesting that lifestyle factors found in individuals with high cognitive engagement may prevent or slow deposition of beta-amyloid, perhaps influencing the onset and progression of AD.

22272764|t|Flavonoids protect cerebrovascular endothelial cells through Nrf2 and PI3K from beta-amyloid peptide-induced oxidative damage.
22272764|a|beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta) induced cerebrovascular dysfunction has been recognized as a vital factor involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration. Genistein, a flavonoid, has antioxidative properties to prevent neurodegeneration induced by beta-amyloid peptides. In this study, we were investigating whether genistein could antagonize oxidative damage induced by beta-amyloid peptide 25-35 (Abeta25-35) in bEND.3 cells, and also identifying the potential neuroprotective targets of genistein. Vitamin E was used as the positive control. The bEND.3 cells were pre-incubated with/out genistein or vitamin E for 2 h followed by the incubation with 25 muM A 25-35 for another 24 h. The reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitrotyrosine, cell redox state, mRNA or protein expressions of the factors on Nrf2 signaling pathway were measured after Abeta25-35 treatment. The results showed that genistein alleviated the increase of ROS and nitrotyrosine production induced by Abeta25-35, and maintained bEND.3 cell redox state by increasing GSH level and GSH/GSSG. Genistein could reverse the down-regulation of total protein and mRNA expression of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), nuclear Nrf2, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) induced by Abeta25-35; while PI3K inhibitor LY294002 could attenuate the activation effects of genistein on Nrf2, especially for the promotion of nuclear translocation. These results suggested that genistein could protect cerebrovascular endothelial cells from Abeta25-35-induced oxidative damage. The potential mechanisms might be associated with the activation of Nrf2 signaling pathway by modulating PI3K activity.

22273754|t|Hypercholesterolemia accelerates intraneuronal accumulation of Abeta oligomers resulting in memory impairment in Alzheimer's disease model mice.
22273754|a|AIMS: Hypercholesterolemia is known to be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and diet-induced hypercholesterolemia has been shown to accelerate amyloid pathology in animals. While growing evidence has shown that synaptic and cognitive dysfunction in AD is associated with intraneuronal accumulation of Abeta, the relationships between hypercholesterolemia, memory impairment, and intraneuronal Abeta remains unclear. The present study aims to clarify this association. MAIN METHODS: Transgenic mice expressing amyloid precursor protein (APP) harboring the Osaka (E693 ) mutation (APP(OSK)-Tg mice) were used. These mice exhibit intraneuronal Abeta oligomers and memory impairment from 8months of age. Five-month-old male APP(OSK)-Tg mice and non-Tg littermates were fed a high-cholesterol diet for 1 month to induce hypercholesterolemia. At 6 months of age, their cognitive function was evaluated by the Morris water maze. Intraneuronal Abeta, synaptic density, and tau phosphorylation were examined by immunohistochemistry. KEY FINDINGS: Serum and brain cholesterol levels were significantly higher in APP(OSK)-Tg mice and non-Tg littermates that were fed a high-cholesterol diet than in control mice that were fed normal chow, indicating that hypercholesterolemia was successfully induced. Hypercholesterolemic APP(OSK)-Tg mice, but not control APP(OSK)-Tg mice or hypercholesterolemic non-Tg littermates, exhibited impaired spatial reference memory, which was accompanied with intraneuronal accumulation of Abeta oligomers, reduced synaptophysin immunoreactivity, and abnormal tau phosphorylation in the hippocampus. Hypercholesterolemia-accelerated accumulation of intraneuronal Abeta oligomers was also observed in another model mouse, Tg2576. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggest that hypercholesterolemia accelerates intraneuronal accumulation of Abeta oligomers and subsequent synapse loss, resulting in memory impairment.

22274401|t|The effects of vitamin A supplementation for 3 months on adult rat nigrostriatal axis: increased monoamine oxidase enzyme activity, mitochondrial redox dysfunction, increased beta-amyloid(1-40) peptide and TNF-alpha contents, and susceptibility of mitochondria to an in vitro H2O2 challenge.
22274401|a|Even though vitamin A has been viewed as an antioxidant molecule, recent findings demonstrate that such vitamin elicits pro-oxidant effects in vivo. Moreover, vitamin A supplements utilization may increase mortality rates among healthy subjects. However, the mechanism by which vitamin A elicits such effects remains to be better analyzed. In this regard, we investigated here the consequences of vitamin A supplementation at 500, 1000, or 2500 IU/kg day(-1) for 3 months on adult rat substantia nigra and striatum total and mitochondrial redox state (both oxidative and nitrosative stress markers), electron transfer chain activity, monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzyme activity, endoplasmic reticulum stress marker (BiP), alpha- and beta-synucleins, beta-amyloid peptide (1-40), dopamine D2 receptor (D2R), receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), caspase-3 and caspase-8 enzyme activity and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels. Also, nigrostriatal mitochondria were isolated and challenged with 50 muM H2O2 in vitro after vitamin A supplementation and complexes I-III, II-III, and IV enzyme activity was recorded. We observed both total and mitochondrial oxidative and nitrosative stress, increased MAO enzyme activity, and increased levels of alpha-synuclein, beta-amyloid peptide, RAGE, and TNF-alpha, but decreased D2R in both rat brain areas. Furthermore, vitamin A supplementation induced a decrease in nigral, but not striatal, beta-synuclein levels in this work. Moreover, mitochondria isolated from both substantia nigra and striatum of vitamin A-treated rats were more sensitive to H2O2 than control mitochondria as assessed through the in vitro assay. Overall, these data may be useful to explain how vitamin A elicits neurotoxic effects chronically.

22275252|t|Transcriptional regulation of beta-secretase-1 by 12/15-lipoxygenase results in enhanced amyloidogenesis and cognitive impairments.
22275252|a|OBJECTIVE: 12/15-Lipoxygenase (12/15-LO) is an enzyme widely distributed in the central nervous system, and it has been involved in the neurobiology of Alzheimer disease (AD). However, the mechanism involved remains elusive. METHODS: We investigated the molecular mechanism by which 12/15-LO regulates amyloid beta (Abeta)/Abeta precursor protein (APP) metabolism in vivo and in vitro by genetic and pharmacologic approaches. RESULTS: Here we show that overexpression of 12/15-LO leads to increased levels of beta-secretase-1 (BACE1) mRNA and protein, a significant elevation in Abeta levels and deposition, and a worsening of memory deficits in AD transgenic mice. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that 12/15-LO regulates BACE1 mRNA expression levels via the activation of the transcription factor Sp1. Thus, 12/15-LO-overexpressing mice had elevated levels of Sp1 and BACE1, whereas 12/15-LO-deficient mice had reduced levels of both. Preventing Sp1 activation by pharmacologic inhibition or dominant-negative mutant blocks the 12/15-LO-dependent elevation of Abeta and BACE1 levels. INTERPRETATION: Our findings demonstrate a novel pathway by which 12/15-LO increases the amyloidogenic processing of APP through a Sp1-mediated transcriptional control of BACE1 levels that could have implications for AD pathogenesis and therapy.

22277652|t|Solid-support electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies of Abeta40 monomers reveal a structured state with three ordered segments.
22277652|a|Alzheimer disease is associated with the pathological accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) in the brain. Soluble Abeta oligomers formed during early aggregation process are believed to be neurotoxins and causative agents in Alzheimer disease. Abeta monomer is the building block for amyloid assemblies. A comprehensive understanding of the structural features of Abeta monomer is crucial for delineating the mechanism of Abeta oligomerization. Here we investigated the structures of Abeta40 monomer using a solid-support approach, in which Abeta40 monomers are tethered on the solid support via an N-terminal His tag to prevent further aggregation. EPR spectra of tethered Abeta40 with spin labels at 18 different positions show that Abeta40 monomers adopt a completely disordered structure under denaturing conditions. Under native conditions, however, EPR spectra suggest that Abeta40 monomers adopt both a disordered state and a structured state. The structured state of Abeta40 monomer has three more ordered segments at 14-18, 29-30, and 38-40. Interactions between these segments may stabilize the structured state, which likely plays an important role in Abeta aggregation.

22277654|t|Identification of small molecule inhibitors of neurite loss induced by Abeta peptide using high content screening.
22277654|a|Multiple lines of evidence indicate a strong relationship between Alphabeta peptide-induced neurite degeneration and the progressive loss of cognitive functions in Alzheimer disease (AD) patients and in AD animal models. This prompted us to develop a high content screening assay (HCS) and Neurite Image Quantitator (NeuriteIQ) software to quantify the loss of neuronal projections induced by Abeta peptide neurons and enable us to identify new classes of neurite-protective small molecules, which may represent new leads for AD drug discovery. We identified thirty-six inhibitors of Abeta-induced neurite loss in the 1,040-compound National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) custom collection of known bioactives and FDA approved drugs. Activity clustering showed that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were significantly enriched among the hits. Notably, NSAIDs have previously attracted significant attention as potential drugs for AD; however their mechanism of action remains controversial. Our data revealed that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression was increased following Abeta treatment. Furthermore, multiple distinct classes of COX inhibitors efficiently blocked neurite loss in primary neurons, suggesting that increased COX activity contributes to Abeta peptide-induced neurite loss. Finally, we discovered that the detrimental effect of COX activity on neurite integrity may be mediated through the inhibition of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) activity. Overall, our work establishes the feasibility of identifying small molecule inhibitors of Abeta-induced neurite loss using the NeuriteIQ pipeline and provides novel insights into the mechanisms of neuroprotection by NSAIDs.

22278060|t|Probing sporadic and familial Alzheimer's disease using induced pluripotent stem cells.
22278060|a|Our understanding of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis is currently limited by difficulties in obtaining live neurons from patients and the inability to model the sporadic form of the disease. It may be possible to overcome these challenges by reprogramming primary cells from patients into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Here we reprogrammed primary fibroblasts from two patients with familial Alzheimer's disease, both caused by a duplication of the amyloid-beta precursor protein gene (APP; termed APP(Dp)), two with sporadic Alzheimer's disease (termed sAD1, sAD2) and two non-demented control individuals into iPSC lines. Neurons from differentiated cultures were purified with fluorescence-activated cell sorting and characterized. Purified cultures contained more than 90% neurons, clustered with fetal brain messenger RNA samples by microarray criteria, and could form functional synaptic contacts. Virtually all cells exhibited normal electrophysiological activity. Relative to controls, iPSC-derived, purified neurons from the two APP(Dp) patients and patient sAD2 exhibited significantly higher levels of the pathological markers amyloid-beta(1-40), phospho-tau(Thr 231) and active glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (aGSK-3beta). Neurons from APP(Dp) and sAD2 patients also accumulated large RAB5-positive early endosomes compared to controls. Treatment of purified neurons with beta-secretase inhibitors, but not gamma-secretase inhibitors, caused significant reductions in phospho-Tau(Thr 231) and aGSK-3beta levels. These results suggest a direct relationship between APP proteolytic processing, but not amyloid-beta, in GSK-3beta activation and tau phosphorylation in human neurons. Additionally, we observed that neurons with the genome of one sAD patient exhibited the phenotypes seen in familial Alzheimer's disease samples. More generally, we demonstrate that iPSC technology can be used to observe phenotypes relevant to Alzheimer's disease, even though it can take decades for overt disease to manifest in patients.

22279212|t|Transgenic expression of intraneuronal Abeta42 but not Abeta40 leads to cellular Abeta lesions, degeneration, and functional impairment without typical Alzheimer's disease pathology.
22279212|a|An early role of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) aggregation in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis is well established. However, the contribution of intracellular or extracellular forms of Abeta to the neurodegenerative process is a subject of considerable debate. We here describe transgenic mice expressing Abeta1-40 (APP47) and Abeta1-42 (APP48) with a cleaved signal sequence to insert both peptides during synthesis into the endoplasmic reticulum. Although lower in transgene mRNA, APP48 mice reach a higher brain Abeta concentration. The reduced solubility and increased aggregation of Abeta1-42 may impair its degradation. APP48 mice develop intracellular Abeta lesions in dendrites and lysosomes. The hippocampal neuron number is reduced already at young age. The brain weight decreases during aging in conjunction with severe white matter atrophy. The mice show a motor impairment. Only very few Abeta1-40 lesions are found in APP47 mice. Neither APP47 nor APP48 nor the bigenic mice develop extracellular amyloid plaques. While intracellular membrane expression of Abeta1-42 in APP48 mice does not lead to the AD-typical lesions, Abeta aggregates develop within cells accompanied by considerable neurodegeneration.

22279231|t|Retromer binds the FANSHY sorting motif in SorLA to regulate amyloid precursor protein sorting and processing.
22279231|a|sorLA is a sorting receptor for amyloid precursor protein (APP) genetically linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Retromer, an adaptor complex in the endosome-to-Golgi retrieval pathway, has been implicated in APP transport because retromer deficiency leads to aberrant APP sorting and processing and levels of retromer proteins are altered in AD. Here we report that sorLA and retromer functionally interact in neurons to control trafficking and amyloidogenic processing of APP. We have identified a sequence (FANSHY) in the cytoplasmic domain of sorLA that is recognized by the VPS26 subunit of the retromer complex. Accordingly, we characterized the interaction between the retromer complex and sorLA and determined the role of retromer on sorLA-dependent sorting and processing of APP. Mutations in the VPS26 binding site resulted in receptor redistribution to the endosomal network, similar to the situation seen in cells with VPS26 knockdown. The sorLA mutant retained APP-binding activity but, as opposed to the wild-type receptor, misdirected APP into a distinct non-Golgi compartment, resulting in increased amyloid processing. In conclusion, our data provide a molecular link between reduced retromer expression and increased amyloidogenesis as seen in patients with sporadic AD.

22280020|t|Revealing protein structures in solid-phase peptide synthesis by 13C solid-state NMR: evidence of excessive misfolding for Alzheimer's beta.
22280020|a|Solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) is a widely used technique in biology and chemistry. However, the synthesis yield in SPPS often drops drastically for longer amino acid sequences, presumably because of the occurrence of incomplete coupling reactions. The underlying cause for this problem is hypothesized to be a sequence-dependent propensity to form secondary structures through protein aggregation. However, few methods are available to study the site-specific structure of proteins or long peptides that are anchored to the solid support used in SPPS. This study presents a novel solid-state NMR (SSNMR) approach to examine protein structure in the course of SPPS. As a useful benchmark, we describe the site-specific SSNMR structural characterization of the 40-residue Alzheimer's beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide during SPPS. Our 2D (13)C/(13)C correlation SSNMR data on Abeta(1-40) bound to a resin support demonstrated that Abeta underwent excessive misfolding into a highly ordered beta-strand structure across the entire amino acid sequence during SPPS. This approach is likely to be applicable to a wide range of peptides/proteins bound to the solid support that are synthesized through SPPS.

22283417|t|Characterization of early stage intermediates in the nucleation phase of Abeta aggregation.
22283417|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common form of dementia, which is characterized by the presence of extracellular amyloid plaques comprising the amyloid beta peptide (Abeta). Although the mechanism underlying AD pathogenesis remains elusive, accumulating evidence suggests that the process of amyloid fibril formation is a surface-mediated event, which plays an important role in AD onset and progression. In this study, the mechanism of Abeta aggregation on hydrophobic surfaces was investigated with dual polarization interferometry (DPI), which provides real-time information on early stages of the aggregation process. Aggregation was monitored on a hydrophobic C18 surface and a polar silicon oxynitride surface. The DPI results showed a characteristic Abeta aggregation pattern involving a decrease in the density of Abeta at the surface followed by an increase in the thickness on the hydrophobic C18 chip. Most importantly, the DPI measurements provided unique information on the early stages of Abeta aggregation, which is characterized by the presence of initially slow nucleus formation process followed by exponential fibril elongation. The dimensions of the putative nucleus corresponded to a thickness of ~5 nm for both Abeta40 and Abeta42, which may represent about 10-15 molecules. The results thus support the nucleation-dependent polymerization model as indicated by the presence of a nucleation phase followed by an exponential growth phase. These results are the first reported measurements of the real-time changes in Abeta molecular structure during the early stages of amyloid formation at the nanometer level.

22283439|t|Rapid exchange of metal between Zn(7)-metallothionein-3 and amyloid-beta peptide promotes amyloid-related structural changes.
22283439|a|Metal ions, especially Zn(2+) and Cu(2+), are implemented in the neuropathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by modulating the aggregation of amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta). Also, Cu(2+) may promote AD neurotoxicity through production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Impaired metal ion homeostasis is most likely the underlying cause of aberrant metal-Abeta interaction. Thus, focusing on the body's natural protective mechanisms is an attractive therapeutic strategy for AD. The metalloprotein metallothionein-3 (MT-3) prevents Cu-Abeta-mediated cytotoxicity by a Zn-Cu exchange that terminates ROS production. Key questions about the metal exchange mechanisms remain unanswered, e.g., whether an Abeta-metal-MT-3 complex is formed. We studied the exchange of metal between Abeta and Zn(7)-MT-3 by a combination of spectroscopy (absorption, fluorescence, thioflavin T assay, and nuclear magnetic resonance) and transmission electron microscopy. We found that the metal exchange occurs via free Cu(2+) and that an Abeta-metal-MT-3 complex is not formed. This means that the metal exchange does not require specific recognition between Abeta and Zn(7)-MT-3. Also, we found that the metal exchange caused amyloid-related structural and morphological changes in the resulting Zn-Abeta aggregates. A detailed model of the metal exchange mechanism is presented. This model could potentially be important in developing therapeutics with metal-protein attenuating properties in AD.

22283547|t|Structures of Abeta17-42 trimers in isolation and with five small-molecule drugs using a hierarchical computational procedure.
22283547|a|The amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) oligomers are believed to be the main culprits in the cytoxicity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and p3 peptides (Abeta17-42 fragments) are present in AD amyloid plaques. Many small-molecule or peptide-based inhibitors are known to slow down Abeta aggregation and reduce the toxicity in vitro, but their exact modes of action remain to be determined since there has been no atomic level of Abeta(p3)-drug oligomers. In this study, we have determined the structure of Abeta17-42 trimers both in aqueous solution and in the presence of five small-molecule inhibitors using a multiscale computational study. These inhibitors include 2002-H20, curcumin, EGCG, Nqtrp, and resveratrol. First, we used replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations coupled to the coarse-grained (CG) OPEP force field. These CG simulations reveal that the conformational ensemble of Abeta17-42 trimer can be described by 14 clusters with each peptide essentially adopting turn/random coil configurations, although the most populated cluster is characterized by one peptide with a beta-hairpin at Phe19-Leu31. Second, these 14 dominant clusters and the less-frequent fibril-like state with parallel register of the peptides were subjected to atomistic Autodock simulations. Our analysis reveals that the drugs have multiple binding modes with different binding affinities for trimeric Abeta17-42 although they interact preferentially with the CHC region (residues 17-21). The compounds 2002-H20 and Nqtrp are found to be the worst and best binders, respectively, suggesting that the drugs may interfere at different stages of Abeta oligomerization. Finally, explicit solvent molecular dynamics of two predicted Nqtrp-Abeta17-42 conformations describe at atomic level some possible modes of action for Nqtrp.

However, antiamyloid-based therapies have so far been a failure and, most importantly, growing evidences suggest that Abeta has important physiologic functions. Based on our previous findings demonstrating that low concentrations of Abeta enhanced both synaptic plasticity and memory, whereas high concentrations induced the well-known impairment of cognition, here we show that Abeta acts on hippocampal long-term potentiation and reference memory drawing biphasic dose-response curves. This phenomenon, characterized by low-dose stimulation and high-dose inhibition and represented by a U-shaped or inverted-U-shaped curve, resembles the characteristics of hormesis. The Abeta double role raises important issues on the use of Abeta level reducing agents in Alzheimer's disease.

22285195|t|ApoE: the link between Alzheimer's-related glucose hypometabolism and Abeta deposition?
22285195|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex, multifactorial progressive neurodegenerative disease. Pathologically, AD is characterized by extracellular deposits of amyloid beta (Abeta) protein and intracellular accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of tau. The central role of Abeta protein in the AD etiology is well-established, and its increased deposition in AD brain is attributed to its decreased clearance from the brain. It is noteworthy that apolipoprotein E (ApoE), the most significant risk factor for late-onset AD, has been shown to play a vital role in brain Abeta clearance and the ability of ApoE to do this depends mainly upon its lipidation status. Thus, lower ApoE lipidation status leading to decreased Abeta clearance may underlie the increased Abeta deposition observed in AD brain. In addition to the pathophysiological Abeta deposits, AD is also characterized by certain metabolic changes. Among them, decreased cerebral glucose metabolism is one of the distinct characteristics of AD brain and is also observed in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) who subsequently develop AD. Thus, decreased cerebral glucose metabolism is an early event in AD pathology and may precede the neuropathological Abeta deposition associated with AD. In this context, we hypothesize here that the decreased glucose metabolism in pre-AD and early AD stages, may lead to lower ApoE lipidation status, which in turn may lead to decreased clearance and hence, increased deposition of Abeta protein in AD brain.

22285638|t|Amyloid imaging in dementias with atypical presentation.
22285638|a|BACKGROUND: With the potential emergence of disease specific therapies, an accurate biomarker of Alzheimer's Disease pathology is needed in cases in which the underlying etiology is uncertain. We explored the potential value of amyloid imaging in patients with atypical presentations of dementia. METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with atypical dementia underwent positron emission tomography imaging with the amyloid imaging tracer Pittsburgh compound B (PiB). Twenty-six had [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography scans. After extensive clinical evaluation, this group of patients generated considerable diagnostic uncertainty and received working diagnoses that included possible Alzheimer's disease (AD), focal dementias (e.g., posterior cortical atrophy [PCA]), or cases in which no clear diagnostic category could be determined (dementia of uncertain etiology). Patients were classified as PiB-positive, PiB-negative, or PiB-intermediate, based on objective criteria. Anterior-posterior and left-right indices of PiB and [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake were calculated to examine differences in distribution of amyloid pathology and metabolic changes associated with clinical phenotype. RESULTS: Eleven patients (39%) were PiB positive, 16 were PiB negative (57%), and one (4%) was PiB intermediate. By diagnostic category, three of 10 patients (30%) with dementia of uncertain etiology, one of five (20%) with primary progressive aphasia, three of five (60%) with PCA, and four of seven (57%) with possible AD were PiB positive. Brain metabolism of both PiB-positive and PiB-negative patients was generally similar by phenotype, but appeared to differ from typical AD. PCA patients also appeared to differ in their relative distribution of PiB compared with typical AD, consistent with their atypical phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: AD pathology is frequently present in atypical presentations of dementia and can be identified by amyloid imaging. Clinical phenotype is more related to the pattern of cerebral hypometabolism than the presence/absence of amyloid pathology. These findings have diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications.

22286176|t|The toxic Abeta oligomer and Alzheimer's disease: an emperor in need of clothes.
22286176|a|The 'toxic Abeta oligomer' hypothesis has attracted considerable attention among Alzheimer's disease researchers as a way of resolving the lack of correlation between deposited amyloid-beta (Abeta) in amyloid plaques-in terms of both amount and location-and cognitive impairment or neurodegeneration. However, the lack of a common, agreed-upon experimental description of the toxic Abeta oligomer makes interpretation and direct comparison of data between different research groups impossible. Here we critically review the evidence supporting toxic Abeta oligomers as drivers of neurodegeneration and make some suggestions that might facilitate progress in this complex field.

22287174|t|Stability of amyloid-beta peptides in plasma and serum.
22287174|a|Plasma amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) levels have been suggested as a biomarker candidate for detecting incipient AD. Abeta peptides are known to be sensitive to distinct preanalytical sample handling, which calls for standardised preanalytical procedures. We investigated serum and plasma samples of 19 patients with no clinical signs of dementia for different preanalytical sample handlings. Both serum and plasma were analysed by the one-dimensional Abeta-SDS-PAGE/immunoblot, either immediately or after storage at room temperature for 24 and 48 h, respectively. The panel of Abeta1-37/38/39/40/42 and Abeta2-40 was evaluated. In both analytical matrices, sample storage led to a significant loss of measurable peptide levels. This effect was most pronounced during the first 24 h of storage and stronger in serum than in plasma. There were no significant differences between the distinct analysed Abeta peptide species regarding these results. The ratios of peptides (e.g. Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42/Abeta1-38) displayed a higher stability under the influence of storage than each single peptide. In conclusion, plasma may be more appropriate than serum for analysing Abeta peptides for routine application. At least, the analysis should be done within 24 h and peptide ratios should be created to minimise artificial results.

22288400|t|Transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer disease: developing a better model as a tool for therapeutic interventions.
22288400|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia among elderly. Currently, no effective treatment is available for AD. Analysis of transgenic mouse models of AD has facilitated our understanding of disease mechanisms and provided valuable tools for evaluating potential therapeutic strategies. In this review, we will discuss the strengths and weaknesses of current mouse models of AD and the contribution towards understanding the pathological mechanisms and developing effective therapies.

22288404|t|Natural animal models of neurodegenerative protein misfolding diseases.
22288404|a|Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are some of the most debilitating human illnesses. Research over the past 10 years has provided evidence for a common mechanism of neurodegeneration in which the critical event is the brain accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates. Although it is well established that misfolded proteins play an important role in these diseases, the mechanisms by which they cause cellular and tissue dysfunction are still unknown. To understand the molecular basis of NDs and to develop therapeutic strategies against them, numerous transgenic rodent models have been produced, which reproduce some (but not all) of the features of these diseases. Importantly, some NDs are not exclusive to human beings, such as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Moreover, other diseases which are associated to aging (e.g. Alzheimer's disease) could be studied in aged mammals, which could reproduce the human disease in a more natural way. Although the usefulness of transgenic mice is unquestionable, the information obtained from natural non-transgenic models could be very valuable to fully understand the pathogenesis of these devastating diseases.

22293361|t|Possible involvement of ubiquitin ligase HRD1 insolubilization in amyloid beta generation.
22293361|a|Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) selectively retro-transports and degrades unfolded proteins accumulated in the ER. We have demonstrated that the ubiquitin ligase HRD1 involved in ERAD was significantly decreased in the cerebral cortex of Alzheimer's disease patients. Furthermore, the HRD1 level was negatively correlated with amyloid beta (Abeta) production levels. Here we found that the HRD1 protein level decrease was due to its insolubilization. Moreover, these protein levels extracted from detergent insoluble fraction were positively correlated with those of SEL1L and Abetas (Abeta40 and Abeta42). Thus, the insolubilization-induced decrease in the HRD1 and SEL1L levels might involve in Abeta generation.

22294787|t|Role of RanBP9 on amyloidogenic processing of APP and synaptic protein levels in the mouse brain.
22294787|a|We previously reported that RanBP9 binds low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), amyloid precursor protein (APP), and BACE1 and robustly increased Abeta generation in a variety of cell lines and primary neuronal cultures. To confirm the physiological/ pathological significance of this phenotype in vivo, we successfully generated transgenic mice overexpressing RanBP9 as well as RanBP9-null mice. Here we show that RanBP9 overexpression resulted in >2-fold increase in Abeta40 levels as early as 4 mo of age. A sustained increase in Abeta40 levels was seen at 12 mo of age in both CHAPS-soluble and formic acid (FA)-soluble brain fractions. In addition, Abeta42 levels were also significantly increased in FA-soluble fractions at 12 mo of age. More important, increased Abeta levels were translated to increased deposition of amyloid plaques. In addition, RanBP9 overexpression significantly decreased the levels of synaptophysin and PSD-95 proteins. Conversely, RanBP9-null mice showed increased levels of synaptophysin, PSD-95, and drebrin A protein levels. Given that loss of synapses is the best pathological correlate of cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD), increased Abeta levels by RanBP9 observed in the present study provides compelling evidence that RanBP9 may indeed play a key role in the etiology of AD. If so, RanBP9 provides a great opportunity to develop novel therapy for AD.

22300765|t|Structural properties of EGCG-induced, nontoxic Alzheimer's disease Abeta oligomers.
22300765|a|The green tea compound epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) inhibits Alzheimer's disease beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) neurotoxicity. Solution-state NMR allows probing initial EGCG-Abeta interactions. We show that EGCG-induced Abeta oligomers adopt a well-defined structure and are amenable for magic angle spinning solid-state NMR investigations. We find that EGCG interferes with the aromatic hydrophobic core of Abeta. The C-terminal part of the Abeta peptide (residues 22-39) adopts a beta-sheet conformation, whereas the N-terminus (residues 1-20) is unstructured. The characteristic salt bridge involving residues D23 and K28 is present in the structure of these oligomeric Abeta aggregates as well. The structural analysis of small-molecule-induced amyloid aggregates will open new perspectives for Alzheimer's disease drug development.

22301812|t|Relationship between memory performance and beta-amyloid deposition at different stages of Alzheimer's disease.
22301812|a|BACKGROUND: Postmortem studies have suggested that beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition was only weakly related to the degree of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The development of Abeta ligands for in vivo PET imaging has greatly facilitated the assessment of this question. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to provide an overview of our current knowledge regarding the relationship between Abeta deposition and episodic memory deficits in nondemented elderly and in patients with mild cognitive impairment or AD. METHODS: Information was obtained both from studies comparing memory performance in individuals with high Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) and those with low PiB and from studies performing correlation analyses between memory performance and PiB retention considered as a continuous variable. RESULTS: Previous studies assessing the relationship between memory and global neocortical PiB reported conflicting findings, and overall suggest that this link is weak, probably indirect, and detectable only in early stages. Assessing the relationship with regional instead of global neocortical PiB, we found a specific relationship between episodic memory deficits and neocortical temporal PiB, independent from hippocampal atrophy, in the predementia stage of the disease. CONCLUSION: There is a relationship between regional Abeta deposition and episodic memory deficits in the presymptomatic stage of AD.

22302548|t|Accelerated cortical atrophy in cognitively normal elderly with high beta-amyloid deposition.
22302548|a|OBJECTIVE: Given the recent and growing interest in the concepts of prodromal and presymptomatic Alzheimer disease, it is crucial to determine whether the presence of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in the brain of asymptomatic elderly individuals is a pathologic condition associated with accelerated neuronal and synaptic loss. The aim of the present study was to assess whether Abeta influences the rate of atrophy in cognitively normal elderly individuals. METHODS: Seventy-four healthy elderly individuals underwent an MRI scan and a 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET scan at baseline and a second MRI scan 18 months later. Voxel-wise analyses were performed using maps of annual rate of atrophy generated from the serial MRI scans, including comparison between individuals with high vs low neocortical PiB and correlation with baseline neocortical PiB. RESULTS: The rate of atrophy was significantly higher in the normal elderly individuals with high PiB compared with those with low PiB and was significantly correlated with baseline neocortical PiB, with the highest significance in the temporal neocortex and the posterior cingulate cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that the presence of Abeta in the brain, known to occur in about one-third of asymptomatic elderly individuals, is actually a pathologic state associated with accelerated atrophy. They also suggest that therapy aimed to reduce the neurodegenerative process should be commenced in presymptomatic individuals with high PiB.

22302550|t|beta-Amyloid burden in healthy aging: regional distribution and cognitive consequences.
22302550|a|OBJECTIVE: Several lines of evidence suggest that pathologic changes underlying Alzheimer disease (AD) begin years prior to the clinical expression of the disease, underscoring the need for studies of cognitively healthy adults to capture these early changes. The overall goal of the current study was to map the cortical distribution of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in a healthy adult lifespan sample (aged 30-89), and to assess the relationship between elevated amyloid and cognitive performance across multiple domains. METHODS: A total of 137 well-screened and cognitively normal adults underwent Abeta PET imaging with radiotracer (18)F-florbetapir. Abeta load was estimated from 8 cortical regions. Participants were genotyped for APOE and tested for processing speed, working memory, fluid reasoning, episodic memory, and verbal ability. RESULTS: Abeta deposition is distributed differentially across the cortex and progresses at varying rates with age across cortical brain regions. A subset of cognitively normal adults aged 60 and over show markedly elevated deposition, and also had a higher rate of APOE epsilon4 (38%) than nonelevated adults (19%). Abeta burden was linked to poorer cognitive performance on measures of processing speed, working memory, and reasoning. CONCLUSIONS: Even in a highly selected lifespan sample of adults, Abeta deposition is apparent in some adults and is influenced by APOE status. Greater amyloid burden was related to deleterious effects on cognition, suggesting that subtle cognitive changes accrue as amyloid progresses.

22302554|t|Age and diagnostic performance of Alzheimer disease CSF biomarkers.
22302554|a|OBJECTIVES: Core CSF changes in Alzheimer disease (AD) are decreased amyloid beta(1-42), increased total tau, and increased phospho-tau, probably indicating amyloid plaque accumulation, axonal degeneration, and tangle pathology, respectively. These biomarkers identify AD already at the predementia stage, but their diagnostic performance might be affected by age-dependent increase of AD-type brain pathology in cognitively unaffected elderly. METHODS: We investigated effects of age on the diagnostic performance of CSF biomarkers in a uniquely large multicenter study population, including a cross-sectional cohort of 529 patients with AD dementia (median age 71, range 43-89 years) and 304 controls (67, 44-91 years), and a longitudinal cohort of 750 subjects without dementia with mild cognitive impairment (69, 43-89 years) followed for at least 2 years, or until dementia diagnosis. RESULTS: The specificities for subjects without AD and the areas under the receiver operating characteristics curves decreased with age. However, the positive predictive value for a combination of biomarkers remained stable, while the negative predictive value decreased only slightly in old subjects, as an effect of the high AD prevalence in older ages. CONCLUSION: Although the diagnostic accuracies for AD decreased with age, the predictive values for a combination of biomarkers remained essentially stable. The findings highlight biomarker variability across ages, but support the use of CSF biomarkers for AD even in older populations.

22302812|t|Novel GalphaS-protein signaling associated with membrane-tethered amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain.
22302812|a|Numerous physiological functions, including a role as a cell surface receptor, have been ascribed to Alzheimer's disease-associated amyloid precursor protein (APP). However, detailed analysis of intracellular signaling mediated by APP in neurons has been lacking. Here, we characterized intrinsic signaling associated with membrane-bound APP C-terminal fragments, which are generated following APP ectodomain release by alpha- or beta-secretase cleavage. We found that accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments or expression of membrane-tethered APP intracellular domain results in adenylate cyclase-dependent activation of PKA (protein kinase A) and inhibition of GSK3beta signaling cascades, and enhancement of axodendritic arborization in rat immortalized hippocampal neurons, mouse primary cortical neurons, and mouse neuroblastoma. We discovered an interaction between BBXXB motif of APP intracellular domain and the heterotrimeric G-protein subunit Galpha(S), and demonstrate that Galpha(S) coupling to adenylate cyclase mediates membrane-tethered APP intracellular domain-induced neurite outgrowth. Our study provides clear evidence that APP intracellular domain can have a nontranscriptional role in regulating neurite outgrowth through its membrane association. The novel functional coupling of membrane-bound APP C-terminal fragments with Galpha(S) signaling identified in this study could impact several brain functions such as synaptic plasticity and memory formation.

22303002|t|Sphingolipid-modulated exosome secretion promotes clearance of amyloid-beta by microglia.
22303002|a|Amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta), the pathogenic agent of Alzheimer disease, is a physiological metabolite whose levels are constantly controlled in normal brain. Recent studies have demonstrated that a fraction of extracellular Abeta is associated with exosomes, small membrane vesicles of endosomal origin, although the fate of Abeta in association with exosome is largely unknown. In this study, we identified novel roles for neuron-derived exosomes acting on extracellular Abeta, i.e. exosomes drive conformational changes in Abeta to form nontoxic amyloid fibrils and promote uptake of Abeta by microglia. The Abeta internalized together with exosomes was further transported to lysosomes and degraded. We also found that blockade of phosphatidylserine on the surface of exosomes by annexin V not only prevented exosome uptake but also suppressed Abeta incorporation into microglia. In addition, we demonstrated that secretion of neuron-derived exosomes was modulated by the activities of sphingolipid-metabolizing enzymes, including neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2) and sphingomyelin synthase 2 (SMS2). In transwell experiments, up-regulation of exosome secretion from neuronal cells by treatment with SMS2 siRNA enhanced Abeta uptake into microglial cells and significantly decreased extracellular levels of Abeta. Our findings indicate a novel mechanism responsible for clearance of Abeta through its association with exosomes. The modulation of the vesicle release and/or elimination may alter the risk of AD.

22305339|t|Memory defect induced by beta-amyloid plus glutamate receptor agonist is alleviated by catalpol and donepezil through different mechanisms.
22305339|a|Our previous studies demonstrate that a non-cholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) compound catalpol, purified from a traditional Chinese medicinal herb Rehmannia glutinosa, could improve the symptoms and pathological changes in animal and cellular models of memory related neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we compared catalpol with the most commonly used AChEI donepezil in respect to their mechanism of action on the neurodegenerative changes in an animal model induced by beta-amyloid (Abeta) plus glutamate receptor agonist. It was found that the model mice showed significant deficit in the learning ability and memory in Y maze avoidance test, and meanwhile both donepezil and catalpol greatly improve the learning ability and memory after 2 to 3 months' administration. At the selected doses, donepezil only partially raised the declined brain muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M receptor) density and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity resulting in these levels still lower than normal control, while catalpol completely retrieved these two parameters. ELISA revealed that catalpol, instead of donepezil, possessed the capability of elevating the declined brain BDNF level of the animal model. The ELISA results on the BDNF protein level was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR measurement of BDNF mRNA in Abeta25-35-treated primary culture of forebrain neurons. In combination with our previous work, we think the neuroprotective effects of donepezil and catalpol are mediated through different mechanisms. Since BDNF has been proved to be an important intrinsic factor in protecting neurodegenerative diseases, catalpol may be a hopefully effective compound against neurodegenerative changes induced by Abeta and glutamate receptor agonist.

22305636|t|Binding of beta-amyloid to sulfated sugar residues in a polymer brush.
22305636|a|A glycopolymer obtained by living radical polymerization of glucose-carrying vinyl monomer was sulfated and accumulated as a polymer brush on a gold colloid-immobilized glass. Binding processes of various proteins to sulfated glucose residues in the brush were examined by the increase in absorbance with a help of localized surface plasmon resonance. beta-Amyloid protein (Abeta) bound to the sulfated glycopolymer brush, whereas no binding to the non-sulfated one. An AFM image of Abeta aggregates on the sulfated brush was ellipsoidal, whereas no-shaped aggregation of Abeta on the poly(methacrylic acid) and poly[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate] brushes. The present results indicate the importance of balance between electrostatic attraction and repulsion in the folding-aggregation phenomena of Abeta at the surface of glycopolymers.

22305802|t|Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities in patients with Alzheimer's disease treated with bapineuzumab: a retrospective analysis.
22305802|a|BACKGROUND: Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) have been reported in patients with Alzheimer's disease treated with bapineuzumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody against amyloid beta. ARIA include MRI signal abnormalities suggestive of vasogenic oedema and sulcal effusions (ARIA-E) and microhaemorrhages and haemosiderin deposits (ARIA-H). Our aim was to investigate the incidence of ARIA during treatment with bapineuzumab, and evaluate associated risk factors. METHODS: Two neuroradiologists independently reviewed 2572 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI scans from 262 participants in two phase 2 studies of bapineuzumab and an open-label extension study. Readers were masked to the patient's treatment, APOE e4 genotype, medical history, and demographics. Patients were included in risk analyses if they had no evidence of ARIA-E in their pre-treatment MRI, had received bapineuzumab, and had at least one MRI scan after treatment. We used Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to examine the distribution of incident ARIA-E from the start of bapineuzumab treatment and proportional hazards regression models to assess risk factors associated with ARIA. FINDINGS: 210 patients were included in the risk analyses. 36 patients (17%) developed ARIA-E during treatment with bapineuzumab; 15 of these ARIA-E cases (42%) had not been detected previously. 28 of these patients (78%) did not report associated symptoms. Adverse events, reported in eight symptomatic patients, included headache, confusion, and neuropsychiatric and gastrointestinal symptoms. Incident ARIA-H occurred in 17 of the patients with ARIA-E (47%), compared with seven of 177 (4%) patients without ARIA-E. 13 of the 15 patients in whom ARIA were detected in our study received additional treatment infusions while ARIA-E were present, without any associated symptoms. Occurrence of ARIA-E increased with bapineuzumab dose (hazard ratio [HR] 2 24 per 1 mg/kg increase in dose, 95% CI 1 40-3 62; p=0 0008) and presence of APOE e4 alleles (HR 2 55 per allele, 95% CI 1 57-4 12; p=0 0001). INTERPRETATION: ARIA consist of a spectrum of imaging findings with variable clinical correlates, and some patients with ARIA-E remain asymptomatic even if treatment is continued. The increased risk of ARIA among APOE e4 carriers, its association with high bapineuzumab dose, and its timecourse in relation to dosing suggest an association between ARIA and alterations in vascular amyloid burden.

22305861|t|Amyloid precursor protein is a biomarker for transformed human pluripotent stem cells.
22305861|a|Increasing evidence suggests an important function of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) in malignant disease in humans; however, the biological basis for this evidence is not well understood at present. To understand the role of APP in transformed pluripotent stem cells, we studied its expression levels in human testicular germ cell tumors using patient tissues, model cell lines, and an established xenograft mouse model. In the present study, we demonstrate the cooperative expression of APP with prominent pluripotency-related genes such as Sox2, NANOG, and POU5F1 (Oct3/4). The closest homologue family member, APLP2, showed no correlation to these stem cell factors. In addition, treatment with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors suppressed the levels of APP and stem cell markers. Loss of pluripotency, either spontaneously or as a consequence of treatment with an HDAC inhibitor, was accompanied by decreased APP protein levels both in vitro and in vivo. These observations suggest that APP represents a novel and specific biomarker in human transformed pluripotent stem cells that can be selectively modulated by HDAC inhibitors.

22306812|t|Oxidative stress increases BACE1 protein levels through activation of the PKR-eIF2alpha pathway.
22306812|a|Beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the rate limiting enzyme for accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta)-peptide in the brain in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Oxidative stress (OS) that leads to metabolic dysfunction and apoptosis of neurons in AD enhances BACE1 expression and activity. The activation of c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway was proposed to explain the BACE1 mRNA increase under OS. However, little is known about the translational control of BACE1 in OS. Recently, a post-transcriptional increase of BACE1 level controlled by phosphorylation of eIF2alpha (eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2alpha) have been described after energy deprivation. PKR (double-stranded RNA dependant protein kinase) is a pro-apoptotic kinase that phosphorylates eIF2alpha and modulates JNK activation in various cellular stresses. We investigated the relations between PKR, eIF2alpha and BACE1 in AD brains in APP/PS1 knock-in mice and in hydrogen peroxide-induced OS in human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cell cultures. Immunoblotting results showed that activated PKR (pPKR) and activated eIF2alpha (peIF2alpha) and BACE1 levels are increased in AD cortices and BACE1 correlate with phosphorylated eIF2alpha levels. BACE1 protein levels are increased in response to OS in SH-SY5Y cells and specific inhibitions of PKR-eIF2alpha attenuate BACE1 protein levels in this model. Our findings provide a new translational regulation of BACE1, under the control of PKR in OS, where eIF2alpha phosphorylation regulates BACE1 protein expression.

22307640|t|Abeta neurotoxicity depends on interactions between copper ions, prion protein, and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors.
22307640|a|N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) mediate critical CNS functions, whereas excessive activity contributes to neuronal damage. At physiological glycine concentrations, NMDAR currents recorded from cultured rodent hippocampal neurons exhibited strong desensitization in the continued presence of NMDA, thus protecting neurons from calcium overload. Reducing copper availability by specific chelators (bathocuproine disulfonate, cuprizone) induced nondesensitizing NMDAR currents even at physiologically low glycine concentrations. This effect was mimicked by, and was not additive with, genetic ablation of cellular prion protein (PrP(C)), a key copper-binding protein in the CNS. Acute ablation of PrP(C) by enzymatically cleaving its cell-surface GPI anchor yielded similar effects. Biochemical studies and electrophysiological measurements revealed that PrP(C) interacts with the NMDAR complex in a copper-dependent manner to allosterically reduce glycine affinity for the receptor. Synthetic human Abeta(1-42) (10 nM-5 muM) produced an identical effect that could be mitigated by addition of excess copper ions or NMDAR blockers. Taken together, Abeta(1-42), copper chelators, or PrP(C) inactivation all enhance the activity of glycine at the NMDAR, giving rise to pathologically large nondesensitizing steady-state NMDAR currents and neurotoxicity. We propose a physiological role for PrP(C), one that limits excessive NMDAR activity that might otherwise promote neuronal damage. In addition, we provide a unifying molecular mechanism whereby toxic species of Abeta(1-42) might mediate neuronal and synaptic injury, at least in part, by disrupting the normal copper-mediated, PrP(C)-dependent inhibition of excessive activity of this highly calcium-permeable glutamate receptor.

22308347|t|Withania somnifera reverses Alzheimer's disease pathology by enhancing low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein in liver.
22308347|a|A 30-d course of oral administration of a semipurified extract of the root of Withania somnifera consisting predominantly of withanolides and withanosides reversed behavioral deficits, plaque pathology, accumulation of beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta) and oligomers in the brains of middle-aged and old APP/PS1 Alzheimer's disease transgenic mice. It was similarly effective in reversing behavioral deficits and plaque load in APPSwInd mice (line J20). The temporal sequence involved an increase in plasma Abeta and a decrease in brain Abeta monomer after 7 d, indicating increased transport of Abeta from the brain to the periphery. Enhanced expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) in brain microvessels and the Abeta-degrading protease neprilysin (NEP) occurred 14-21 d after a substantial decrease in brain Abeta levels. However, significant increase in liver LRP and NEP occurred much earlier, at 7 d, and were accompanied by a rise in plasma sLRP, a peripheral sink for brain Abeta. In WT mice, the extract induced liver, but not brain, LRP and NEP and decreased plasma and brain Abeta, indicating that increase in liver LRP and sLRP occurring independent of Abeta concentration could result in clearance of Abeta. Selective down-regulation of liver LRP, but not NEP, abrogated the therapeutic effects of the extract. The remarkable therapeutic effect of W. somnifera mediated through up-regulation of liver LRP indicates that targeting the periphery offers a unique mechanism for Abeta clearance and reverses the behavioral deficits and pathology seen in Alzheimer's disease models.

22309053|t|Early and selective impairments in axonal transport kinetics of synaptic cargoes induced by soluble amyloid beta-protein oligomers.
22309053|a|The downstream targets of amyloid beta (Abeta)-oligomers remain elusive. One hypothesis is that Abeta-oligomers interrupt axonal transport. Although previous studies have demonstrated Abeta-induced transport blockade, early effects of low-n soluble Abeta-oligomers on axonal transport remain unclear. Furthermore, the cargo selectivity for such deficits (if any) or the specific effects of Abeta on the motility kinetics of transported cargoes are also unknown. Toward this, we visualized axonal transport of vesicles in cultured hippocampal neurons treated with picomolar (pm) levels of cell-derived soluble Abeta-oligomers. We examined select cargoes thought to move as distinct organelles and established imaging parameters that allow organelle tracking with consistency and high fidelity - analyzing all data in a blinded fashion. Abeta-oligomers induced early and selective diminutions in velocities of synaptic cargoes but had no effect on mitochondrial motility, contrary to previous reports. These changes were N-methyl D-aspartate receptor/glycogen synthase kinase-3beta dependent and reversible upon washout of the oligomers. Cluster-mode analyses reveal selective attenuations in faster-moving synaptic vesicles, suggesting possible decreases in cargo/motor associations, and biochemical experiments implicate tau phosphorylation in the process. Collectively, the data provide a biological basis for Abeta-induced axonal transport deficits.

22310032|t|Plasma beta-amyloid peptides levels: a pilot study in bipolar depressed patients.
22310032|a|BACKGROUND: Patients with mood disorders present a great risk for dementia and generally for cognitive decline. Low levels of beta-amyloid peptide 1-42 (Abeta42) and high Abeta40/Abeta42 ratio have been associated with this risk and have been reported also in geriatric patients suffering from depression. The aim of the present study was to compare the plasma levels of Abeta40 and Abeta42 in patients with bipolar depression and healthy subjects, and to correlate them with the characteristics of clinical course. METHODS: Levels of Abeta40 and Abeta42 were measured by using specific ELISA kits in 16 patients with bipolar depression and in 16 control subjects with a negative history for somatic, psychiatric, neurological and substance abuse disorders. RESULTS: Patients presented significantly lower plasma Abeta42 levels and higher Abeta40/Abeta42 ratio, as compared with control subjects. Moreover, a significant negative correlation was found between Abeta42 plasma levels and the duration of the illness, while a positive correlation was detected between the Abeta40/Abeta42 ratio and the number of affective episodes. LIMITATIONS: The major limitations of the study are the small sample size, the scanty characterization of the illness episodes and the fact that all the patients were under psychopharmacological treatment. CONCLUSION: Although further research is necessary to establish firm conclusions, the present data would suggest that changes in plasma levels of different Abeta peptides might represent a useful tool to identify the risk for cognitive decline in bipolar patients.

22312163|t|Revised criteria for mild cognitive impairment may compromise the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease dementia.
22312163|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential impact of revised criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI), developed by a work group sponsored by the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association, on the diagnosis of very mild and mild Alzheimer disease (AD)dementia. DESIGN: Retrospective review of ratings of functional impairment across diagnostic categories. SETTING: Alzheimer's Disease Centers and the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals (N=17 535) with normal cognition,MCI, or AD dementia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The functional ratings of individuals with normal cognition, MCI, or AD dementia who were evaluated at Alzheimer's Disease Centers and submitted to the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center were assessed in accordance with the definition of "functional independence" allowed by the revised criteria. Pairwise demographic differences between the 3 diagnostic groups were tested using t tests for continuous variables and 2 for categorical variables. RESULTS: Almost all (99.8%) individuals currently diagnosed with very mild AD dementia and the large majority(92.7%) of those diagnosed with mild AD dementia could be reclassified as having MCI with the revised criteria,based on their level of impairment in the Clinical Dementia Rating domains for performance of instrumental activities of daily living in the community and at home.Large percentages of these individuals with AD dementia also meet the revised "functional independence" criterion for MCI as measured by the Functional Assessment Questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: The categorical distinction between MCI and milder stages of AD dementia has been compromised by the revised criteria. The resulting diagnostic overlap supports the premise that "MCI due to AD" represents the earliest symptomatic stage of AD.

22313091|t|Combining dyad protonation and active site plasticity in BACE-1 structure-based drug design.
22313091|a|The ability of the BACE-1 catalytic dyad to adopt multiple protonation states and the conformational flexibility of the active site have hampered the reliability of computational screening campaigns carried out on this drug target for Alzheimer's disease. Here, we propose a protocol that, for the first time, combining quantum mechanical calculations, molecular dynamics, and conformational ensemble virtual ligand screening addresses these issues simultaneously. The encouraging results prefigure this approach as a valuable tool for future drug discovery campaigns.

22313790|t|Prenatal lead levels, plasma amyloid beta levels, and gene expression in young adulthood.
22313790|a|BACKGROUND: Animal studies suggest that early-life lead exposure influences gene expression and production of proteins associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). OBJECTIVES: We attempted to assess the relationship between early-life lead exposure and potential biomarkers for AD among young men and women. We also attempted to assess whether early-life lead exposure was associated with changes in expression of AD-related genes. METHODS: We used sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) to measure plasma concentrations of amyloid beta proteins Abeta40 and Abeta42 among 55 adults who had participated as newborns and young children in a prospective cohort study of the effects of lead exposure on development. We used RNA microarray techniques to analyze gene expression. RESULTS: Mean plasma Abeta42 concentrations were lower among 13 participants with high umbilical cord blood lead concentrations (>= 10 mug/dL) than in 42 participants with lower cord blood lead concentrations (p = 0.08). Among 10 participants with high prenatal lead exposure, we found evidence of an inverse relationship between umbilical cord lead concentration and expression of ADAM metallopeptidase domain 9 (ADAM9), reticulon 4 (RTN4), and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein associated protein 1 (LRPAP1) genes, whose products are believed to affect Abeta production and deposition. Gene network analysis suggested enrichment in gene sets involved in nerve growth and general cell development. CONCLUSIONS: Data from our exploratory study suggest that prenatal lead exposure may influence Abeta-related biological pathways that have been implicated in AD onset. Gene network analysis identified further candidates to study the mechanisms of developmental lead neurotoxicity.

22315232|t|Identification of novel gamma-secretase-associated proteins in detergent-resistant membranes from brain.
22315232|a|In Alzheimer disease, oligomeric amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) species lead to synapse loss and neuronal death. gamma-Secretase, the transmembrane protease complex that mediates the final catalytic step that liberates Abeta from its precursor protein (APP), has a multitude of substrates, and therapeutics aimed at reducing Abeta production should ideally be specific for APP cleavage. It has been shown that APP can be processed in lipid rafts, and gamma-secretase-associated proteins can affect Abeta production. Here, we use a biotinylated inhibitor for affinity purification of gamma-secretase and associated proteins and mass spectrometry for identification of the purified proteins, and we identify novel gamma-secretase-associated proteins in detergent-resistant membranes from brain. Furthermore, we show by small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of gene expression that a subset of the gamma-secretase-associated proteins, in particular voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) and contactin-associated protein 1 (CNTNAP1), reduced Abeta production (Abeta40 and Abeta42) by around 70%, whereas knockdown of presenilin 1, one of the essential gamma-secretase complex components, reduced Abeta production by 50%. Importantly, these proteins had a less pronounced effect on Notch processing. We conclude that VDAC1 and CNTNAP1 associate with gamma-secretase in detergent-resistant membranes and affect APP processing and suggest that molecules that interfere with this interaction could be of therapeutic use for Alzheimer disease.

22315405|t|Aberration-free three-dimensional multiphoton imaging of neuronal activity at kHz rates.
22315405|a|Multiphoton microscopy is a powerful tool in neuroscience, promising to deliver important data on the spatiotemporal activity within individual neurons as well as in networks of neurons. A major limitation of current technologies is the relatively slow scan rates along the z direction compared to the kHz rates obtainable in the x and y directions. Here, we describe a custom-built microscope system based on an architecture that allows kHz scan rates over hundreds of microns in all three dimensions without introducing aberration. We further demonstrate how this high-speed 3D multiphoton imaging system can be used to study neuronal activity at millisecond resolution at the subcellular as well as the population level.

22315713|t|Presenilins and gamma-secretase: structure, function, and role in Alzheimer Disease.
22315713|a|Presenilins were first discovered as sites of missense mutations responsible for early-onset Alzheimer disease (AD). The encoded multipass membrane proteins were subsequently found to be the catalytic components of gamma-secretases, membrane-embedded aspartyl protease complexes responsible for generating the carboxyl terminus of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) from the amyloid protein precursor (APP). The protease complex also cleaves a variety of other type I integral membrane proteins, most notably the Notch receptor, signaling from which is involved in many cell differentiation events. Although gamma-secretase is a top target for developing disease-modifying AD therapeutics, interference with Notch signaling should be avoided. Compounds that alter Abeta production by gamma-secretase without affecting Notch proteolysis and signaling have been identified and are currently at various stages in the drug development pipeline.

22315714|a|Biochemical and neuropathological studies of brains from individuals with Alzheimer disease (AD) provide clear evidence for an activation of inflammatory pathways, and long-term use of anti-inflammatory drugs is linked with reduced risk to develop the disease. As cause and effect relationships between inflammation and AD are being worked out, there is a realization that some components of this complex molecular and cellular machinery are most likely promoting pathological processes leading to AD, whereas other components serve to do the opposite. The challenge will be to find ways of fine tuning inflammation to delay, prevent, or treat AD.

22321194|t|beta-Amyloid exacerbates inflammation in astrocytes lacking fatty acid amide hydrolase through a mechanism involving PPAR-alpha, PPAR-gamma and TRPV1, but not CB1 or CB2 receptors.
22321194|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The endocannabinoid system may regulate glial cell functions and their responses to pathological stimuli, specifically, Alzheimer's disease. One experimental approach is the enhancement of endocannabinoid tone by blocking the activity of degradative enzymes, such as fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We examined the role of FAAH in the response of astrocytes to the pathologic form of beta-amyloid (Abeta). Astrocytes from wild-type mice (WT) and from mice lacking FAAH (FAAH-KO) were incubated with Abeta for 8, 24 and 48 h, and their inflammatory responses were quantified by elisa, western-blotting and real-time quantitative-PCR. KEY RESULTS: FAAH-KO astrocytes were significantly more responsive to Abeta than WT astrocytes, as shown by the higher production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Expression of COX-2, inducible NOS and TNF-alpha was also increased in Abeta-exposed KO astrocytes compared with that in WTs. These effects were accompanied by a differential pattern of activation of signalling cascades involved in mediating inflammatory responses, such as ERK1/2, p38MAPK and NFkappaB. PPAR-alpha and PPAR-gamma as well as transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1), but not cannabinoid CB1 or CB2 receptors, mediate some of the differential changes observed in Abeta-exposed FAAH-KO astrocytes. The pharmacological blockade of FAAH did not render astrocytes more sensitive to Abeta. In contrast, exogenous addition of several acylethanolamides (anandamide, palmitoylethanolamide and oleoylethanolamide) induced an antiinflammatory response. CONCLUSIONS: The genetic deletion of FAAH in astrocytes exacerbated their inflammatory phenotype against Abeta in a process involving PPAR-alpha, PPAR-gamma and TRPV1 receptors.

22323718|t|Differential effects between gamma-secretase inhibitors and modulators on cognitive function in amyloid precursor protein-transgenic and nontransgenic mice.
22323718|a|gamma-Secretase inhibitors (GSIs) reduce amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides but inevitably increase the beta-C-terminal fragment (beta-CTF) of amyloid precursor protein (APP), potentially having undesirable effects on synapses. In contrast, gamma-secretase modulators (GSMs) reduce Abeta42 without increasing beta-CTF. Although the Abeta-lowering effects of these compounds have been extensively studied, little effort has been made to investigate their effects on cognition. Here, we compared the effects of two GSIs--(2S)-2-hydroxy-3-methyl-N-[(2S)-1-{[(1S)-3-methyl-2-oxo-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepin-1-yl]amino}-1-oxopropan-2-yl]butanamide (LY450139, semagacestat) and (2R)-2-[[(4-chlorophenyl)sulfonyl][[2-fluoro-4-(1,2,4-oxazol-3-yl)phenyl]methyl]amino-5,5,5-trifluoropentanamide (BMS-708163)--and a second-generation GSM [{(2S,4R)-1-[(4R)-1,1,1-trifluoro-7-methyloctan-4-yl]-2-[4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]piperidin-4-yl}acetic acid (GSM-2)] on spatial working memory in APP-transgenic (Tg2576) and nontransgenic mice using the Y-maze task. While acute dosing with either GSI ameliorated memory deficits in 5.5-month-old Tg2576 mice, these effects disappeared after 8 d subchronic dosing. Subchronic dosing with either GSI rather impaired normal cognition in 3-month-old Tg2576 mice, with no inhibition on the processing of other gamma-secretase substrates, such as Notch, N-cadherin, or EphA4, in the brain. LY450139 also impaired normal cognition in wild-type mice; however, the potency was 10-fold lower than that in Tg2576 mice, indicating an APP-dependent mechanism likely with beta-CTF accumulation. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that the beta-CTF accumulation was localized in the presynaptic terminals of the hippocampal stratum lucidum and dentate hilus, implying an effect on presynaptic function in the mossy fibers. In contrast, both acute and subchronic dosing with GSM-2 significantly ameliorated memory deficits in Tg2576 mice and did not affect normal cognition in wild-type mice. We demonstrated a clear difference between GSI and GSM in effects on functional consequences, providing new insights into strategies for developing these drugs against Alzheimer's disease.

22323736|t|ApoE-directed therapeutics rapidly clear beta-amyloid and reverse deficits in AD mouse models.
22323736|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with impaired clearance of beta-amyloid (Abeta) from the brain, a process normally facilitated by apolipoprotein E (apoE). ApoE expression is transcriptionally induced through the action of the nuclear receptors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and liver X receptors in coordination with retinoid X receptors (RXRs). Oral administration of the RXR agonist bexarotene to a mouse model of AD resulted in enhanced clearance of soluble Abeta within hours in an apoE-dependent manner. Abeta plaque area was reduced more than 50% within just 72 hours. Furthermore, bexarotene stimulated the rapid reversal of cognitive, social, and olfactory deficits and improved neural circuit function. Thus, RXR activation stimulates physiological Abeta clearance mechanisms, resulting in the rapid reversal of a broad range of Abeta-induced deficits.

22323782|t|Clinical validation of 18F-AZD4694, an amyloid-beta-specific PET radioligand.
22323782|a|UNLABELLED: Pioneered with the invention of (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B, amyloid-beta imaging using PET has facilitated research in Alzheimer disease (AD). This imaging approach has promise for diagnostic purposes and evaluation of disease-modifying therapies. Broad clinical use requires an (18)F-labeled amyloid-beta radioligand with high specific and low nonspecific binding. The aim of the present PET study was to examine the radioligand (18)F-AZD4694 in human subjects. METHODS: Six control subjects and 10 clinically diagnosed AD patients underwent PET examination with (18)F-AZD4694 and a structural MRI scan. Of these, 4 controls and 4 patients underwent a second PET examination for test-retest analysis. Arterial sampling was done to derive a metabolite-corrected plasma input function for traditional compartment modeling. Besides, several simplified quantitative approaches were applied, including the reference Logan approach and simple ratio methods. RESULTS: After intravenous injection of (18)F-AZD4694, radioactivity appeared rapidly in brain. In patients, radioactivity was high in regions expected to contain amyloid-beta, whereas in controls, radioactivity was low and homogenously distributed. Binding in cerebellum, a reference region, was low and similar between the groups. Specific binding was reversible and peaked at about 27 min after injection in regions with high radioactivity. The time-activity curves could be described using the 2-tissue-compartment model. Distribution volume ratio estimates obtained using compartment models and simplified methods were highly correlated. Standardized uptake value ratios calculated at late times and distribution volume ratios estimated with the reference Logan approach were, in gray matter, significantly lower in control subjects (1.08 [11%] and 1.01 [6%], respectively) than in AD patients (2.15 [24%] and 1.62 [18%], respectively). Among noninvasive methods, the lowest test-retest variability was found with reference Logan, varying between 4% and 6% across brain regions. CONCLUSION: Noninvasive quantitative approaches provide valid estimates of amyloid-beta binding. Because of the radioisotope ((18)F) used for labeling, the radioligand has potential for wide clinical application. (18)F-AZD4694 satisfies the requirements for a promising amyloid-beta radioligand both for diagnostic use and for evaluation of disease-modifying therapies in AD.

22325097|t|AP-2beta regulates amyloid beta-protein stimulation of apolipoprotein E transcription in astrocytes.
22325097|a|Two key players involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are amyloid beta protein (Abeta) and apolipoprotein E (apoE). Abeta increases apoE protein levels in astrocytes which is associated with cholesterol trafficking, neuroinflammatory responses and Abeta clearance. The mechanism for the increase in apoE protein abundance is not understood. Based on different lines of evidence, we propose that the beta-adrenergic receptor (betaAR), cAMP and the transcription factor activator protein-2 (AP-2) are contributors to the Abeta-induced increase in apoE abundance. This hypothesis was tested in mouse primary astrocytes and in cells transfected with an apoE promoter fragment with binding sites for AP-2. Abeta(42) induced a time-dependent increase in apoE mRNA and protein levels which were significantly inhibited by betaAR antagonists. A novel finding was that Abeta incubation significantly reduced AP-2alpha levels and significantly increased AP-2beta levels in the nuclear fraction. The impact of Abeta-induced translocation of AP-2 into the nucleus was demonstrated in cells expressing AP-2 and incubated with Abeta(42). AP-2 expressing cells had enhanced activation of the apoE promoter region containing AP-2 binding sites in contrast to AP-2 deficient cells. The transcriptional upregulation of apoE expression by Abeta(42) may be a neuroprotective response to Abeta-induced cytotoxicity, consistent with apoE's role in cytoprotection.

22326143|t|Combined treatment of Abeta immunization with statin in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
22326143|a|We evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of combined treatment of Abeta-immunization with simvastatin in an Alzheimer mouse model at age 22 months. DNA prime-adenovirus boost immunization induced modest anti-Abeta titers and simvastatin increased the seropositive rate. Abeta-KLH was additionally administered to boost the titers. Irrespective of simvastatin, the immunization did not decrease cerebral Abeta deposits but increased soluble Abeta and tended to exacerbate amyloid angiopathy in the hippocampus. The immunization increased cerebral invasion of leukocytes and simvastatin counteracted the increase. Thus, modest anti-Abeta titers can increase soluble Abeta and simvastatin may reduce inflammation associated with vaccination in aged Alzheimer mouse models.

22326489|t|Novel S-acyl glutathione derivatives prevent amyloid oxidative stress and cholinergic dysfunction in Alzheimer disease models.
22326489|a|Oxidative stress-mediated neuronal death may be initiated by a decrease in glutathione (GSH), whose levels are reduced in mitochondrial and synaptosomal fractions of specific CNS regions in Alzheimer disease (AD) patients. Currently, the use of GSH as a therapeutic agent is limited by its unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties. In this study, we designed the synthesis of new S-acyl glutathione (acyl-SG) thioesters of fatty acids via N-acyl benzotriazole-intermediate production and investigated their potential for targeted delivery of the parent GSH and free fatty acid to amyloid-exposed fibroblasts from familial AD patients and human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Cell culture supplementation with acyl-SG derivatives triggers a significant decrease in lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial dysfunction in a fatty acid unsaturation degree-dependent fashion. Acyl-SG thioesters also protect cholinergic neurons against Abeta-induced damage and reduce glial reaction in rat brains. Collectively, these findings suggest that acyl-SG thioesters could prove useful as a tool for controlling AD-induced cerebral deterioration.

22326856|t|Abeta42 production in brain capillary endothelial cells after oxygen and glucose deprivation.
22326856|a|Although the diverse triggers of AD are still under debate, the hypothesis of the contribution of cerebrovascular deficiencies has emerged in recent years. Cerebrovascular dysfunction may precede cognitive decline and onset of neurodegeneration. Indeed, the toxic Abeta(42) aggregates constituting senile plaques, one of AD hallmarks, is often detected as amorphous material or fine fibrils in the brain capillary of AD patients. Abeta(42) causing cerebral microangiopathy might originate either from the circulating blood, the vessel wall itself or the brain parenchyma. In the present investigation we show, for the first time, that in rat brain capillary endothelial cells (RBE4), in vitro oxygen glucose deprivation treatment elicits 250% of Abeta(42) peptide production increase through a mechanism that involves the hypoxia inducible factor-1-mediated beta-secretase (BACE1) up-regulation. Furthermore, we observed a time dependent increase of amyloid protein precursor (AbetaPP) gene and protein expression, confirming previous reports which established the existence of AbetaPP in the cerebrovascular domain. Our experimental evidences point out that ischemic events may directly contribute in brain capillary endothelial cells to the enhancement of the amyloidogenic metabolism, leading to intracellular deposition of Abeta(42). This events may contribute to the impairment of Abeta brain clearance and AD related blood brain barrier dysfunctions.

22326870|t|Turn nucleation perturbs amyloid beta self-assembly and cytotoxicity.
22326870|a|The accumulation of senile plaques composed of amyloid beta (Abeta) fibrils is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, although prefibrillar oligomeric species are believed to be the primary neurotoxic congeners in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Uncertainty regarding the mechanistic relationship between Abeta oligomer and fibril formation and the cytotoxicity of these aggregate species persists. beta-Turn formation has been proposed to be a potential rate-limiting step during Abeta fibrillogenesis. The effect of turn nucleation on Abeta self-assembly was probed by systematically replacing amino acid pairs in the putative turn region of Abeta (residues 24-27) with d-ProGly ((D)PG), an effective turn-nucleating motif. The kinetic, thermodynamic, and cytotoxic effects of these mutations were characterized. It was found that turn formation dramatically accelerated Abeta fibril self-assembly dependent on the site of turn nucleation. The cytotoxicity of the three (D)PG-containing Abeta variants was significantly lower than that of wild-type Abeta40, presumably due to decreased oligomer populations as a function of a more rapid progression to mature fibrils; oligomer populations were not eliminated, however, suggesting that turn formation is also a feature of oligomer structures. These results indicate that turn nucleation is a critical step in Abeta40 fibril formation.

Conformational analysis of APP667-676 peptide [Ac-Ser-Glu-Val-Lys-Met-Asp-Ala-Glu-Phe-Arg-NH2] and the effect of substitution of Asp672 with D-Asp and iso-L-Asp, studied for the first time, demonstrate that the peptide backbone of APP667-676 is flexible and adopts different conformations in different solvent environments (water, trifluoroethanol and dimethylsulfoxide). A major conformational difference was observed in trifluoroethanol solvent when Asp672 is substituted with D-Asp and iso-Asp. These conformational changes involved in APP667-676 may assist in understanding the interactions between beta-secretase and APP667-676, with relevance to Alzheimer's disease.

22327103|t|A novel approach for Abeta1-40 quantification using immuno-PCR.
22327103|a|Several lines of evidence suggest that aggregation of the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) in the brain is a trigger of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, quantification of Abeta in several different types of samples from brain is fundamental for understanding AD pathogenesis. For analysis of the low levels of Abeta present in microdissected neurons, a more sensitive system than the ELISAs used today would be helpful. Here, we report a novel immuno-PCR (IPCR) system in which the lowest quantitative level of Abeta1-40 is 2 attomol/muL. We use the novel IPCR to quantify the intracellular Abeta1-40 levels in pyramidal neurons microdissected from human brain. We show that the level of Abeta1-40 is around 10 attomol/neuron, and thus, only 3 neurons are needed for analysis.

22330831|t|4-O-methylhonokiol prevents memory impairment in the Tg2576 transgenic mice model of Alzheimer's disease via regulation of beta-secretase activity.
22330831|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is characterized by memory deficits and deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the brain. It has been known that neuroinflammation and oxidative stress are critical factors in the development of AD. 4-O-methylhonokiol, an extract from Magnolia officinalis, is known to have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects. Thus, we investigated the properties of 4-O-methylhonokiol against progression and development of AD in Tg2576 mice. Tg2576 mice models show memory impairment and AD-like pathological features including Abeta deposition. Oral administration of 4-O-methylhonokiol through drinking water (1 mg/kg in 0.0002% Tween 80) for 12 weeks not only prevented memory impairment but also inhibited Abeta deposition. In addition, 4-O-methylhonokiol decreased beta-secretase activity, oxidative lipid and protein damage levels, activation of astrocytes and microglia cells, and generation of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha with increase of glutathione level in the brain. Our results showed that 4-O-methylhonokiol effectively prevented memory impairment by down-regulating beta-secretase activity through inhibition of oxidative stress and neuroinflammatory responses in Tg2576 transgenic mice.

22331215|t|Performance characteristics of amyloid PET with florbetapir F 18 in patients with alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal subjects.
22331215|a|UNLABELLED: The objectives of this study were to examine the effective dose range and the test-retest reliability of florbetapir F 18 using, first, visual assessment by independent raters masked to clinical information and, second, semiautomated quantitative measures of cortical target area to cerebellum standardized uptake value ratios (SUVr) as primary outcome measures. Visual ratings of PET image quality and tracer retention or beta-amyloid (Abeta) binding expressed as SUVrs were compared after intravenous administration of either 111 MBq (3 mCi) or 370 MBq (10 mCi) of florbetapir F 18 in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 9) and younger healthy controls (YHCs) (n = 11). In a separate set of subjects (AD, n = 10; YHCs, n = 10), test-retest reliability was evaluated by comparing intrasubject visual read ratings and SUVrs for 2 PET images acquired within 4 wk of each other. RESULTS: There were no meaningful differences between the 111-MBq (3-mCi) and 370-MBq (10-mCi) dose in the visual rating or SUVr. The difference in the visual quality across 111 and 370 MBq showed a trend toward lower image quality, but no statistical significance was achieved (t test; t(1) = -1.617, P = 0.12) in this relatively small sample of subjects. At both dose levels, visual ratings of amyloid burden identified 100% of AD subjects as Abeta-positive and 100% of YHCs as Abeta-negative. Mean intrasubject test-retest variability for cortical average SUVrs with the cerebellum as a reference over the 50- to 70-min period was 2.4% +- 1.41% for AD subjects and 1.5% +- 0.84% for controls. The overall SUVr test-retest correlation coefficient was 0.99. The overall kappa-statistic for test-retest agreement for Abeta classification of the masked reads was 0.89 (95% confidence interval, 0.69-1.0). CONCLUSION: Florbetapir F 18 appears to have a wide effective dose range and a high test-retest reliability for both quantitative (SUVr) values and visual assessment of the ligand. These imaging performance properties provide important technical information on the use of florbetapir F 18 and PET to detect cerebral amyloid aggregates.

22332188|t|Prediction of cognitive decline by positron emission tomography of brain amyloid and tau.
22332188|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine whether 2-(1-{6-[(2-fluorine 18-labeled fluoroethyl)methylamino]-2-napthyl}ethylidene) malononitrile ([(18)F]FDDNP) brain regional values in individuals without dementia predict and correlate with future cognitive change. DESIGN: Two-year, longitudinal follow-up study. SETTING: A university research institute. PARTICIPANTS: Volunteer sample of 43 middle-aged and older persons (median age, 64 years), including 21 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 22 with normal aging. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Longitudinal [(18)F]FDDNP positron emission tomography (PET) binding values in the medial and lateral temporal, posterior cingulate, parietal, frontal, and global (mean) regions of interest; neuropsychological test battery measuring 5 cognitive domains, including memory, language, attention (and information-processing speed), executive functioning, and visuospatial ability. RESULTS: For the entire study group (MCI and normal aging), increases in frontal, posterior cingulate, and global binding at follow-up correlated with progression of memory decline (r = -0.32 to -0.37, P = .03 to .01) after 2 years. Moreover, higher baseline [(18)F]FDDNP binding was associated with future decline in most cognitive domains, including language, attention, executive, and visuospatial abilities (r = -0.31 to -0.56, P = .05 to .002). For the MCI group, frontal and parietal [(18)F]FDDNP binding yielded the greatest diagnostic accuracy in identifying converters to Alzheimer disease vs nonconverters after 2 years, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.72-1.00) compared with 0.68 (95% CI, 0.45-0.91) for medial temporal binding. CONCLUSIONS: [(18)F]FDDNP PET regional binding patterns are consistent with known neuropathologic patterns of plaque and tangle brain accumulation, spreading from the medial temporal to other neocortical regions as disease progresses. Because binding patterns predict future cognitive decline and increase over time along with clinical decline, [(18)F]FDDNP PET scanning may have practical utility in identifying people at risk for future cognitive decline and in tracking the effectiveness of novel interventions designed to prevent or delay neurodegeneration and cognitive decline.

22332189|t|Subjective cognition and amyloid deposition imaging: a Pittsburgh Compound B positron emission tomography study in normal elderly individuals.
22332189|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship between subjective cognition and the neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD), amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition, using carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography in normal elderly individuals. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis. SUBJECTS: Forty-eight cognitively normal elderly subjects (11 with high PiB uptake and 28 with low PiB uptake) were included. All underwent clinical and neuropsychological evaluations, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography. SETTING: Berkeley Aging Cohort Study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Relationship between PiB uptake and subjective cognition measures. RESULTS: Subjects with high PiB uptake showed significantly lower performance than those with low PiB uptake on an episodic memory measure and were less confident about their general memory abilities when required to evaluate themselves relative to other people of the same age. High and low PiB uptake groups did not differ on the accuracy of their cognitive self-reports compared with objective cognitive performance. General memory self-reports from the whole group were significantly correlated with regional PiB uptake in the right medial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex and in the right precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex. Reduced confidence about memory abilities was associated with greater PiB uptake in these brain regions. All results were independent of demographic variables and depressive affects. CONCLUSIONS: A decrease of self-confidence about memory abilities in cognitively normal elderly subjects may be related to the neuropathological hallmark of AD measured with PiB-positron emission tomography. Subjective cognitive impairment may represent a very early clinical manifestation of AD.

22332192|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for Alzheimer disease fluctuate significantly over time in a cohort of older, mildly symptomatic individuals. DESIGN: Biomarker validation in a clinical cohort. SETTING: University hospital inpatient unit. PARTICIPANTS: Ten patients admitted for CSF drainage for diagnostic purposes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The CSF levels of Abeta1-40, Abeta1-42, tau, and phosphorylated tau on threonine 181 (p-tau(181)) were measured every 6 hours for 24 or 36 hours. RESULTS: The mean coefficient of variation values for each biomarker assessed in our 10 patients were 5.5% (95% CI, 3.8%-10.0%) for Abeta1-42, 12.2% (9.0%-24.2%) for Abeta1-40, 8.2% (5.7%-15.1%) for total tau, and 11.9% (8.5%-23.0%) for p-tau(181). These values are only slightly higher than the variability in the assay. In addition, no significant circadian fluctuation in any Alzheimer disease biomarker was observed given the limitations of our sampling frequency. CONCLUSION: In a cohort of elderly patients, little fluctuation in the levels of important Alzheimer disease biomarkers in lumbar CSF is seen as a function of time.

22334705|t|First and second generation gamma-secretase modulators (GSMs) modulate amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide production through different mechanisms.
22334705|a|gamma-Secretase-mediated cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) results in the production of Alzheimer disease-related amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides. The Abeta42 peptide in particular plays a pivotal role in Alzheimer disease pathogenesis and represents a major drug target. Several gamma-secretase modulators (GSMs), such as the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (R)-flurbiprofen and sulindac sulfide, have been suggested to modulate the Alzheimer-related Abeta production by targeting the APP. Here, we describe novel GSMs that are selective for Abeta modulation and do not impair processing of Notch, EphB2, or EphA4. The GSMs modulate Abeta both in cell and cell-free systems as well as lower amyloidogenic Abeta42 levels in the mouse brain. Both radioligand binding and cellular cross-competition experiments reveal a competitive relationship between the AstraZeneca (AZ) GSMs and the established second generation GSM, E2012, but a noncompetitive interaction between AZ GSMs and the first generation GSMs (R)-flurbiprofen and sulindac sulfide. The binding of a (3)H-labeled AZ GSM analog does not co-localize with APP but overlaps anatomically with a gamma-secretase targeting inhibitor in rodent brains. Combined, these data provide compelling evidence of a growing class of in vivo active GSMs, which are selective for Abeta modulation and have a different mechanism of action compared with the original class of GSMs described.

22337825|a|Therapeutic agents that improve the memory loss of Alzheimer's disease (AD) may eventually be developed if drug targets are identified that improve memory deficits in appropriate AD animal models. One such target is beta-secretase which, in most AD patients, cleaves the wild-type (WT) beta-secretase site sequence of the amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) to produce neurotoxic amyloid-beta (Abeta). Thus, an animal model representing most AD patients for evaluating beta-secretase effects on memory deficits is one that expresses human AbetaPP containing the WT beta-secretase site sequence. BACE1 and cathepsin B (CatB) proteases have beta-secretase activity, but gene knockout studies have not yet validated that the absence of these proteases improves memory deficits in such an animal model. This study assessed the effects of deleting these protease genes on memory deficits in the AD mouse model expressing human AbetaPP containing the WT beta-secretase site sequence and the London gamma-secretase site (AbetaPPWT/Lon mice). Knockout of the CatB gene in the AbetaPPWT/Lon mice improved memory deficits and altered the pattern of Abeta-related biomarkers in a manner consistent with CatB having WT beta-secretase activity. But deletion of the BACE1 gene had no effect on these parameters in the AbetaPPWT/Lon mice. These data are the first to show that knockout of a putative beta-secretase gene results in improved memory in an AD animal model expressing the WT beta-secretase site sequence of AbetaPP, present in the majority of AD patients. CatB may be an effective drug target for improving memory deficits in most AD patients.

22337827|t|Impaired neuronal insulin signaling precedes Abeta42 accumulation in female AbetaPPsw/PS1DeltaE9 mice.
22337827|a|Reduced glucose utilization is likely to precede the onset of cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Similar aberrant glucose metabolism can also be detected in the brain of several AD mouse models. Although the cause of this metabolic defect is not well understood, it could be related to impaired insulin signaling that is increasingly being reported in AD brain. However, the temporal relationship between insulin impairment and amyloid-beta (Abeta) biogenesis is unclear. In this study using female AbetaPPsw/PS1DeltaE9 mice, we found that the level of Abeta40 was fairly constant in 6- to 15-month-old brains, whereas Abeta42 was only significantly increased in the 15-month-old brain. In contrast, increased levels of IRbeta, IGF-1R, IRS1, and IRS-2, along with reduced glucose and insulin content, were detected earlier in the 12-month-old brains of AbetaPPsw/PS1DeltaE9 mice. The reduction in brain glucose content was accompanied by increased GLUT3 and GLUT4 levels. Importantly, these changes precede the significant upregulation of Abeta42 level in the 15-month-old brain. Interestingly, reduction in the p85 subunit of PI3K was only apparent in the 15-month-old AbetaPPsw/PS1DeltaE9 mouse brain. Furthermore, the expression profile of IRbeta, IRS-2, and p85/PI3K in AbetaPPsw/PS1DeltaE9 was distinct in wild-type mice of a similar age. Although the exact mechanisms underlining this connection remain unclear, our results suggest a possible early role for insulin signaling impairment leading to amyloid accumulation in AbetaPPsw/PS1DeltaE9 mice.

22337828|t|Effects of amyloid-beta plaque proximity on the axon initial segment of pyramidal cells.
22337828|a|The output of cortical pyramidal cells reflects the balance between excitatory inputs of cortical and subcortical origin, and inhibitory inputs from distinct populations of cortical GABAergic interneurons, each of which selectively innervate different domains of neuronal pyramidal cells (i.e., dendrites, soma and axon initial segment [AIS]). In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the presence of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques alters the synaptic input to pyramidal cells in a number of ways. However, the effects of Abeta plaques on the AIS have still not been investigated to date. This neuronal domain is involved in input integration, as well as action potential initiation and propagation, and it exhibits Ca2+- and activity-dependent structural plasticity. The AIS is innervated by GABAergic axon terminals from chandelier cells, which are thought to exert a strong influence on pyramidal cell output. In the AbetaPP/PS1 transgenic mouse model of AD, we have investigated the effects of Abeta plaques on the morphological and neurochemical features of the AIS, including the cisternal organelle, using immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy, as well as studying the innervation of the AIS by chandelier cell axon terminals. There is a strong reduction in GABAergic terminals that appose AIS membrane surfaces that are in contact with Abeta plaques, indicating altered inhibitory synapsis at the AIS. Thus, despite a lack of gross structural alterations in the AIS, this decrease in GABAergic innervation may deregulate AIS activity and contribute to the hyperactivity of neurons in contact with Abeta plaques.

22338026|t|Intraneuronally injected amyloid beta inhibits long-term potentiation in rat hippocampal slices.
22338026|a|Extracellular accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has been reported that extracellular perfusion of Abeta inhibits long-term potentiation (LTP), which is strongly related to memory in animal models. However, it has recently been proposed that intracellular Abeta may be the first pathological change to occur in AD. Here, we have investigated the effect on LTP of intracellular injection of Abeta (Abeta(1-40), Abeta(1-42)) into hippocampal pyramidal cells using patch-clamp technique. We found that injection of 1 nM Abeta(1-42) completely blocked LTP, and extracellular perfusion of a p38 MAPK inhibitor or a metabotropic glutamate receptor blocker reversed these blocking effects on LTP. Furthermore, we have examined the effects of different concentrations of Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) on LTP and showed that Abeta(1-40) required a 1,000-fold higher concentration to attenuate LTP than 1 nM Abeta(1-42). These results indicate that LTP is impaired by Abeta injected into genetically wild-type neurons in the sliced hippocampus, suggesting an acute action of intracellular Abeta on the intracellular LTP-inducing machinery.

22339868|t|Investigating how peptide length and a pathogenic mutation modify the structural ensemble of amyloid beta monomer.
22339868|a|The aggregation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides plays an important role in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Despite extensive effort, it has been difficult to characterize the secondary and tertiary structure of the Abeta monomer, the starting point for aggregation, due to its hydrophobicity and high aggregation propensity. Here, we employ extensive molecular dynamics simulations with atomistic protein and water models to determine structural ensembles for Abeta(42), Abeta(40), and Abeta(42)-E22K (the Italian mutant) monomers in solution. Sampling of a total of >700 microseconds in all-atom detail with explicit solvent enables us to observe the effects of peptide length and a pathogenic mutation on the disordered Abeta monomer structural ensemble. Abeta(42) and Abeta(40) have crudely similar characteristics but reducing the peptide length from 42 to 40 residues reduces beta-hairpin formation near the C-terminus. The pathogenic Italian E22K mutation induces helix formation in the region of residues 20-24. This structural alteration may increase helix-helix interactions between monomers, resulting in altered mechanism and kinetics of Abeta oligomerization.

22341035|t|Cerebral microinfarcts: the invisible lesions.
22341035|a|The association between small but still visible lacunar infarcts and cognitive decline has been established by population-based radiological and pathological studies. Microscopic examination of brain sections shows even smaller but substantially more numerous microinfarcts, the focus of this Review. These lesions often result from small vessel pathologies such as arteriolosclerosis or cerebral amyloid angiopathy. They typically go undetected in clinical-radiological correlation studies that rely on conventional structural MRI, although the largest acute microinfarcts can be detected by diffusion-weighted imaging. In view of their high numbers and widespread distribution, microinfarcts could directly disrupt important cognitive networks and thus account for some of the neurological dysfunction associated with lesions visible on conventional MRI such as lacunar infarcts and white matter hyperintensities. Standardised neuropathological assessment criteria and the development of non-invasive means of detection during life would be major steps towards understanding the causes and consequences of otherwise macroscopically invisible microinfarcts.

22342341|t|Intracerebral microinjection of interleukin-4/interleukin-13 reduces beta-amyloid accumulation in the ipsilateral side and improves cognitive deficits in young amyloid precursor protein 23 mice.
22342341|a|We previously reported that the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-4 induced selective clearance of oligomeric beta-amyloid (Abeta(1-42)) in rat primary type 2 microglial cells. For the present study, we investigated whether IL-4 and IL-13 could activate microglial cells to induce Abeta clearance in vivo and improve cognitive deficits in APP23 mice, which are amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice. We administered an intracerebral microinjection of a mixture of IL-4 and IL-13 or of saline vehicle into one hemisphere of APP23 mice and their wild-type littermates, 4.5 and 9 months old, after which we evaluated the effects of these treatments on spatial learning and memory by Morris Water Maze test and on accumulated amounts of Abeta. The cytokine injection significantly improved memory deficits of 4.5-month-old APP23 mice, but did not do so in 9-month-old APP23 mice, even though similar Abeta reductions were observed in both age groups of APP23 mice in the ipsilateral neocortex. The cytokine injection improved memory impairment of 9-month-old wild-type (WT) mice in the probe trial. Immunohistochemical analysis of the 4.5-month-old APP23 mice revealed the presence of increased numbers of microglial cells at 2 days after the cytokine injection. In addition to induced CD36 expression in the activated microglia, increased expression of neprilysin, mainly in neurons, suggested that the cytokines improved the cognitive deficits via degradation and clearance of intra- and extraneuronal Abeta peptides, of buffer-extractable nonplaque form. Double immunostaining also revealed that most of the activated microglia had the M2-like phenotype. This unique mechanism of IL-4/IL-13-induced clearance of Abeta may provide an additional strategy to prevent and/or cure Alzheimer's disease at early stage.

22342361|t|Anticoagulants affect matrix metalloproteinase 9 levels in blood samples of stroke patients and healthy controls.
22342361|a|OBJECTIVES: Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) represents a promising marker for acute stroke management. In clinical studies MMP-9 has been quantified by ELISA using differing protocols. We aimed to establish a valid protocol by evaluation of preanalytics. DESIGN AND METHODS: Blood from stroke patients (n=28) and healthy controls (n=28) was drawn into tubes containing different anticoagulants (EDTA, citrate, lithium-heparin (heparin) and heparin with proteinase inhibitors) and processed after 0, 60 and 240 min. MMP-9 plasma protein and mRNA from mononuclear leukocytes were determined. RESULTS: In regard to anticoagulants used, samples showed different MMP-9 protein baseline values and kinetics. Stable MMP-9 protein concentrations were only measured from EDTA samples. Particularly in samples with proteinase inhibitors protein and mRNA concentrations increased over time. Kinetics did not differ between patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Preanalytics plays a key role for determination of MMP-9. EDTA seems to be a valid anticoagulant for MMP-9 protein measurement.

22342489|t|Protective effect of meloxicam-loaded nanocapsules against amyloid-beta peptide-induced damage in mice.
22342489|a|The objective of present study was to investigate the protective effect of M-NC against abeta (25-35) peptide-induced damage in mice, as the first step to evaluate their potential value for the treatment of AD. Moreover, we compared the effects of M-NC with free meloxicam (M-F). Mice were divided into six groups: (I) sham, (II) abeta, (III) M-NC, (IV) M-F, (V) M-NC+abeta and (VI) M-F+abeta. Mice were pre-treated with M-NC (5mg/kg, by gavage), M-F (5mg/kg, by gavage) or blank nanocapsules (B-NC). Thirty minutes after treatments, abeta peptide (3nmol) or filtered water were i.c.v. injected. Learning and memory were assessed with the Morris water maze (MWM) (days 4-7) and step-down-type passive-avoidance (SDPA) (days 7-8) tasks. At the end of the experimental protocol (day 8), animals were euthanized and brains were removed for biochemical determinations (reactive species (RS), non-protein thiols (NPSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione S-transferase (GST)) and histological examination. Our results confirmed that abeta peptide caused learning and memory deficits in mice. Histological analysis demonstrated neuronal loss, intense cellular accumulation and chromatolysis caused by abeta peptide. Furthermore, this study showed that oxidative stress was increased in mice that received abeta peptide. An important finding of the present study was the protective effect of M-NC in damage induced by abeta peptide. However, M-F did not have protective effect. In summary, the data reported herein clearly demonstrate that meloxicam carried by polymeric nanocapsules protected against learning and memory impairments, loss neuronal and oxidative stress in a mouse model of AD induced by abeta peptide.

22343315|t|Correlation of Abeta deposition in the nasal cavity with the formation of senile plaques in the brain of a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
22343315|a|The deposition of beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta) is commonly reported in the nasal cavity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, although the pathological significance of this finding is unknown. This study compared Abeta concentrations in the nasal area with those in the brain, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid, respectively. Immunohistochemical analysis identified Abeta deposits in the nasal epithelium of Tg2576 mice. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measurements revealed a correlation between the content of Abeta42 in the nasal area and that in the brain, but not with that in the blood. These results suggest that the highly accessible nasal cavity could be a useful site for diagnostic analysis of AD based on Abeta content.

22344258|t|Membrane lipid composition and its physicochemical properties define cell vulnerability to aberrant protein oligomers.
22344258|a|Increasing evidence suggests that the interaction of misfolded protein oligomers with cell membranes is a primary event resulting in the cytotoxicity associated with many protein-misfolding diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders. We describe here the results of a study on the relative contributions to toxicity of the physicochemical properties of protein oligomers and the cell membrane with which they interact. We altered the amount of cholesterol and the ganglioside GM1 in membranes of SH-SY5Y cells. We then exposed the cells to two types of oligomers of the prokaryotic protein HypF-N with different ultrastructural and cytotoxicity properties, and to oligomers formed by the amyloid-beta peptide associated with Alzheimer's disease. We identified that the degree of toxicity of the oligomeric species is the result of a complex interplay between the structural and physicochemical features of both the oligomers and the cell membrane.

22349409|t|Thyroid hormone regulation of APP (beta-amyloid precursor protein) gene expression in brain and brain cultured cells.
22349409|a|We have previously shown that the thyroid hormone triiodothyronine negatively regulates the transcriptional activity of the beta-amyloid precursor protein gene (APP) in cultured murine neuroblastoma cells, by a mechanism that involves binding of the nuclear thyroid hormone receptor (TR) to DNA sequences located within the first exon of the gene. In this report we present results showing that the thyroid hormones also repress the expression of APP in human neuroblastoma cells and in primary cultures of rat neurons. In addition, and in agreement with the results obtained in cultured cells, APP messenger RNA and protein levels are significantly higher in the brain of hypothyroid rats and mice, and also in Alzheimer-related brain regions dissected from KO mice lacking TRs. These results show that binding of the thyroid hormones to their nuclear receptors mediate their repressive effect on APP gene expression in vivo.

22350319|t|In vitro and in vivo comparisons of the effects of the fruiting body and mycelium of Antrodia camphorata against amyloid beta-protein-induced neurotoxicity and memory impairment.
22350319|a|Antrodia camphorata is a particular and precious medicinal mushroom, and its fruiting body was found to provide more efficient protection from oxidative stress and inflammation than its mycelium because of its higher content of triterpenoids, total phenols, and so on. In the previous in vitro studies, the mycelium of A. camphorata is proven to provide strong neuroprotection in neuron cells and suggested to have the potential of protection against neurotoxicity of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) known as the risk factor toward Alzheimer's disease (AD) development. However, the in vivo study and the comparison study with the fruiting body have not yet been investigated. This study compared the effect of the fruiting body and mycelium of A. camphorata on alleviating the Abeta40-induced neurocytotoxicity in the in vitro Abeta-damaged neuron cell model (PC-12 cell treated with Abeta40) and memory impairment in the in vivo AD animal model induced with a continuous brain infusion of Abeta40. In the results of in vitro and in vivo studies, the fruiting body possessed stronger anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory abilities for inhibiting neurocytotoxicity in Abeta40-treated PC-12 cells and Abeta40 accumulation in Abeta40-infused brain than mycelium. Moreover, hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) protein expression, known as an important AD risk factor, was suppressed by the treatment of fruiting body rather than that of mycelium in the in vitro and in vivo studies. These comparisons supported the reasons why the fruiting body resulted in a more significant improvement effect on working memory ability than mycelium in the AD rats.

22351850|t|CD4(+) T cells predominate in cerebrospinal fluid and leptomeningeal and parenchymal infiltrates in cerebral amyloid beta-related angiitis.
22351850|a|BACKGROUND: In amyloid (Abeta)-related angiitis (ABRA)of the central nervous system (CNS), cerebral amyloid angiopathy occurs in association with primary vasculitis of small- and medium-sized leptomeningeal and cortical arteries. It has been suggested that ABRA is triggered by vascular deposition of A followed by an Abeta-directed (auto)immune response. OBJECTIVE: To provide a detailed description of the cellular composition of the inflammatory infiltrates in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and CNS and their response to immunotherapy in a typical case of ABRA. DESIGN: Report of a single case. SETTING: Neurologic referral center. PATIENT: 67-year-old white woman. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Neurologic examination,magnetic resonance imaging, lumbar puncture, flow cytometry,leptomeningeal biopsy, and histopathologic analysis. RESULTS: In a typical case of ABRA, we demonstrate for the first time the presence of a vast majority of partially activated CD4(+) T cells in CSF and leptomeningeal and parenchymal (peri)vascular infiltrates, which were frequently found in close proximity to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-expressing microglia, epithelioid macrophages, and multinucleated giant cells containing intracellular deposits of Abeta. CONCLUSION: Our findings support the notion of adaptive Ass-directed autoimmunity as the underlying pathogenic mechanism in ABRA.

22353605|t|Deletion of the amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2) does not affect hippocampal neuron morphology or function.
22353605|a|Amyloid precursor protein (APP), the parent molecule to amyloid beta peptide, is part of a larger gene family with two mammalian homologues, amyloid precursor-like protein 1 (APLP1) and amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2). Initial knock-out studies demonstrated that while single APP family gene deletions produced relatively mild phenotypes, deficiency of APLP2 and one other member of the gene family resulted in perinatal lethality, suggesting vital roles masked by functional redundancy of the other homologues. Because of the importance of APP in Alzheimer's disease, the vast majority of studies to date have concentrated on the neuronal functions of APP, leaving limited data on its homologues. APLP2 is of particular interest as it contains high sequence homology with APP, is processed similarly, is expressed in overlapping spatial and temporal patterns, and is obligatory for lethality when combined with deficiency of either APLP1 or APP but does not contain the toxic amyloid beta sequence. Here we sought to test the role of APLP2 on neuronal structure and function using a combined approach involving in vitro and in vivo techniques in young and aged animals. Surprisingly, we found that unlike APP, APLP2 appears not to be essential for maintenance of dendritic structure, spine density, or synaptic function. Thus, there is clear divergence in the functional redundancy between APP and APLP2.

22354138|t|Correlation of amyloid PET ligand florbetapir F 18 binding with Abeta aggregation and neuritic plaque deposition in postmortem brain tissue.
22354138|a|BACKGROUND: Florbetapir F 18 (F-AV-45) is a positron emission tomography imaging ligand for the detection of amyloid aggregation associated with Alzheimer disease. Earlier data showed that florbetapir F 18 binds with high affinity to beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques in human brain homogenates (Kd=3.7 nM) and has favorable imaging pharmacokinetic properties, including rapid brain penetration and washout. This study used human autopsy brain tissue to evaluate the correlation between in vitro florbetapir F 18 binding and Abeta density measured by established neuropathologic methods. METHODS: The localization and density of florbetapir F 18 binding in frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections of postmortem brain tissue from 40 patients with a varying degree of neurodegenerative pathology was assessed by standard florbetapir F 18 autoradiography and correlated with the localization and density of Abeta identified by silver staining, thioflavin S staining, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: There were strong quantitative correlations between florbetapir F 18 tissue binding and both Abeta plaques identified by light microscopy (Silver staining and thioflavin S fluorescence) and by immunohistochemical measurements of Abeta using 3 antibodies recognizing different epitopes of the Abeta peptide. Florbetapir F 18 did not bind to neurofibrillary tangles. CONCLUSIONS: Florbetapir F 18 selectively binds Abeta in human brain tissue. The binding intensity was quantitatively correlated with the density of Abeta plaques identified by standard neuropathologic techniques and correlated with the density of Abeta measured by immunohistochemistry. As Abeta plaques are a defining neuropathologic feature for Alzheimer disease, these results support the use of florbetapir F 18 as an amyloid positron emission tomography ligand to identify the presence of Alzheimer disease pathology in patients with signs and symptoms of progressive late-life cognitive impairment.

22354745|t|Longitudinal plasma amyloid beta as a biomarker of Alzheimer's disease.
22354745|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects more than twenty-five million people worldwide and is the most common form of dementia. Symptomatic treatments have been developed, but effective intervention to alter disease progression is needed. Targets have been identified for disease-modifying drugs, but the results of clinical trials have been disappointing. Peripheral biomarkers of disease state may improve clinical trial design and analysis, increasing the likelihood of successful drug development. Amyloid-related measures, presumably reflecting principal pathology of AD, are among the leading cerebrospinal fluid and neuroimaging biomarkers, and measurement of plasma levels of amyloid peptides has been the focus of much investigation. In this review, we discuss recent data on plasma beta-amyloid (Abeta) and examine the issues that have arisen in establishing it as a reliable biomarker of AD.

22355143|t|Autoinhibition of Mint1 adaptor protein regulates amyloid precursor protein binding and processing.
22355143|a|Mint adaptor proteins bind to the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and regulate APP processing associated with Alzheimer's disease; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying Mint regulation in APP binding and processing remain unclear. Biochemical, biophysical, and cellular experiments now show that the Mint1 phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain that binds to APP is intramolecularly inhibited by the adjacent C-terminal linker region. The crystal structure of a C-terminally extended Mint1 PTB fragment reveals that the linker region forms a short alpha-helix that folds back onto the PTB domain and sterically hinders APP binding. This intramolecular interaction is disrupted by mutation of Tyr633 within the Mint1 autoinhibitory helix leading to enhanced APP binding and beta-amyloid production. Our findings suggest that an autoinhibitory mechanism in Mint1 is important for regulating APP processing and may provide novel therapies for Alzheimer's disease.

22355793|t|Frontotemporal dementia: implications for understanding Alzheimer disease.
22355793|a|Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) comprises a group of behavioral, language, and movement disorders. On the basis of the nature of the characteristic protein inclusions, frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) can be subdivided into the common FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP as well as the less common FTLD-FUS and FTLD-UPS. Approximately 10% of cases of FTD are inherited in an autosomal-dominant manner. Mutations in seven genes cause FTD, with those in tau (MAPT), chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72), and progranulin (GRN) being the most common. Mutations in MAPT give rise to FTLD-tau and mutations in C9ORF72 and GRN to FTLD-TDP. The other four genes are transactive response-DNA binding protein-43 (TARDBP), fused in sarcoma (FUS), valosin-containing protein (VCP), and charged multivesicular body protein 2B (CHMP2B). Mutations in TARDBP and VCP give rise to FTLD-TDP, mutations in FUS to FTLD-FUS, and mutations in CHMP2B to FTLD-UPS. The discovery that mutations in MAPT cause neurodegeneration and dementia has important implications for understanding Alzheimer disease.

22355794|t|Physiological functions of APP family proteins.
22355794|a|Biochemical and genetic evidence establishes a central role of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) in Alzheimer disease (AD) pathogenesis. Biochemically, deposition of the beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides produced from proteolytic processing of APP forms the defining pathological hallmark of AD; genetically, both point mutations and duplications of wild-type APP are linked to a subset of early onset of familial AD (FAD) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. As such, the biological functions of APP and its processing products have been the subject of intense investigation, and the past 20+ years of research have met with both excitement and challenges. This article will review the current understanding of the physiological functions of APP in the context of APP family members.

22357853|t|Neutralization of soluble, synaptotoxic amyloid beta species by antibodies is epitope specific.
22357853|a|Several anti-amyloid beta (Abeta) antibodies are under evaluation for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Clinical studies using the N-terminal-directed anti-Abeta antibody bapineuzumab have demonstrated reduced brain PET-Pittsburg-B signals, suggesting the reduction of Abeta plaques, and reduced levels of total and phosphorylated tau protein in the CSF of treated AD patients. Preclinical studies using 3D6 (the murine form of bapineuzumab) have demonstrated resolution of Abeta plaque and vascular burdens, neuritic dystrophy, and preservation of synaptic density in the transgenic APP mouse models. In contrast, few studies have evaluated the direct interaction of this antibody with synaptotoxic soluble Abeta species. In the current report, we demonstrated that 3D6 binds to soluble, synaptotoxic assemblies of Abeta(1-42) and prevents multiple downstream functional consequences in rat hippocampal neurons including changes in glutamate AMPA receptor trafficking, AD-type tau phosphorylation, and loss of dendritic spines. In vivo, we further demonstrated that 3D6 prevents synaptic loss and acutely reverses the behavioral deficit in the contextual fear conditioning task in transgenic mouse models of AD, two endpoints thought to be linked to synaptotoxic soluble Abeta moieties. Importantly C-terminal anti-Abeta antibodies were ineffective on these endpoints. These results, taken with prior studies, suggest that N-terminal anti-Abeta antibodies effectively interact with both soluble and insoluble forms of Abeta and therefore appear particularly well suited for testing the Abeta hypothesis of AD.

22361682|t|Pivotal role of the RanBP9-cofilin pathway in Abeta-induced apoptosis and neurodegeneration.
22361682|a|Neurodegeneration associated with amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide accumulation, synaptic loss, neuroinflammation, tauopathy, and memory impairments encompass the pathophysiological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We previously reported that the scaffolding protein RanBP9, which is overall increased in brains of AD patients, simultaneously promotes Abeta generation and focal adhesion disruption by accelerating the endocytosis of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and beta1-integrin, respectively. Here, we show that RanBP9 protein levels are increased by fourfold in FAD mutant APP transgenic mice. Accordingly, RanBP9 transgenic mice demonstrate significantly increased synapse loss, neurodegeneration, gliosis, and spatial memory deficits. RanBP9 overexpression promotes apoptosis and potentiates Abeta-induced neurotoxicity independent of its capacity to promote Abeta generation. Conversely, RanBP9 reduction by siRNA or gene dosage mitigates Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. Importantly, RanBP9 activates/dephosphorylates cofilin, a key regulator of actin dynamics and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, and siRNA knockdown of cofilin abolishes both Abeta and RanBP9-induced apoptosis. These findings implicate the RanBP9-cofilin pathway as critical therapeutic targets not only for stemming Abeta generation but also antagonizing Abeta-induced neurotoxicity.

22364445|t|Technetium-99m labeled pyridyl benzofuran derivatives as single photon emission computed tomography imaging probes for beta-amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's brains.
22364445|a|Three novel (99m)Tc-labeled pyridyl benzofuran derivatives were tested as potential probes for imaging beta-amyloid plaques using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The (99m)Tc and corresponding rhenium complexes were synthesized with bis(aminoethanethiol) (BAT) as a chelating ligand. All Re complexes showed affinity for Abeta(1-42) aggregates (K(i) = 13.6-149.6 nM). Biodistribution experiments in normal mice revealed that the (99m)Tc-labeled derivatives displayed sufficient uptake in the brain (1.41-1.80% ID/g at 2 min postinjection). Notably, [(99m)Tc]BAT-Bp-2 showed a good initial uptake (1.80% ID/g at 2 min) and a reasonable washout from the brain (0.79% ID/g at 60 min). Ex vivo autoradiography with [(99m)Tc]BAT-Bp-2 revealed substantial labeling of beta-amyloid plaques in sections of brain tissue from Tg2576 transgenic mice but not in the age-matched controls. [(99m)Tc]BAT-Bp-2 may be a potential SPECT probe for imaging beta-amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's brains.

22365544|t|Propagation of tau pathology in a model of early Alzheimer's disease.
22365544|a|Neurofibrillary tangles advance from layer II of the entorhinal cortex (EC-II) toward limbic and association cortices as Alzheimer's disease evolves. However, the mechanism involved in this hierarchical pattern of disease progression is unknown. We describe a transgenic mouse model in which overexpression of human tau P301L is restricted to EC-II. Tau pathology progresses from EC transgene-expressing neurons to neurons without detectable transgene expression, first to EC neighboring cells, followed by propagation to neurons downstream in the synaptic circuit such as the dentate gyrus, CA fields of the hippocampus, and cingulate cortex. Human tau protein spreads to these regions and coaggregates with endogenous mouse tau. With age, synaptic degeneration occurs in the entorhinal target zone and EC neurons are lost. These data suggest that a sequence of progressive misfolding of tau proteins, circuit-based transfer to new cell populations, and deafferentation induced degeneration are part of a process of tau-induced neurodegeneration.

22365952|t|Aquaporin-4 mediates astrocyte response to beta-amyloid.
22365952|a|It has been demonstrated that the water channel protein aquaporin-4 (AQP4) plays an important role in astrocyte plasticity in response to a variety of injuries or stimuli. However, the potential role of AQP4 in astrocyte response to beta-amyloid (Abeta) has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to investigate this issue. Compared to media control, the lower concentrations of Abeta(1-42) (0.1-1 muM) increased AQP4 expression in cultured mouse cortical astrocytes, while the higher concentrations of Abeta(1-42) (10 muM) decreased AQP4 expression. AQP4 gene knockout reduced Abeta(1-42)-induced astrocyte activation and apoptosis, which was associated with a reduction in the uptake of Abeta via decreased upregulation of low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein-1. Moreover, time-course and levels of Abeta(1-42)-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation were altered in AQP4 null astrocytes compared with wild-type controls. Our data reveal a novel role of AQP4 in the uptake of Abeta by astrocytes, indicating that AQP4 is a molecular target for Alzheimer's disease.

22366383|t|Metal-associated amyloid-beta species in Alzheimer's disease.
22366383|a|Highly concentrated metals such as Cu, Zn, and Fe are found in amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques within the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In vitro and in vivo studies have suggested that metal binding to Abeta could facilitate Abeta aggregation and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which could contribute to the neuropathogenesis of AD. The connection between metal-Abeta interaction/reactivity and AD development, however, has not been clearly revealed owing to the complexity of the disease. In this review, metal-Abeta interaction/reactivity and its relation to neurotoxicity are briefly discussed. Additionally, our review illustrates the recent progress of small molecules, capable of targeting metal-Abeta species and modulating their interaction/reactivity, which could offer a promising approach to interrogate their role in AD.

22366649|t|Amyloid precursor protein accumulates in aggresomes in response to proteasome inhibitor.
22366649|a|Aggresomes are cytoplasmic inclusions which are localized at the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) as a result of induced proteasome inhibition, stress or over-expression of certain proteins. Aggresomes are linked to the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases. Here we studied whether amyloid precursor protein (APP), a type-I transmembrane glycoprotein, is localized in aggresomes after exposure to stress condition. Using confocal microscopy we found that APP is located in aggresomes and co-localized with vimentin, gamma-tubulin, 20S and ubiquitin at the MTOC in response to proteasome dysfunction. An interaction between vimentin and APP was found after proteasome inhibition suggesting that APP is an additional protein constituent of aggresomes. Suppression of the proteasome system in APP-HEK293 cells overexpressing APP or transfected with APP Swedish mutation caused an accumulation of stable, detergent-insoluble forms of APP containing poly-ubiquitinated proteins. In addition, brain homogenates from transgenic mice expressing human APP with the Arctic mutation demonstrated an interaction between APP and the aggresomal-marker vimentin. These data suggest that malfunctioning of the proteasome system caused by mutation or overexpression of pathological or non-pathological proteins may lead to the accumulation of stable aggresomes, perhaps contributing to the neurodegeneration.

22372534|t|Estrogenic effect of ginsenoside Rg1 on APP processing in post-menopausal platelets.
22372534|a|Ginsenoside Rg1, an active component of high abundance in ginseng, has recently been reported to possess neuroprotective properties and also identified as a potent phytoestrogen. However, it is unknown whether Rg1 intervenes in amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, and whether such intervention is associated with its estrogenic activity. Using human platelets, this study demonstrated that Rg1 promoted alpha-secretase cleavage of APP via estrogenic activity. The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) pathway may be involved in the effect of Rg1 on APP metabolism as a downstream effector of estrogen receptor (ER) extranuclear signaling. Estrogen withdrawal is a risk factor for the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Rg1 exerts estrogenic activity in APP processing in platelets supporting the use of this compound in the prevention of AD, in particular in postmenopausal females.

22372824|t|Microbiosensor for Alzheimer's disease diagnostics: detection of amyloid beta biomarkers.
22372824|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects about 35.6 million people worldwide, and if current trends continue with no medical advancement, one in 85 people will be affected by 2050. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a cost-effective, easy to use, sensor platform to diagnose and study AD. The measurement of peptide amyloid beta (Abeta) found in CSF has been assessed as an avenue to diagnose and study the disease. The quantification of the ratio of Abeta1-40/42 (or Abeta ratio) has been established as a reliable test to diagnose AD through human clinical trials. Therefore, we have developed a multiplexed, implantable immunosensor to detect amyloid beta (Abeta) isoforms using triple barrel carbon fiber microelectrodes as the sensor platform. Antibodies act as the biorecognition element of the sensor and selectively capture and bind Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 to the electrode surface. Electrochemistry was used to measure the intrinsic oxidation signal of Abeta at 0.65 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), originating from a single tyrosine residue found at position 10 in its amino acid sequence. Using the proposed immunosensor Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 could be specifically detected in CSF from mice within a detection range of 20-50 nM and 20-140 nM respectively. The immunosensor enables real-time, highly sensitive detection of Abeta and opens up the possibilities for diagnostic ex vivo applications and research-based in vivo studies.

22373961|t|APP transgenic mice for modelling behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD).
22373961|a|The discovery of gene mutations responsible for autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease has enabled researchers to reproduce in transgenic mice several hallmarks of this disorder, notably Abeta accumulation, though in most cases without neurofibrillary tangles. Mice expressing mutated and wild-type APP as well as C-terminal fragments of APP exhibit variations in exploratory activity reminiscent of behavioural and psychological symptoms of Alzheimer dementia (BPSD). In particular, open-field, spontaneous alternation, and elevated plus-maze tasks as well as aggression are modified in several APP transgenic mice relative to non-transgenic controls. However, depending on the precise murine models, changes in open-field and elevated plus-maze exploration occur in either direction, either increased or decreased relative to controls. It remains to be determined which neurotransmitter changes are responsible for this variability, in particular with respect to GABA, 5HT, and dopamine.

22375951|t|N-Terminal pyroglutamate formation of Abeta38 and Abeta40 enforces oligomer formation and potency to disrupt hippocampal long-term potentiation.
22375951|a|Pyroglutamate (pGlu)-modified amyloid peptides have been identified in sporadic and familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the inherited disorders familial British and Danish Dementia (FBD and FDD). In this study, we characterized the aggregation of amyloid-beta protein Abeta37, Abeta38, Abeta40, Abeta42 and ADan species in vitro, which were modified by N-terminal pGlu (pGlu-Abeta3-x, pGlu-ADan) or possess the intact N-terminus (Abeta1-x, ADan). The pGlu-modification confers rapid formation of oligomers and short fibrillar aggregates. In accordance with these observations, the pGlu-modified Abeta38, Alphabeta40 and Alphabeta42 species inhibit hippocampal long term potentiation of synaptic response, but pGlu-Abeta3-42 showing the highest effect. Among the unmodified Abeta peptides, only Abeta1-42 exhibites such propensity, which was similar to pGlu-Abeta3-38 and pGlu-Abeta3-40. Likewise, the amyloidogenic peptide pGlu-ADan impaired synaptic potentiation more pronounced than N-terminal unmodified ADan. The results were validated using conditioned media from cultivated HEK293 cells, which express APP variants favoring the formation of Abeta1-x, Abeta3-x or N-truncated pGlu-Abeta3-x species. Hence, we show that the ability of different amyloid peptides to impair synaptic function apparently correlates to their potential to form oligomers as a common mechanism. The pGlu-modification is apparently mediating a higher surface hydrophobicity, as shown by 1-anilinonaphtalene-8-sulfonate fluorescence, which enforces potential to interfere with neuronal physiology.

22378880|t|Astrocyte-originated ATP protects Abeta(1-42)-induced impairment of synaptic plasticity.
22378880|a|Activated microglia and reactive astrocytes are commonly found in and around the senile plaque, which is the central pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Astrocytes respond to neuronal activity through the release of gliotransmitters such as glutamate, D-serine, and ATP. However, it is largely unknown whether and how gliotransmitters affect neuronal functions. In this study, we explored the effect of a gliotransmitter, ATP, on neurons damaged by beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta). We found that Abeta(1-42) (Abeta42) increased the release of ATP in cultures of primary astrocytes and U373 astrocyte cell line. We also found that exogenous ATP protected Abeta42-mediated reduction in synaptic molecules, such as NMDA receptor 2A and PSD-95, through P2 purinergic receptors and prevented Abeta42-induced spine reduction in cultured primary hippocampal neurons. Moreover, ATP prevented Abeta42-induced impairment of long-term potentiation in acute hippocampal slices. Our findings suggest that Abeta-induced release of gliotransmitter ATP plays a protective role against Abeta42-mediated disruption of synaptic plasticity.

22378890|t|Inhibition of the NFAT pathway alleviates amyloid beta neurotoxicity in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
22378890|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides, the main pathological species associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), disturb intracellular calcium homeostasis, which in turn activates the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (CaN). CaN activation induced by Abeta leads to pathological morphological changes in neurons, and overexpression of constitutively active calcineurin is sufficient to generate a similar phenotype, even without Abeta. Here, we tested the hypothesis that calcineurin mediates neurodegenerative effects via activation of the nuclear transcription factor of activated T-cells (NFAT). We found that both spine loss and dendritic branching simplification induced by Abeta exposure were mimicked by constitutively active NFAT, and abolished when NFAT activation was blocked using the genetically encoded inhibitor VIVIT. When VIVIT was specifically addressed to the nucleus, identical beneficial effects were observed, thus enforcing the role of NFAT transcriptional activity in Abeta-related neurotoxicity. In vivo, when VIVIT or its nuclear counterpart were overexpressed in a transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease via a gene therapy approach, the spine loss and neuritic abnormalities observed in the vicinity of amyloid plaques were blocked. Overall, these results suggest that NFAT/calcineurin transcriptional cascades contribute to Abeta synaptotoxicity, and may provide a new specific set of pathways for neuroprotective strategies.

22380629|t|Discovery of cyclic sulfone hydroxyethylamines as potent and selective beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) inhibitors: structure-based design and in vivo reduction of amyloid beta-peptides.
22380629|a|Structure-based design of a series of cyclic hydroxyethylamine BACE1 inhibitors allowed the rational incorporation of prime- and nonprime-side fragments to a central core template without any amide functionality. The core scaffold selection and the structure-activity relationship development were supported by molecular modeling studies and by X-ray analysis of BACE1 complexes with various ligands to expedite the optimization of the series. The direct extension from P1-aryl- and heteroaryl moieties into the S3 binding pocket allowed the enhancement of potency and selectivity over cathepsin D. Restraining the design and synthesis of compounds to a physicochemical property space consistent with central nervous system drugs led to inhibitors with improved blood-brain barrier permeability. Guided by structure-based optimization, we were able to obtain highly potent compounds such as 60p with enzymatic and cellular IC(50) values of 2 and 50 nM, respectively, and with >200-fold selectivity over cathepsin D. Pharmacodynamic studies in APP51/16 transgenic mice at oral doses of 180 mumol/kg demonstrated significant reduction of brain Abeta levels.

22381398|t|Nicotine modifies in vivo and in vitro rat hippocampal amyloid precursor protein processing in young but not old rats.
22381398|a|Previous studies have shown that administration of nicotine modifies the expression and secretion of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in various cell lines. The present study investigated the extent to which chronic subcutaneous nicotine administration influences APP levels and processing in cerebral cortex, striatum and hippocampus of young and old rat brains. The results showed that constant nicotine infusion (0.25 or 4.00mg/kg/day) increased the levels of particulate APP (APPp) but not secreted APP (APPs) in the hippocampus of young rats in vivo. This response to nicotine was not observed in the striatum or cerebral cortex of young rats or in any of the brain regions examined in old animals. Subsequent in vitro analysis demonstrated that nicotine enhanced the release of APPs from hippocampal slice preparations and that this increase was attenuated by mecamylamine, a non-selective nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist. The in vitro effect of nicotine on APPs was age-related, being only detected from hippocampal slices derived from the young but not the older animals. These results suggest that nicotine modulates APP expression and secretion in the hippocampus and that the responses observed to the drug are age-dependent being only detected in younger rats.

22383525|a|Accumulation of the amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide within the brain is hypothesized to be one of the main causes underlying the pathogenic events that occur in Alzheimer disease (AD). Consequently, identifying pathways by which Abeta is cleared from the brain is crucial for better understanding of the disease pathogenesis and developing novel therapeutics. Cellular uptake and degradation by glial cells is one means by which Abeta may be cleared from the brain. In the current study, we demonstrate that modulating levels of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), a cell surface receptor that regulates the amount of apolipoprotein E (apoE) in the brain, altered both the uptake and degradation of Abeta by astrocytes. Deletion of LDLR caused a decrease in Abeta uptake, whereas increasing LDLR levels significantly enhanced both the uptake and clearance of Abeta. Increasing LDLR levels also enhanced the cellular degradation of Abeta and facilitated the vesicular transport of Abeta to lysosomes. Despite the fact that LDLR regulated the uptake of apoE by astrocytes, we found that the effect of LDLR on Abeta uptake and clearance occurred in the absence of apoE. Finally, we provide evidence that Abeta can directly bind to LDLR, suggesting that an interaction between LDLR and Abeta could be responsible for LDLR-mediated Abeta uptake. Therefore, these results identify LDLR as a receptor that mediates Abeta uptake and clearance by astrocytes, and provide evidence that increasing glial LDLR levels may promote Abeta degradation within the brain.

22386910|t|Anti-Abeta-MAb and dually decorated nanoliposomes: effect of Abeta1-42 peptides on interaction with hCMEC/D3 cells.
22386910|a|Anti-Abeta-MAb (Abeta-MAb)-decorated immunoliposomes (LIP) and dually decorated ones (dd-LIP) with OX-26 and Abeta-MAb were constructed. In both cases, the biotin-streptavidin ligation method was applied. All LIP types were characterized for size distribution, zeta potential, and integrity during incubation with serum proteins. Uptake and transcytosis of both LIP types and control vesicles by human brain endothelial hCMEC/D3 cells were measured. All LIP types had mean diameters below 150-200 nm and low polydispersity. Abeta-MAb-LIP uptake was higher than control PEGylated liposomes, while uptake of dd-LIP was similar to that of OX-26-LIP. Abeta-MAb-LIP and dd-LIP uptake increased significantly when cells were pre-incubated with Abeta1-42 peptides; OX-26-LIP uptake was not modulated. Transcytosis of Abeta-MAb-LIP through monolayers was 2.5 times higher when monolayers were pre-incubated with Abeta1-42. Transport of both probes, FITC-dextran and rhodamine-lipid, was equivalent, indicating that Abeta-MAb-LIP are transferred intact through the BBB model. The Abeta peptide-induced increase in binding (and transport) is regulated by the membrane receptors for Abeta1-42 peptides (RAGE), as proven after blocking RAGE by a specific MAb. Abeta1-42 peptides did not modulate the barrier tightness and integrity, as determined by transendothelial resistance and Lucifer Yellow permeability. Additionally, hCMEC/D3 cell viability was not affected by Abeta peptides or by Abeta-MAb-LIP.

22387154|t|Protective role of N-trans-feruloyltyramine against beta-amyloid peptide-induced neurotoxicity in rat cultured cortical neurons.
22387154|a|Enhanced oxidative stress and inflammation play important roles in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta), a major component of amyloid plaques, is considered to have a causal role in the development and progress of AD by being the initiator of a pathological cascade leading to oxidative stress. The present study investigated the effect of N-trans-feruloyltyramine (NTF) purified from Polyalthia suberosa, an alkaloid shown to protect against oxidative stress and cell death. Pre-treatment of rat primary cortical cell cultures with 25-250muM NTF significantly attenuated 10muM Abeta(1-42)-induced neuronal death in a dose-dependent manner. Apoptotic cell death was demonstrated morphologically as well as by detection of the presence of activated caspase-3 and Bax, levels of which could be reduced by NTF pre-treatment. NTF also reduced production of reactive oxygen species induced by Abeta(1-42). These findings suggest that the protective effect of NTF against Abeta(1-42)-induced neuronal death might be due to its antioxidative property.

22387410|t|Context-dependent toxicity of amyloid-beta peptides on mouse cerebellar cells.
22387410|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the major cause of dementia in old people. AD pathology is characterized by amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposits in several regions of the brain, and links have been hypothesized between Abeta toxicity and apoptosis. Cerebellar granule cells (CGCs) have been widely used as in vitro tools for molecular studies correlating apoptosis with AD, although the cerebellum is a relatively spared area of the brain in vivo. We have used mixed neuronal-glial cerebellar cultures (NGCCs) and organotypic cerebellar cultures (OCCs) obtained from postnatal mice to assess the toxic effect of the Abeta oligomer 1-40 (Abeta1-40) after propidium iodide uptake in vitro. Our results demonstrate that NGCCs, which are primarily composed of CGCs, are resistant to Abeta1-40 challenge (5-10 muM) when cultured in physiological (5 mM) extracellular KCl ([K+]e) concentrations, i.e., in a condition in which CGCs undergo full maturation. Conversely, when 10 muM Abeta1-40 is given to NGCCs cultured in elevated (25 mM) [K+]e (and thus maintained in an immature state), there is a statistically significant increase in cell death. Cell death is by apoptosis, as demonstrated by ultrastructural examination. OCCs are resistant to Abeta challenge in any of the conditions tested (variation of [K+]e, presence or absence of serum, or addition of the neprilysin blocker phosphoramidon). Altogether these observations lead us to conclude that cerebellar cells in an organotypic context may be less susceptible to damage by Abeta, raising the question whether isolated CGCs are a reliable assay in drug discovery studies of AD.

22391220|t|ABCG2- and ABCG4-mediated efflux of amyloid-beta peptide 1-40 at the mouse blood-brain barrier.
22391220|a|The accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) in the brain is a critical hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. This high cerebral Abeta concentration may be partly caused by impaired clearance of Abeta across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1) and the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein) are involved in the efflux of Abeta across the BBB. We hypothesized that other ABC proteins, such as members of the G subfamily, are also involved in the BBB clearance of Abeta. We therefore investigated the roles of ABCG2 (BCRP) and ABCG4 in the efflux of [3H] Abeta1-40 from HEK293 cells stably transfected with human ABCG2 or mouse abcg4. We showed that ABCG2 and Abcg4 mediate the cellular efflux of [3H] Abeta1-40. In addition, probucol fully inhibited the efflux of [3H] Abeta1-40 from HEK293-abcg4 cells. Using the in situ brain perfusion technique, we showed that GF120918 (dual inhibitor of Abcb1 and Abcg2) strongly enhanced the uptake (Clup, mul/g/s) of [3H] Abeta1-40 by the brains of Abcb1-deficient mice, but not by the brains of Abcb1/Abcg2-deficient mice, suggesting that Abcg2 is involved in the transport of Abeta at the mouse BBB. Perfusing the brains of Abcb1/Abcg2- and Abca1-deficient mice with [3H] Abeta1-40 plus probucol significantly increased the Clup of Abeta. This suggests that a probucol-sensitive transporter that is different from Abca1, Abcb1, and Abcg2 is involved in the brain efflux of Abeta. We suggest that this probucol-sensitive transporter is Abcg4. We conclude that Abcg4 acts in concert with Abcg2 to efflux Abeta from the brain across the BBB.

22392902|t|Midlife blood pressure, plasma beta-amyloid, and the risk for Alzheimer disease: the Honolulu Asia Aging Study.
22392902|a|beta-Amyloid (Abeta), a vasoactive protein, and elevated blood pressure (BP) levels are associated with Alzheimer disease (AD) and possibly vascular dementia. We investigated the joint association of midlife BP and Abeta peptide levels with the risk for late-life AD and vascular dementia. Subjects were 667 Japanese-American men (including 73 with a brain autopsy), from the prospective Honolulu Heart Program/Honolulu Asia Aging Study (1965-2000). Midlife BP was measured starting in 1971 in participants with a mean age of 58 years; Abeta was measured in specimens collected in 1980-1982, and assessment of dementia and autopsy collection started in 1991-1993. The outcome measures were prevalent (present in 1991-1993) and incident AD (n=53, including 38 with no contributing cardiovascular disease) and vascular dementia (n=24). Cerebral amyloid angiopathy, beta-amyloid neuritic plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles were evaluated in postmortem tissue. The risk for AD significantly increased with lower levels of plasma Abeta (Abeta1-40 hazard ratio: 2.1 [95% CI: 1.4 to 3.1]; Abeta1-42 hazard ratio: 1.6 [95% CI: 1.1 to 2.3]). Evidence of interaction between diastolic BP and plasma Abeta (1-40 P(interaction)<0.05; 1-42 P(interaction)<0.07) levels indicated that the Abeta-related risk for AD was higher when BP was higher. Low plasma Abeta was associated with the presence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (P(trend)<0.05) but not the other neuropathologies. Abeta plasma levels start decreasing >=15 years before AD is diagnosed, and the association of Abeta to AD is modulated by midlife diastolic BP. Elevated BP may compromise vascular integrity leading to cerebral amyloid angiopathy and impaired Abeta clearance from the brain.

22393064|a|Cerebral deposition of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) is an invariant feature of Alzheimer disease (AD), and epidemiological evidence suggests that moderate consumption of foods enriched with phenolic compounds reduce the incidence of AD. We reported previously that the phenolic compounds myricetin (Myr) and rosmarinic acid (RA) inhibited Abeta aggregation in vitro and in vivo. To elucidate a mechanistic basis for these results, we analyzed the effects of five phenolic compounds in the Abeta aggregation process and in oligomer-induced synaptic toxicities. We now report that the phenolic compounds blocked Abeta oligomerization, and Myr promoted significant NMR chemical shift changes of monomeric Abeta. Both Myr and RA reduced cellular toxicity and synaptic dysfunction of the Abeta oligomers. These results suggest that Myr and RA may play key roles in blocking the toxicity and early assembly processes associated with Abeta through different binding.

22393530|t|Apolipoprotein E and apolipoprotein E receptors: normal biology and roles in Alzheimer disease.
22393530|a|Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype is the major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD); the epsilon4 allele increases risk and the epsilon2 allele is protective. In the central nervous system (CNS), apoE is produced by glial cells, is present in high-density-like lipoproteins, interacts with several receptors that are members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family, and is a protein that binds to the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide. There are a variety of mechanisms by which apoE isoform may influence risk for AD. There is substantial evidence that differential effects of apoE isoform on AD risk are influenced by the ability of apoE to affect Abeta aggregation and clearance in the brain. Other mechanisms are also likely to play a role in the ability of apoE to influence CNS function as well as AD, including effects on synaptic plasticity, cell signaling, lipid transport and metabolism, and neuroinflammation. ApoE receptors, including LDLRs, Apoer2, very low-density lipoprotein receptors (VLDLRs), and lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) appear to influence both the CNS effects of apoE as well as Abeta metabolism and toxicity. Therapeutic strategies based on apoE and apoE receptors may include influencing apoE/Abeta interactions, apoE structure, apoE lipidation, LDLR receptor family member function, and signaling. Understanding the normal and disease-related biology connecting apoE, apoE receptors, and AD is likely to provide novel insights into AD pathogenesis and treatment.

22397651|t|Donepezil and memantine for moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease.
22397651|a|BACKGROUND: Clinical trials have shown the benefits of cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. It is not known whether treatment benefits continue after the progression to moderate-to-severe disease. METHODS: We assigned 295 community-dwelling patients who had been treated with donepezil for at least 3 months and who had moderate or severe Alzheimer's disease (a score of 5 to 13 on the Standardized Mini-Mental State Examination [SMMSE, on which scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function]) to continue donepezil, discontinue donepezil, discontinue donepezil and start memantine, or continue donepezil and start memantine. Patients received the study treatment for 52 weeks. The coprimary outcomes were scores on the SMMSE and on the Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale (BADLS, on which scores range from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating greater impairment). The minimum clinically important differences were 1.4 points on the SMMSE and 3.5 points on the BADLS. RESULTS: Patients assigned to continue donepezil, as compared with those assigned to discontinue donepezil, had a score on the SMMSE that was higher by an average of 1.9 points (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 2.5) and a score on the BADLS that was lower (indicating less impairment) by 3.0 points (95% CI, 1.8 to 4.3) (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Patients assigned to receive memantine, as compared with those assigned to receive memantine placebo, had a score on the SMMSE that was an average of 1.2 points higher (95% CI, 0.6 to 1.8; P<0.001) and a score on the BADLS that was 1.5 points lower (95% CI, 0.3 to 2.8; P=0.02). The efficacy of donepezil and of memantine did not differ significantly in the presence or absence of the other. There were no significant benefits of the combination of donepezil and memantine over donepezil alone. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with moderate or severe Alzheimer's disease, continued treatment with donepezil was associated with cognitive benefits that exceeded the minimum clinically important difference and with significant functional benefits over the course of 12 months.

22398375|t|Toward a dynamic biomarker model in Alzheimer's disease.
22398375|a|Biomarkers, both biological and imaging, are indicators of specific changes that characterize Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression in vivo. Knowing the precise relationship between biomarkers and disease severity would allow for accurate disease staging and possible forecasting of decline. Jack et al. suggested as an initial hypothesis that this relationship be sigmoidal; the objective of this article is to determine, using large-scale population data from ADNI, the precise shape of this association. We considered six different models (linear; quadratic; robust quadratic; local quadratic regression; penalized B-spline; and sigmoid) and used the Akaike Information Criterion to gauge how well these models compare in conforming to the data. We included 576 subjects (229 controls, 193 AD, and 154 mild cognitive impairment subjects who converted to AD) from the ADNI study, for whom baseline data on cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta (Abeta)42, phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and total-tau (t-tau), hippocampal volumes, and FDG-PET were available. Analysis of this cross-sectional dataset showed that a local quadratic regression model was 42% more likely than a sigmoid to be the best model for Abeta42. This ratio augments to 22% and 73% for Penalized B-Spline in the case of p-tau and t-tau, respectively; to 3500% for the linear model for FDG-PET; and to 6700% for the Penalized B-Spline for hippocampal volumes. Preliminary, cross-sectional evidence therefore indicates that the shape of the association with disease severity is non-linear and differs between biomarkers.

22398376|t|Amyloid-beta25-35 induces apolipoprotein D Synthesis and growth arrest in HT22 hippocampal cells.
22398376|a|Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) is a secreted glycoprotein that is markedly induced in several pathological and stressful conditions in the nervous system. In the central nervous system, ApoD expression is upregulated during aging, after traumatic brain injury, and in several human neuropathologies such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), where it is found associated with amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques. Recent studies have indicated that ApoD has an important function as a neuroprotective and antioxidant protein. The aim of this work is to study the effect of the peptide fragment Abeta25-35, which is believed to play a major role in the neurodegenerative process of AD, in ApoD expression in a mouse hippocampal cell line. In addition, we studied whether direct addition of exogenous human recombinant ApoD protein has neuroprotective effect against Abeta25-35 treatment on neuronal cells. Our results demonstrate that Abeta25-35 induces ApoD expression in hippocampal cells in response to stress-induced growth arrest. This observed relationship between Abeta and ApoD expression could explain the elevated levels of ApoD found in AD brain, where it may be a neuroprotective molecule in the course of AD, probably related to its lipid transport function or a direct antioxidant property. However, the addition of exogenous human recombinant ApoD does not exert any protective effect, most likely due to its major structural modifications.

22398958|t|Comparison of 11C-PiB and 18F-florbetaben for Abeta imaging in ageing and Alzheimer's disease.
22398958|a|PURPOSE: Amyloid imaging with (18)F-labelled radiotracers will allow widespread use of this technique, facilitating research, diagnosis and therapeutic development for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The purpose of this analysis was to compare data on cortical Abeta deposition in subjects who had undergone both (11)C-PiB (PiB) and (18)F-florbetaben (FBB) PET imaging. METHODS: We identified ten healthy elderly controls (HC) and ten patients with AD who had undergone PET imaging after intravenous injection of 370 MBq of PiB and 300 MBq of FBB under separate research protocols. PiB and FBB images were coregistered so that placement of regions of interest was identical on both scans and standard uptake value ratios (SUVR) using the cerebellar cortex as reference region were calculated between 40 and 70 min and between 90 and 110 min after injection for PiB and FBB, respectively. RESULTS: Significantly higher SUVR values (p < 0.0001) in most cortical areas were observed in AD patients when compared with HC with both radiotracers. Global SUVR values in AD patients were on average 75% higher than in HC with PiB and 56% higher with FBB. There was an excellent linear correlation between PiB and FBB global SUVR values (r = 0.97, p < 0.0001) with similar effect sizes for distinguishing AD from HC subjects for both radiotracers (Cohen's d 3.3 for PiB and 3.0 for FBB). CONCLUSION: FBB, while having a narrower dynamic range than PiB, clearly distinguished HC from AD patients, with a comparable effect size. FBB seems a suitable (18)F radiotracer for imaging AD pathology in vivo.

22399757|t|FBL2 regulates amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism by promoting ubiquitination-dependent APP degradation and inhibition of APP endocytosis.
22399757|a|The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is a major protein degradation pathway whose dysfunction is now widely accepted as a cause of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Here we demonstrate that the F-box and leucine rich repeat protein2 (FBL2), a component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, regulates amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism through APP ubiquitination. FBL2 overexpression decreased the amount of secreted amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides and sAPPbeta, whereas FBL2 mRNA knockdown by siRNA increased these levels. FBL2 overexpression also decreased the amount of intracellular Abeta in Neuro2a cells stably expressing APP with Swedish mutation. FBL2 bound with APP specifically at its C-terminal fragment (CTF), which promoted APP/CTF ubiquitination. FBL2 overexpression also accelerated APP proteasome-dependent degradation and decreased APP protein localization in lipid rafts by inhibiting endocytosis. These effects were not observed in an F-box-deleted FBL2 mutant that does not participate in the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Furthermore, a reduced insoluble Abeta and Abeta plaque burden was observed in the hippocampus of 7-month-old FBL2 transgenic mice crossed with double-transgenic mice harboring APPswe and PS1(M146V) transgenes. These findings indicate that FBL2 is a novel and dual regulator of APP metabolism through FBL2-dependent ubiquitination of APP.

22399772|t|The secreted Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-1 is required for amyloid beta-mediated synaptic loss.
22399772|a|Extensive evidence supports a central role for amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Synaptic loss mediated by Abeta in early stages of the disease might contribute to cognitive impairments. However, little is known about the mechanism by which Abeta induces the loss of synapses. The expression of the Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1) is increased in brains of AD patients and in AD transgenic mouse models, suggesting that dysfunction of Wnt signaling could contribute to AD pathology. Here we report that acute exposure to Abeta oligomers induces Dkk1 expression together with the loss of synaptic sites. Importantly, Dkk1-neutralizing antibodies suppress Abeta-induced synapse loss in mouse brain slices. In mature rat hippocampal neurons, Dkk1 decreases the number of synapses without affecting cell viability. Ultrastructural analyses revealed that Wnt blockade decreases the size of presynaptic and postsynaptic terminals. Time-lapse recordings of RFP-labeled stable synaptic sites demonstrate that Dkk1 induces the dispersal of synaptic components. These findings identify Dkk1 as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of AD.

22401905|t|Intraneuronal Abeta accumulation and neurodegeneration: lessons from transgenic models.
22401905|a|AIMS: In the present review we summarize current knowledge on the concept of intraneuronal Abeta as a determinant for neuron loss and other pathological alterations in transgenic models for Alzheimer disease. MAIN METHODS: We discuss the use of transgenic mouse and non-vertebrate transgenic models accumulating intracellular Abeta peptides and their impact on the ongoing discussion. KEY FINDINGS: Intraneuronal Abeta accumulation in transgenic models is intimately linked to pathological alterations including neuron loss. One of the technical caveats for visualizing intraneuronal Abeta is the antibody used to unequivocally demonstrate its presence. Very often antibodies were used that recognize both Abeta and APP, leading to false positive results due to misinterpretation. SIGNIFICANCE: Whereas a clear relationship between intraneuronal Abeta accumulation and neuron loss is evident in transgenic mouse models it remains an unresolved issue whether the concept of intraneuronal Abeta can be integrated into the human pathology as well.

22402435|t|Estrogen activates matrix metalloproteinases-2 and -9 to increase beta amyloid degradation.
22402435|a|Estrogen is known to affect different aspects of beta-amyloid (Abeta) synthesis and degradation. The present work was undertaken to evaluate specifically whether matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) -2 and -9 are involved in Abeta degradation induced by estrogen and whether this is relevant to estrogen-induced neuroprotection. In SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells, 10 nM 17beta-estradiol (17beta-E2) increases mRNA and intracellular protein expression of MMP-2 and -9, as well as the levels of the active forms of both enzymes released in the medium. Specificity of the effect is proved by prevention with the estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist ICI 182,780 (1 muM) and involvement of the ERalpha subtype is confirmed by the use of selective ERalpha or ERbeta agonists (PPT, DPN) and antagonists (MPP, PHTPP). 17beta-E2 significantly increases the degradation of Abeta, either transferred with the conditioned medium of H4-APPSw human neuroglioma cells, engineered to overproduce Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42), or exogenously added as 2 muM Abeta(1-42). Both these effects are completely prevented by preexposure to the broad spectrum MMP inhibitor GM6001 (5 muM). Importantly, the 17beta-E2-induced rescue of neuroblastoma cells challenged with 2 muM Abeta(1-42), an effect prevented by ICI 182,780 (1 muM), is mediated by MMPs, as it appears significantly reduced by GM6001 (5 muM) as well as by both MMP-2 (200 nM) and MMP-9 (200nM) selective inhibitors. In conclusion, the present study shows for the first time that MMP-2 and -9 give a main contribution to estrogen's neuroprotective effect.

22402892|t|Cerebrospinal fluid levels of Abeta42 relationship with cholinergic cortical activity in Alzheimer's disease patients.
22402892|a|The dysfunction of cholinergic neurons is a typical hallmark in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In animal models of AD, fragments of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) and Tau protein are thought to interfere with central cholinergic transmission, specifically with synthesis and release of acetylcholine. Thus, we aimed to investigate whether the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of Abeta42 and Tau proteins in AD patients could influence physiological central cholinergic activity. In AD patients (n = 19), central cholinergic function was evaluated in vivo by using short afferent latency inhibition (SLAI), and compared to age-matched healthy controls. In the same AD patients, CSF samples were collected through lumbar puncture to obtain individual levels of Abeta42, total Tau (t-Tau) and phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) (Thr181). SLAI was decreased in AD patients in comparison to age-matched healthy controls. We found that in patients there was a negative correlation between the individual amount of cholinergic activity assessed by SLAI and the CSF levels of Abeta42. On the other hand, there was a positive correlation between the levels of SLAI and CSF p-Tau. No correlation was found when SLAI was analysed together with t-Tau. These results demonstrate that mechanisms of cortical cholinergic activity are altered in patients bearing a pathological CSF hallmark of AD, suggesting that these peptides may have some influence on the cholinergic dysfunction in AD. We suggest that coupling of CSF biomarkers with neurophysiological parameters of central cholinergic function could be important to better detect ongoing mechanisms of neural degeneration in vivo.

22403062|t|Antiparallel beta-sheet architecture in Iowa-mutant beta-amyloid fibrils.
22403062|a|Wild-type, full-length (40- and 42-residue) amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) fibrils have been shown by a variety of magnetic resonance techniques to contain cross-beta structures in which the beta-sheets have an in-register parallel supramolecular organization. In contrast, recent studies of fibrils formed in vitro by the Asp23-to-Asn mutant of 40-residue Abeta (D23N-Abeta(1-40)), which is associated with early onset neurodegeneration, indicate that D23N-Abeta(1-40) fibrils can contain either parallel or antiparallel beta-sheets. We report a protocol for producing structurally pure antiparallel D23N-Abeta(1-40) fibril samples and a series of solid state nuclear magnetic resonance and electron microscopy measurements that lead to a specific model for the antiparallel D23N-Abeta(1-40) fibril structure. This model reveals how both parallel and antiparallel cross-beta structures can be constructed from similar peptide monomer conformations and stabilized by similar sets of interactions, primarily hydrophobic in nature. We find that antiparallel D23N-Abeta(1-40) fibrils are thermodynamically metastable with respect to conversion to parallel structures, propagate less efficiently than parallel fibrils in seeded fibril growth, and therefore must nucleate more efficiently than parallel fibrils in order to be observable. Experiments in neuronal cell cultures indicate that both antiparallel and parallel D23N-Abeta(1-40) fibrils are cytotoxic. Thus, our antiparallel D23N-Abeta(1-40) fibril model represents a specific "toxic intermediate" in the aggregation process of a disease-associated Abeta mutant.

22403391|t|Atomic view of a toxic amyloid small oligomer.
22403391|a|Amyloid diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and the prion conditions, are each associated with a particular protein in fibrillar form. These amyloid fibrils were long suspected to be the disease agents, but evidence suggests that smaller, often transient and polymorphic oligomers are the toxic entities. Here, we identify a segment of the amyloid-forming protein alphaB crystallin, which forms an oligomeric complex exhibiting properties of other amyloid oligomers: beta-sheet-rich structure, cytotoxicity, and recognition by an oligomer-specific antibody. The x-ray-derived atomic structure of the oligomer reveals a cylindrical barrel, formed from six antiparallel protein strands, that we term a cylindrin. The cylindrin structure is compatible with a sequence segment from the beta-amyloid protein of Alzheimer's disease. Cylindrins offer models for the hitherto elusive structures of amyloid oligomers.

22404518|t|Involvement of the gamma-secretase-mediated EphA4 signaling pathway in synaptic pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
22404518|a|Loss of synapses is associated with cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the molecular mechanism underlying this synaptic impairment is not well understood. EphA4 is a substrate of gamma-secretase, and the gamma-secretase-cleaved EphA4 intracellular domain (EICD) is known to enhance the formation of dendritic spines via activation of the Rac signaling pathway. Here, we show that the amount of Rac1 is significantly reduced, and correlated with the level of EICD in the frontal lobes of AD patients. Biochemical analyses revealed that the amount of membrane-associated EICD was decreased and strongly correlated with the level of membrane-associated Rac1, which is considered to be active Rac1. The synaptic scaffolding protein, postsynaptic density (PSD)-95, was specifically decreased in AD, and the amount of PSD-95 correlated with the level of Rac1. Moreover, the amounts of Rac1 and PSD-95 were negatively correlated with the extent of tau phosphorylation, which is crucial for neurofibrillary tangle formation. These results suggest that attenuation of the EICD-mediated Rac signaling pathway is involved in the synaptic pathogenesis of AD.

22404891|t|Oxidative lipid modification of nicastrin enhances amyloidogenic gamma-secretase activity in Alzheimer's disease.
22404891|a|The cause of elevated level of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta42) in common late-onset sporadic [Alzheimer's disease (AD)] has not been established. Here, we show that the membrane lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) is associated with amyloid and neurodegenerative pathologies in AD and that it enhances gamma-secretase activity and Abeta42 production in neurons. The gamma-secretase substrate receptor, nicastrin, was found to be modified by HNE in cultured neurons and in brain specimens from patients with AD, in which HNE-nicastrin levels were found to be correlated with increased gamma-secretase activity and Abeta plaque burden. Furthermore, HNE modification of nicastrin enhanced its binding to the gamma-secretase substrate, amyloid precursor protein (APP) C99. In addition, the stimulation of gamma-secretase activity and Abeta42 production by HNE were blocked by an HNE-scavenging histidine analog in a 3xTgAD mouse model of AD. These findings suggest a specific molecular mechanism by which oxidative stress increases Abeta42 production in AD and identify HNE as a novel therapeutic target upstream of the gamma-secretase cleavage of APP.

22405265|t|Liraglutide in oral antidiabetic drug combination therapy.
22405265|a|The glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist liraglutide is indicated as an add-on to oral antidiabetic drug regimens in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Herein, the results of clinical trials assessing the efficacy, safety and tolerability of liraglutide when used in combination with either one or two oral antidiabetic therapies are summarised, then contrasted with the effects of exenatide and dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP-4) inhibitors. GLP-1 receptor agonists lead to effective glycaemic control when used as combination therapy with either one or two oral antidiabetic agents, and may confer overall benefits in weight loss and blood pressure in some subjects. These agents are well tolerated; the most commonly reported adverse effect is mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal symptoms, which are usually transient. Rates of hypoglycaemia in these trials were low, although higher rates were noted when combined with a sulphonylurea. While further study will be required, GLP-1 receptor agonists may offer important advantages over other diabetic therapies, including DPP-4 inhibitors.

22406440|t|Deferiprone reduces amyloid-beta and tau phosphorylation levels but not reactive oxygen species generation in hippocampus of rabbits fed a cholesterol-enriched diet.
22406440|a|Accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide and the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein are major hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The causes of AD are not well known but a number of environmental and dietary factors are suggested to increase the risk of developing AD. Additionally, altered metabolism of iron may have a role in the pathogenesis of AD. We have previously demonstrated that cholesterol-enriched diet causes AD-like pathology with iron deposition in rabbit brain. However, the extent to which chelation of iron protects against this pathology has not been determined. In this study, we administered the iron chelator deferiprone in drinking water to rabbits fed with a 2% cholesterol diet for 12 weeks. We found that deferiprone (both at 10 and 50 mg/kg/day) significantly decreased levels of Abeta40 and Abeta42 as well as BACE1, the enzyme that initiates cleavage of amyloid-beta protein precursor to yield Abeta. Deferiprone also reduced the cholesterol diet-induced increase in phosphorylation of tau but failed to reduce reactive oxygen species generation. While deferiprone treatment was not associated with any change in brain iron levels, it was associated with a significant reduction in plasma iron and cholesterol levels. These results demonstrate that deferiprone confers important protection against hypercholesterolemia-induced AD pathology but the mechanism(s) may involve reduction in plasma iron and cholesterol levels rather than chelation of brain iron. We propose that adding an antioxidant therapy to deferiprone may be necessary to fully protect against cholesterol-enriched diet-induced AD-like pathology.

22406445|t|Systematic evaluation of magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy techniques for imaging a transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease (AbetaPP/PS1).
22406445|a|Murine models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) provide means to detect and follow biomarker changes similar to those observed in humans. Non-invasive biomarkers, such as those provided by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) methods are highly desirable, however, systematic studies of in vivo MRI/MRS methods to characterize the cerebral morphology and metabolic pattern of these mice remain scarce. We investigated sixteen consecutive slices from the brain of wild-type and AbetaPP/PS1 mice, obtaining a collection of T2 weighted, diffusion weighted and magnetization transfer weighted images as well as 1H PRESS spectra from the cortical and subcortical areas. Compared to controls, AbetaPP/PS1 mice show significant regional hyperintensities in T2 weighted images of the cerebral cortex, significant ventricular enlargement, and decreased hippocampal area and fractional magnetization transfer. MRS demonstrated an increase in the ratio of choline (Cho) to creatine (Cr) in the cortical and subcortical areas of the transgenic animals. A logistic regression classifier was implemented considering all parameters investigated, and revealed the most characteristic changes and allowed for the correct classification of control and AbetaPP/PS1 mice. In summary, the present results provide a useful frame to evaluate optimal MRI/MRS biomarkers for the characterization of AD models, potentially applicable in drug discovery processes, because of their non-invasive and repeatable nature in longitudinal studies.

22406446|t|Amyloid-beta metabolite sensing: biochemical linking of glycation modification and misfolding.
22406446|a|Glycation is the reaction of a reducing sugar with proteins and lipids, resulting in myriads of glycation products, protein modifications, cross-linking, and oxidative stress. Glycation reactions are also elevated during metabolic dysfunction such as in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Down's syndrome. These reactions increase the misfolding of the proteins such as tau and amyloid-beta (Abeta), and colocalize with amyloid plaques in AD. Thus, glycation links metabolic dysfunction and AD and may have a causal role in AD. We have characterized the reaction of Abeta with reactive metabolites that are elevated during metabolic dysfunction. One metabolite, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, is a normal product of glycolysis, while the others are associated with pathology. Our data demonstrates that lipid oxidation products malondialdehyde, hydroxynonenal, and glycation metabolites (methylglyoxal, glyceraldehyde, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate) modify Abeta42 and increase misfolding. Using mass spectrometry, modifications primarily occurred at the amino terminus. However, the metabolite methylglyoxal modified Arg5 in the Abeta sequence. 4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal modifications were similar to our previous publication. To place such modifications into an in vivo context, we stained AD brain tissue for endproducts of glycation, or advanced glycation endproducts (AGE). Similar to previous findings, AGE colocalized with amyloid plaques. In summary, we demonstrate the glycation of Abeta and plaques by metabolic compounds. Thus, glycation potentially links metabolic dysfunction and Abeta misfolding in AD, and may contribute to the AD pathogenesis. This association can further be expanded to raise the tantalizing concept that such Abeta modification and misfolding can function as a sensor of metabolic dysfunction.

22406447|t|Evidence that the amyloid-beta protein precursor intracellular domain, AICD, derives from beta-secretase-generated C-terminal fragment.
22406447|a|One of the major pathological hallmarks of brains affected with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the senile plaque, an extracellular deposit mainly composed of a set of highly insoluble peptides of various lengths (39-43 amino acids) referred to as amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides. Abeta peptides are derived from combined proteolytic cleavages undergone on the amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) by a set of enzymes called secretases. Several lines of anatomical and biological evidence suggest that Abeta peptides would not account for all pathological stigmata and molecular dysfunctions taking place in AD. In amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic pathways, AbetaPP first undergoes beta- or alpha-secretases-mediated cleavages yielding C99 and C83, respectively. These two membrane-embedded C-terminal fragments are both potential targets of subsequent gamma-secretase-mediated proteolysis. The latter cleavage not only generates either p3 or Abeta peptides but similarly gives rise to an AbetaPP IntraCellular Domain (AICD fragment) that could modulate the transcription of several genes linked to AD pathology. It is therefore striking that AICD theoretically derives from both amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic AbetaPP processing pathways. Here we show that AICD predominantly derives from C99 by means of recombinant substrates and transiently transfected cells expressing C99. Our data suggest a preferred pathogenic pathway for AICD production and suggests that this fragment, in addition to C99 and Abeta peptides, could contribute to AD pathology.

22406537|t|A multimodal RAGE-specific inhibitor reduces amyloid beta-mediated brain disorder in a mouse model of Alzheimer disease.
22406537|a|In Alzheimer disease (AD), amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) accumulates in plaques in the brain. Receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) mediates Abeta-induced perturbations in cerebral vessels, neurons, and microglia in AD. Here, we identified a high-affinity RAGE-specific inhibitor (FPS-ZM1) that blocked Abeta binding to the V domain of RAGE and inhibited Abeta40- and Abeta42-induced cellular stress in RAGE-expressing cells in vitro and in the mouse brain in vivo. FPS-ZM1 was nontoxic to mice and readily crossed the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In aged APPsw/0 mice overexpressing human Abeta-precursor protein, a transgenic mouse model of AD with established Abeta pathology, FPS-ZM1 inhibited RAGE-mediated influx of circulating Abeta40 and Abeta42 into the brain. In brain, FPS-ZM1 bound exclusively to RAGE, which inhibited beta-secretase activity and Abeta production and suppressed microglia activation and the neuroinflammatory response. Blockade of RAGE actions at the BBB and in the brain reduced Abeta40 and Abeta42 levels in brain markedly and normalized cognitive performance and cerebral blood flow responses in aged APPsw/0 mice. Our data suggest that FPS-ZM1 is a potent multimodal RAGE blocker that effectively controls progression of Abeta-mediated brain disorder and that it may have the potential to be a disease-modifying agent for AD.

22409719|t|Distinct dimerization for various alloforms of the amyloid-beta protein: Abeta(1-40), Abeta(1-42), and Abeta(1-40)(D23N).
22409719|a|The Amyloid-beta protein is related to Alzheimer's disease, and various experiments have shown that oligomers as small as the dimer are cytotoxic. Two alloforms are mainly produced: Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42). They have very different oligomer distributions, and it was recently suggested, from experimental studies, that this variation may originate from structural differences in their dimer structures. Little structural information is available on the Abeta dimer, however, and to complement experimental observations, we simulated the folding of the wild-type Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) dimers as well as the mutated Abeta(1-40)(D23N) dimer using an accurate coarse-grained force field coupled to Hamiltonian-temperature replica exchange molecular dynamics. The D23N variant impedes the salt-bridge formation between D23 and K28 seen in the wild-type Abeta, leading to very different fibrillation properties and final amyloid fibrils. Our results show that the Abeta(1-42) dimer has a higher propensity than the Abeta(1-40) dimer to form beta-strands at the central hydrophobic core (residues 17-21) and at the C-terminal (residues 30-42), which are two segments crucial to the oligomerization of Abeta. The free energy landscape of the Abeta(1-42) dimer is also broader and more complex than that of the Abeta(1-40) dimer. Interestingly, D23N also impacts the free energy landscape by increasing the population of configurations with higher beta-strand propensities when compared against Abeta(40). In addition, while Abeta(1-40)(D23N) displays a higher beta-strand propensity at the C-terminal, its solvent accessibility does not change with respect to the wild-type sequence. Overall, our results show the strong impact of the two amino acids Ile41-Ala42 and the salt-bridge D23-K28 on the folding of the Abeta dimer.

22409939|t|Shapes of the trajectories of 5 major biomarkers of Alzheimer disease.
22409939|a|OBJECTIVE: To characterize the shape of the trajectories of Alzheimer disease biomarkers as a function of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. DESIGN AND SETTING: Longitudinal registries from the Mayo Clinic and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. PATIENTS: Two different samples (n = 343 and n = 598) were created that spanned the cognitive spectrum from normal to Alzheimer disease dementia. Subgroup analyses were performed in members of both cohorts (n = 243 and n = 328) who were amyloid positive at baseline. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The shape of biomarker trajectories as a function of MMSE score, adjusted for age, was modeled and described as baseline (cross-sectional) and within-subject longitudinal effects. Biomarkers evaluated were cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta42 and tau levels, amyloid and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography imaging, and structural magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Baseline biomarker values generally worsened (ie, nonzero slope) with lower baseline MMSE score. Baseline hippocampal volume, amyloid positron emission tomography, and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography values plateaued (ie, nonlinear slope) with lower MMSE score in 1 or more analyses. Longitudinally, within-subject rates of biomarker change were associated with worsening MMSE score. Nonconstant within-subject rates (deceleration) of biomarker change were found in only 1 model. CONCLUSIONS: Biomarker trajectory shapes by MMSE score were complex and were affected by interactions with age and APOE status. Nonlinearity was found in several baseline effects models. Nonconstant within-subject rates of biomarker change were found in only 1 model, likely owing to limited within-subject longitudinal follow-up. Creating reliable models that describe the full trajectories of Alzheimer disease biomarkers will require significant additional longitudinal data in individual participants.

22410582|t|Modifiable factors that alter the size of the hippocampus with ageing.
22410582|a|The hippocampus is particularly vulnerable to the neurotoxic effects of obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypoxic brain injury, obstructive sleep apnoea, bipolar disorder, clinical depression and head trauma. Patients with these conditions often have smaller hippocampi and experience a greater degree of cognitive decline than individuals without these comorbidities. Moreover, hippocampal atrophy is an established indicator for conversion from the normal ageing process to developing mild cognitive impairment and dementia. As such, an important aim is to ascertain which modifiable factors can have a positive effect on the size of the hippocampus throughout life. Observational studies and preliminary clinical trials have raised the possibility that physical exercise, cognitive stimulation and treatment of general medical conditions can reverse age-related atrophy in the hippocampus, or even expand its size. An emerging concept--the dynamic polygon hypothesis--suggests that treatment of modifiable risk factors can increase the volume or prevent atrophy of the hippocampus. According to this hypothesis, a multidisciplinary approach, which involves strategies to both reduce neurotoxicity and increase neurogenesis, is likely to be successful in delaying the onset of cognitive impairment with ageing. Further research on the constellation of interventions that could be most effective is needed before recommendations can be made for implementing preventive and therapeutic strategies.

22410648|t|White matter hyperintensities predict amyloid increase in Alzheimer's disease.
22410648|a|Impaired amyloid clearance probably contributes to increased amyloid deposition in sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Diminished perivascular drainage due to cerebral small-vessel disease (CSVD) has been proposed as a cause of reduced amyloid clearance. White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are considered to reflect CSVD and can be measured using fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Amyloid deposition can be determined in vivo using Pittsburgh compound B ([11C]PiB) positron emission tomography (PET). We aimed to elucidate the association between WMH and the progression of amyloid deposition in patients with AD. Twenty-two patients with probable AD underwent FLAIR-MRI and [11C]PiB-PET examinations at baseline (BL) and after a mean follow-up (FU) interval of 28 months. The relationship between BL-WMH and the progression of cerebral amyloid between BL and FU was examined using a regions-of-interest (ROI) approach. The region-specific variability of this relationship was analyzed using a voxel-based method. The longitudinal analysis revealed a statistically significant association between the amount of BL-WMH and the progression of amyloid load between BL and FU (p = 0.006, adjusted R2 = 0.375, standardized coefficient beta = 0.384). The association was particularly observed in parieto-occipital regions and tended to be closer in regions adjacent to the brain surface. According to our knowledge, this is the first in vivo study in human being supporting the hypothesis that impaired amyloid clearance along perivascular drainage pathways may contribute to beta-amyloid deposition in sporadic AD. The extent of WMH might be a relevant factor to be assessed in antiamyloid drug trials.

22412769|t|A comparison of midazolam and clonidine as an oral premedication in pediatric patients.
22412769|a|BACKGROUND: To compare oral midazolam (0.5 mg/kg) versus oral clonidine (4 mug/kg) as a premedication in pediatric patients aged between 2-12 years with regard to sedation and anxiolysis. METHODS: Sixty pediatric patients belonging to the American Society of Anesthesiologists class I and II between the age group of 2-12 years scheduled for elective surgery were randomly allocated to receive either oral midazolam (group I) 30 min before induction or oral clonidine (group II) 90 min before induction of anesthesia. The children were evaluated for levels of sedation and anxiety at the time of separation from the parents, venepuncture, and at the time of mask application for induction of anesthesia. RESULTS: After premedication, the percentage of children who were sedated and calm increased in both the groups. The overall level of sedation was better in the children in the clonidine group, but children in the midazolam group had a greater degree of anxiolysis at times of venepuncture and mask application. In addition, midazolam did not cause significant changes in hemodynamics unlike clonidine where a significant fall in blood pressure was noted, after premedication, but preinduction. CONCLUSION: We conclude that under the conditions of the study, oral midazolam is superior to clonidine as an anxiolytic in pediatric population. Clonidine with its sedative action especially at the time of separation from parents along with its other perioperative benefits cannot be discounted.

22413858|t|Effects of point substitutions on the structure of toxic Alzheimer's beta-amyloid channels: atomic force microscopy and molecular dynamics simulations.
22413858|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a misfolded protein disease characterized by the accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide as senile plaques, progressive neurodegeneration, and memory loss. Recent evidence suggests that AD pathology is linked to the destabilization of cellular ionic homeostasis mediated by toxic pores made of Abeta peptides. Understanding the exact nature by which these pores conduct electrical and molecular signals could aid in identifying potential therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of AD. Here using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we compared the imaged pore structures with models to predict channel conformations as a function of amino acid sequence. Site-specific amino acid (AA) substitutions in the wild-type Abeta(1-42) peptide yield information regarding the location and significance of individual AA residues to its characteristic structure-activity relationship. We selected two AAs that our MD simulation predicted to inhibit or permit pore conductance. The substitution of Phe19 with Pro has previously been shown to eliminate conductance in the planar lipid bilayer system. Our MD simulations predict a channel-like shape with a collapsed pore, which is supported by the AFM channel images. We suggest that proline, a known beta-sheet breaker, creates a kink in the center of the pore and prevents conductance via blockage. This residue may be a viable target for drug development studies aiming to inhibit Abeta from inducing ionic destabilization toxicity. The substitution of Phe20 with Cys exhibits pore structures indistinguishable from the wild type in AFM images. MD simulations predict site 20 to face the solvated pore. Overall, the mutations support the previously predicted beta-sheet-based channel structure.

22414570|t|Synergistic effects of antidementia drugs on spatial learning and recall in the APP23 transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
22414570|a|Current treatment of Alzheimer's disease rests on cholinergic and anti-glutamatergic substances. It has been suggested that acetylcholine is required for memory acquisition but is less important for memory retrieval. It was our goal to investigate the effects of treatment with donepezil, memantine, and a combination thereof on spatial memory. We assessed spatial memory of male wild type and B6C3-Tg(APPswe,PSEN1dE9)85Dbo (APP23) transgenic animals in a complex dry-land maze. Animals were treated with donepezil (1 mg/kg) and memantine (10 mg/kg). Total time to escape from the maze decreased in 4.5 month old sham-treated wild-type animals and, to a lesser extent, in APP23 animals. Analysis of time spent moving and resting revealed that the treatment effect is conferred by a reduction of the moving time for donepezil and a reduction of the resting time for memantine. Combination treatment with donepezil and memantine fostered a greater improvement than treatment with either substance alone. We conclude that enhancement of spatial learning in a dry-land maze on cholinergic or anti-glutamatergic treatment is differentially conferred during moving of the animals, possibly reflecting acquisition of spatial information, and resting of the animals, possibly reflecting retrieval of spatial information. Combination treatment with donepezil and memantine exerts a synergistic effect improving both moving time and resting time and thus possibly both spatial learning and retrieval.

22414634|t|Relative equilibrium plot improves graphical analysis and allows bias correction of standardized uptake value ratio in quantitative 11C-PiB PET studies.
22414634|a|UNLABELLED: Both the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) and the Logan plot result in biased distribution volume ratios (DVRs) in ligand-receptor dynamic PET studies. The objective of this study was to use a recently developed relative equilibrium-based graphical (RE) plot method to improve and simplify the 2 commonly used methods for quantification of (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B ((11)C-PiB) PET. METHODS: The overestimation of DVR in SUVR was analyzed theoretically using the Logan and the RE plots. A bias-corrected SUVR (bcSUVR) was derived from the RE plot. Seventy-eight (11)C-PiB dynamic PET scans (66 from controls and 12 from participants with mild cognitive impaired [MCI] from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging) were acquired over 90 min. Regions of interest (ROIs) were defined on coregistered MR images. Both the ROI and the pixelwise time-activity curves were used to evaluate the estimates of DVR. DVRs obtained using the Logan plot applied to ROI time-activity curves were used as a reference for comparison of DVR estimates. RESULTS: Results from the theoretic analysis were confirmed by human studies. ROI estimates from the RE plot and the bcSUVR were nearly identical to those from the Logan plot with ROI time-activity curves. In contrast, ROI estimates from DVR images in frontal, temporal, parietal, and cingulate regions and the striatum were underestimated by the Logan plot (controls, 4%-12%; MCI, 9%-16%) and overestimated by the SUVR (controls, 8%-16%; MCI, 16%-24%). This bias was higher in the MCI group than in controls (P < 0.01) but was not present when data were analyzed using either the RE plot or the bcSUVR. CONCLUSION: The RE plot improves pixelwise quantification of (11)C-PiB dynamic PET, compared with the conventional Logan plot. The bcSUVR results in lower bias and higher consistency of DVR estimates than of SUVR. The RE plot and the bcSUVR are practical quantitative approaches that improve the analysis of (11)C-PiB studies.

22414803|t|Increased Abeta production prompts the onset of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance.
22414803|a|Type 2 diabetes (T2D) mellitus and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are two prevalent diseases with comparable pathophysiological features and genetic predisposition. Patients with AD are more susceptible to develop T2D. However, the molecular mechanism linking AD and T2D remains elusive. In this study, we have generated a new mouse model to test the hypothesis that AD would prompt the onset of T2D in mice. To test our hypothesis, we crossed Alzheimer APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice with mice partially deficient in leptin signaling (db/+). Body weight, plasma glucose, and insulin levels were monitored. Phenotypic characterization of glucose metabolism was performed using glucose and insulin tolerance tests. beta-Cell mass, islet volume, and islet number were analyzed by histomorphometry. APP/PS1 coexpression in mice with intact leptin receptor signaling did not show any metabolic perturbations in glucose metabolism or insulin sensitivity. In contrast, APP/PS1 coexpression in db/+ mice resulted in nonfasting hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypercholesterolemia without changes in body weight. Conversely, fasting blood glucose and cholesterol levels remained unchanged. Coinciding with altered glucose metabolism, APP/PS1 coexpression in db/+ mice resulted in glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and impaired insulin signaling. In addition, histomorphometric analysis of pancreata revealed augmented beta-cell mass. Taken together, these findings provide experimental evidence to support the notion that aberrant Abeta production might be a mechanistic link underlying the pathology of insulin resistance and T2D in AD.

22414817|t|Palmitoylethanolamide protects against the amyloid-beta25-35-induced learning and memory impairment in mice, an experimental model of Alzheimer disease.
22414817|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative dementia. Amyloid-beta deposition, neurofibrillary tangle formation, and neuro-inflammation are the major pathogenic mechanisms that in concert lead to memory dysfunction and decline of cognition. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is the naturally occurring lipid amide between palmitic acid and ethanolamine. Despite its clear role in inflammation and pain control, only limited in vitro evidence exist about a role for PEA in neurodegenerative diseases. Here we describe the neuroprotective activities of PEA in mice injected intracerebroventricularly with amyloid-beta 25-35 (Ab25-35) peptide (9 nmol). We used spatial and non-spatial memory tasks to evaluate learning and memory dysfunctions. Ab25-35 injection significantly impaired spontaneous alternation performances, water maze spatial reference and working-like memory, and novel object recognition test. PEA was administered once a day (3-30 mg/kg, subcutaneously), starting 3 h after Ab25-35, for 1 or 2 weeks. PEA reduced (10 mg/kg) or prevented (30 mg/kg) behavioral impairments induced by Ab25-35 injection. PEA failed to rescue memory deficits induced by Ab25-35 injection in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) null mice. GW7647 (2-(4-(2-(1-cyclohexanebutyl)-3-cyclohexylureido)ethyl)phenylthio)-2-methylpropionic acid; 5 mg/kg per day), a synthetic PPAR-alpha agonist, mimicked the effect of PEA. Acute treatment with PEA was ineffective. According with the neuroprotective profile of PEA observed during behavioral studies, experimental molecular and biochemical markers induced by Ab25-35 injection, such as lipid peroxidation, protein nytrosylation, inducible nitric oxide synthase induction, and caspase3 activation, were reduced by PEA treatment. These data disclose novel findings about the therapeutic potential of PEA, unrevealing a previously unknown therapeutic possibility to treat memory deficits associated with AD.

22418058|t|The effect of ageing on neurogenesis and oxidative stress in the APP(swe)/PS1(deltaE9) mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
22418058|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterised by memory loss and impaired cognitive function. One of the hallmarks of AD is the formation of beta amyloid (Abeta) plaques. Abeta has neurodegenerative properties and aggregates in the brain, causing inflammation, oxidative stress and eventually neuronal loss. In AD, adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus is known to be impaired. We tested how ageing affects neurogenesis and oxidative stress in the commonly used APP(SWE)/PS1(DeltaE9) mouse model of AD and their wild type (wt) littermate controls aged 3, 5, 10 and 15months. Progenitor cell proliferation in the DG of APP/PS1 was lower at 3, 5 and 10months compared to controls, while oxidative stress in APP/PS1 mice was increased in the cortex at 3 and 5months of age compared to controls. The numbers of new neurons in the DG were decreased in APP/PS1 mice at 10 and 15months. In APP/PS1 mice, Abeta plaques were evident in the cortex from 3months onward; however these were small and few. Plaque size and number consistently increased with age in APP/PS1 mice. These results show that the damage to the brain occurs already very early in the brain, and although neurogenesis is impaired, it is still active even in late stage AD. Therefore, therapies would have the best effects if started early, but promoting neurogenesis may act in a protective and reconstructive way even in later stages of AD.

22420626|t|Design of beta-amyloid aggregation inhibitors from a predicted structural motif.
22420626|a|Drug design studies targeting one of the primary toxic agents in Alzheimer's disease, soluble oligomers of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta), have been complicated by the rapid, heterogeneous aggregation of Abeta and the resulting difficulty to structurally characterize the peptide. To address this, we have developed [Nle(35), D-Pro(37)]Abeta(42), a substituted peptide inspired from molecular dynamics simulations which forms structures stable enough to be analyzed by NMR. We report herein that [Nle(35), D-Pro(37)]Abeta(42) stabilizes the trimer and prevents mature fibril and beta-sheet formation. Further, [Nle(35), D-Pro(37)]Abeta(42) interacts with WT Abeta(42) and reduces aggregation levels and fibril formation in mixtures. Using ligand-based drug design based on [Nle(35), D-Pro(37)]Abeta(42), a lead compound was identified with effects on inhibition similar to the peptide. The ability of [Nle(35), D-Pro(37)]Abeta(42) and the compound to inhibit the aggregation of Abeta(42) provides a novel tool to study the structure of Abeta oligomers. More broadly, our data demonstrate how molecular dynamics simulation can guide experiment for further research into AD.

22421275|t|Tuberculosis: the drug development pipeline at a glance.
22421275|a|Tuberculosis is a major disease causing every year 1.8 million deaths worldwide and represents the leading cause of mortality resulting from a bacterial infection. Introduction in the 60's of first-line drug regimen resulted in the control of the disease and TB was perceived as defeating. However, since the progression of HIV leading to co-infection with AIDS and the emergence of drug resistant strains, the need of new anti-tuberculosis drugs was not overstated. However in the past 40 years any new molecule did succeed in reaching the market. Today, the pipeline of potential new treatments has been fulfilled with several compounds in clinical trials or preclinical development with promising activities against sensitive and resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. Compounds as gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, metronidazole or linezolid already used against other bacterial infections are currently evaluated in clinical phases 2 or 3 for treating tuberculosis. In addition, analogues of known TB drugs (PA-824, OPC-67683, PNU-100480, AZD5847, SQ609, SQ109, DC-159a) and new chemical entities (TMC207, BTZ043, DNB1, BDM31343) are under development. In this review, we report the chemical synthesis, mode of action when known, in vitro and in vivo activities and clinical data of all current small molecules targeting tuberculosis.

22422208|t|Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease 1, and related hypomyelinating disorders.
22422208|a|The purpose of this article is to present contemporary information on the clinical and molecular diagnosis and the treatment of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher's disease (PMD) and related leukodystrophies. Various types of mutations of the X-linked proteolipid protein 1 gene (PLP1) that include copy number changes, point mutations, and insertions or deletions of a few bases lead to a clinical spectrum from the most severe connatal PMD, to the least severe spastic paraplegia 2 (SPG2). Signs of PMD include nystagmus, hypotonia, tremors, titubation, ataxia, spasticity, athetotic movements and cognitive impairment; the major findings in SPG2 are leg weakness and spasticity. A diffuse pattern of hypomyelination is seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of PMD/SPG2 patients. A similar constellation of signs and pattern of hypomyelination lead to the autosomal recessive disease called Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease 1 (PMLD1) and the less-severe spastic paraplegia 44 (SPG44), caused by mutations of the gap junction protein, gamma-2 gene (GJC2), formerly known as the gap junction protein, alpha-12 gene (GJA12). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP) may assist with differential clinical diagnosis of PMD and PMLD1. Supportive therapy for patients with PMD/SPG2 and PMLD1/SPG44 includes medications for seizures and spasticity; physical therapy, exercise, and orthotics for spasticity management; surgery for contractures and scoliosis; gastrostomy for severe dysphagia; proper wheelchair seating, physical therapy, and orthotics to prevent or ameliorate the effects of scoliosis; special education; and assistive communication devices.

22422579|t|Protection by cilostazol against amyloid-beta(1-40)-induced suppression of viability and neurite elongation through activation of CK2alpha in HT22 mouse hippocampal cells.
22422579|a|Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) deposits in the brain are critical in the neurotoxicity induced by Abeta. This study elucidates the underlying signaling pathway by which cilostazol protects HT22 neuronal cells from Abeta(1-40) (3-30 muM)-induced deterioration of cell proliferation, viability, and neurite elongation. Cilostazol rescued HT22 cells from the apoptotic cell death induced by Abeta toxicity through the downregulation of phosphorylated p53 (Ser15), Bax, and caspase-3 and the upregulation of Bcl-2 expression, which improved neuronal cell proliferation and viability. Furthermore, Abeta(1-40) suppressed both phosphorylated CK2alpha protein expression and CK2 activity in the cytosol; these were concentration dependently recovered by cilostazol (3-30 muM). Cilostazol significantly increased the levels of GSK-3beta phosphorylation at Ser9 and beta-catenin phosphorylation at Ser675 in the cytosol and nucleus. Cilostazol effects were reversed by KT5720 (1 muM, PKA inhibitor) and TBCA (40 muM, inhibitor of CK2) and CK2alpha knockdown by siRNA transfection. Likewise, Abeta-stimulated GSK-3beta phosphorylation at Tyr 216 was decreased by cilostazol in the control but not in the CK2alpha siRNA-transfected cells. Furthermore, the Abeta (10 muM)-induced suppression of neurite elongation was recovered by cilostazol; this recovery was attenuated by inhibitors such as KT5720 and TBCA and blocked by CK2alpha knockdown. In conclusion, increased cAMP-dependent protein kinase-linked CK2alpha activation underlies the pharmacological effects of cilostazol in downregulating p53 phosphorylation at Ser15 and upregulating GSK-3beta phosphorylation at Ser9/beta-catenin phosphorylation at Ser675, thereby suppressing Abeta(1-40)-induced neurotoxicity and improving neurite elongation.

22423084|t|The microtubule-stabilizing agent, epothilone D, reduces axonal dysfunction, neurotoxicity, cognitive deficits, and Alzheimer-like pathology in an interventional study with aged tau transgenic mice.
22423084|a|Neurodegenerative tauopathies, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), are characterized by insoluble deposits of hyperphosphorylated tau protein within brain neurons. Increased phosphorylation and decreased solubility has been proposed to diminish normal tau stabilization of microtubules (MTs), thereby leading to neuronal dysfunction. Earlier studies have provided evidence that small molecule MT-stabilizing drugs that are used in the treatment of cancer may have utility in the treatment of tauopathies. However, it has not been established whether treatment with a small molecule MT-stabilizing compound will provide benefit in a transgenic model with pre-existing tau pathology, as would be seen in human patients with clinical symptoms. Accordingly, we describe here an interventional study of the brain-penetrant MT-stabilizing agent, epothilone D (EpoD), in aged PS19 mice with existing tau pathology and related behavioral deficits. EpoD treatment reduced axonal dystrophy and increased axonal MT density in the aged PS19 mice, which led to improved fast axonal transport and cognitive performance. Moreover, the EpoD-treated PS19 mice had less forebrain tau pathology and increased hippocampal neuronal integrity, with no dose-limiting side effects. These data reveal that brain-penetrant MT-stabilizing drugs hold promise for the treatment of AD and related tauopathies, and that EpoD could be a candidate for clinical testing.

22423218|t|All-d-Enantiomer of beta-Amyloid Peptide Forms Ion Channels in Lipid Bilayers.
22423218|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of senile dementia in aging populations. Amyloid beta (Abeta)-mediated dysregulation of ionic homeostasis is the prevailing underlying mechanism leading to synaptic degeneration and neuronal death. Abeta-dependent ionic dysregulation most likely occurs either directly via unregulated ionic transport through the membrane or indirectly via Abeta binding to cell membrane receptors and subsequent opening of existing ion channels or transporters. Receptor binding is expected to involve a high degree of stereospecificity. Here, we investigated whether an Abeta peptide enantiomer, whose entire sequence consists of d-amino acids, can form ion-conducting channels; these channels can directly mediate Abeta effects even in the absence of receptor-peptide interactions. Using complementary approaches of planar lipid bilayer (PLB) electrophysiological recordings and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we show that the d-Abeta isomer exhibits ion conductance behavior in the bilayer indistinguishable from that described earlier for the l-Abeta isomer. The d isomer forms channel-like pores with heterogeneous ionic conductance similar to the l-Abeta isomer channels, and the d-isomer channel conductance is blocked by Zn(2+), a known blocker of l-Abeta isomer channels. MD simulations further verify formation of beta-barrel-like Abeta channels with d- and l-isomers, illustrating that both d- and l-Abeta barrels can conduct cations. The calculated values of the single-channel conductance are approximately in the range of the experimental values. These findings are in agreement with amyloids forming Ca(2+) leaking, unregulated channels in AD, and suggest that Abeta toxicity is mediated through a receptor-independent, nonstereoselective mechanism.

22424229|a|Amyloid fibers and oligomers are associated with a great variety of human diseases including Alzheimer's disease and the prion conditions. Here we attempt to connect recent discoveries on the molecular properties of proteins in the amyloid state with observations about pathological tissues and disease states. We summarize studies of structure and nucleation of amyloid and relate these to observations on amyloid polymorphism, prion strains, coaggregation of pathogenic proteins in tissues, and mechanisms of toxicity and transmissibility. Molecular studies have also led to numerous strategies for biological and chemical interventions against amyloid diseases.

22424230|a|There are still no effective treatments to prevent, halt, or reverse Alzheimer's disease, but research advances over the past three decades could change this gloomy picture. Genetic studies demonstrate that the disease has multiple causes. Interdisciplinary approaches combining biochemistry, molecular and cell biology, and transgenic modeling have revealed some of its molecular mechanisms. Progress in chemistry, radiology, and systems biology is beginning to provide useful biomarkers, and the emergence of personalized medicine is poised to transform pharmaceutical development and clinical trials. However, investigative and drug development efforts should be diversified to fully address the multifactoriality of the disease.

22424792|t|Characterisation of the effect of knockout of the amyloid precursor protein on outcome following mild traumatic brain injury.
22424792|a|The amyloid precursor protein (APP) increases following traumatic brain injury (TBI), although the functional significance of this remains unclear largely because the functions of the subsequent APP metabolites are so different: Abeta is neurotoxic whilst sAPPalpha is neuroprotective. To investigate this further, APP wildtype and knockout mice were subjected to mild diffuse TBI and their outcomes compared. APP knockout mice displayed significantly worse cognitive and motor deficits, as demonstrated by the Barnes Maze and rotarod respectively, than APP wildtype mice. This was associated with a significant increase in hippocampal and cortical cell loss, as well as axonal injury, in APP knockout mice and an impaired neuroreparative response as indicated by diminished GAP-43 immunoreactivity when compared to APP wildtype mice. This study is the first to demonstrate that endogenous APP is beneficial following mild TBI, suggesting that the upregulation of APP observed following injury is an acute protective response.

22426016|t|Assessing candidate serum biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease: a longitudinal study.
22426016|a|Because of the growing impact of late onset cognitive loss, considerable effort has been directed toward the development of improved diagnostic techniques for Alzheimer's disease (AD) that may pave the way for earlier (and more effective) therapeutic efforts. Serum-based biomarkers are the least expensive and invasive modality for screening and routine monitoring. We systematically reviewed the literature to assemble a list of serum biomarkers relevant to AD. In parallel, we conducted a proteomic LC-MS/MS analysis of serum collected from neurologically normal subjects and subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early AD (n = 6 in all). Complement C3 and alpha-2-macroglobulin were identified from both the literature review and our proteomic screen for further validation. For these two candidates, ELISA was performed on serum collected from a small independent cohort of subjects for longitudinal analysis. Serum was serially collected from neurologically normal subjects (n = 5) and subjects with MCI who were subsequently followed for a period of two years (n = 5) and regrouped into stable MCI and progressive MCI or AD (n = 6). The ability of each marker to predict which subjects with MCI would progress to dementia and which would remain cognitively stable was assessed. Patients with probable cerebral amyloid angiopathy were also identified (n = 3). This preliminary analysis tested the most-promising serum protein biomarkers for AD and we concluded that none are yet ready for use in the clinical diagnosis and management of dementia. However, a more thorough assessment in longitudinal studies with higher statistical power is warranted.

22426017|t|PSEN1 mutation carriers present lower cerebrospinal fluid amyoid-beta42 levels than sporadic early-onset Alzheimer's disease patients but no differences in neuronal injury biomarkers.
22426017|a|Most cases of early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) are sporadic. A minority of EOAD are caused by specific genetic defects in PSEN1, PSEN2, or AbetaPP genes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker comparisons between sporadic and monogenic EOAD are practically inexistent. CSF and MRI data from 14 amnestic-onset sporadic EOAD (sEOAD) subjects were compared with data from 8 symptomatic PSEN1 mutation carriers (PSEN1) and 14 age-matched cognitively-preserved controls. CSF concentrations of amyloid-beta (Abeta)(42), total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) were determined. Cortical thickness (CTh) and grey matter loss were compared between groups and correlated with CSF biomarkers. PSEN1 had significantly lower CSF Abeta(42) levels compared to sEOAD (mean 244.8 pg/ml versus 381.4 pg/ml; p = 0.006), but no differences in t-tau or p-tau. Both sEOAD and PSEN1 showed widespread CTh loss in AD target areas when compared with controls. No differences were found in the direct comparison between sEOAD and PSEN1 CTh after adjusting for age and Mini-Mental Status Examination scores. Neither was a correlation found between Abeta(42) levels and CTh. CTh in the left superior parietal and caudal middle frontal areas was negatively correlated with t-tau values. In conclusion, PSEN1 had lower Abeta(42) CSF levels compared with sEOAD, suggesting a greater cerebral deposition of Abeta(42). These differences in Abeta(42) deposition were not significantly reflected in the brain structure, and CTh was only correlated with total tau. The lack of significant differences in relation to t-tau and p-tau levels and to the severity of CTh or grey matter loss suggests a similar level of neuronal injury despite higher Abeta(42) load in PSEN1.

22426018|t|Variability in blood-based amyloid-beta assays: the need for consensus on pre-analytical processing.
22426018|a|Effective therapeutic interventions for Alzheimer's disease (AD) will require treatment regimes to move toward the earliest stages of the disease. For this to occur the field has to identify biomarkers that are able to accurately identify individuals at risk for progression toward AD in the presymptomatic stage. One very significant implication is that some form of population-based screening will need to be undertaken in order to identify those at risk. To date, efforts in neuroimaging brain amyloid-beta (Abeta) and changes in cerebrospinal fluid Abeta and tau levels shows promise, however, it is questionable as to whether these methods are applicable for screening the general population. The Abeta peptide is also found in blood which is the most economical and efficient biological fluid to analyze. Unfortunately, investigations into blood-based diagnostic markers have produced mixed results. This variability is likely to be the result of differences in the preanalytical processing of samples and as such is delaying progress in the field. Reported preanalytical processing techniques from 87 recent articles focusing on the measurement of Abeta in blood were compared, to investigate whether basic sample-handling techniques were comparable between studies. This comparison revealed that not only is it likely that some of the variability in blood-based results is attributable to discrepancies in preanalytical methodologies but also that the field is failing to adequately report sample processing techniques. This review highlights the current shortcomings in methodological reporting and recommends a standardized blood collection methodology based on the limited consensus of the reviewed articles.

22426239|t|Amyloid beta selectively modulates neuronal TrkB alternative transcript expression with implications for Alzheimer's disease.
22426239|a|Dysregulation in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/full-length TrkB (TrkB-TK+) signaling is implicated in promoting neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). BDNF/TrkB-TK+ signaling can be modulated by the presence of truncated TrkB isoforms (TrkB-TK-, TrkB-Shc). All TrkB isoforms are encoded by different alternative transcripts. In this study, we assessed if expression of the three main TrkB alternative transcripts, TrkB-TK+, TrkB-TK-, and TrkB-Shc are altered in AD. Using a cohort of control and AD brains (n=29), we surveyed the hippocampus, temporal cortex, occipital cortex, and cerebellum and found specific increases in TrkB-Shc, a neuron-specific transcript, in the AD hippocampus. No significant changes were detected in TrkB-TK+ and TrkB-TK- transcript levels in AD in any brain region examined. Corresponding changes in truncated TrkB protein levels were found in the hippocampus, although a significant increase in the temporal cortex was also observed. Our findings suggested that neuron-specific changes in TrkB may be occurring in AD; thus, we determined whether TrkB-Shc expression could be modulated by amyloid beta 1-42 (Abeta(42)). We found increased TrkB-Shc mRNA levels in differentiated SHSY5Y neuronal cell-lines exposed to fibril-containing Abeta(42) preparations. When we assessed the cellular impact of increased TrkB-Shc, we found co-localization between TrkB-Shc and TrkB-TK+. Interestingly, TrkB-Shc overexpression selectively attenuated BDNF/TrkB-TK+-mediated signaling via the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) pathway, but not the protein kinase B pathway. In AD, MEK signaling is increased in vulnerable neurons and linked to abnormal phosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins. Altogether, our findings suggest that elevated TrkB-Shc expression in AD may function as a compensatory response in neurons in AD to promote survival.

22426390|t|Brain, blood, and iron: perspectives on the roles of erythrocytes and iron in neurodegeneration.
22426390|a|The terms "neuroacanthocytosis" (NA) and "neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation" (NBIA) both refer to groups of genetically heterogeneous disorders, classified together due to similarities of their phenotypic or pathological findings. Even collectively, the disorders that comprise these sets are exceedingly rare and challenging to study. The NBIA disorders are defined by their appearance on brain magnetic resonance imaging, with iron deposition in the basal ganglia. Clinical features vary, but most include a movement disorder. New causative genes are being rapidly identified; however, the mechanisms by which mutations cause iron accumulation and neurodegeneration are not well understood. NA syndromes are also characterized by a progressive movement disorder, accompanied by cognitive and psychiatric features, resulting from mutations in a number of genes whose roles are also basically unknown. An overlapping feature of the two groups, NBIA and NA, is the occurrence of acanthocytes, spiky red cells with a poorly-understood membrane dysfunction. In this review we summarise recent developments in this field, specifically insights into cellular mechanisms and from animal models. Cell membrane research may shed light upon the significance of the erythrocyte abnormality, and upon possible connections between the two sets of disorders. Shared pathophysiologic mechanisms may lead to progress in the understanding of other types of neurodegeneration.

22426395|t|Effects of a tacrine-8-hydroxyquinoline hybrid (IQM-622) on Abeta accumulation and cell death: involvement in hippocampal neuronal loss in Alzheimer's disease.
22426395|a|Several studies have implicated the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) as well as several biometals in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A multifunctional molecule, the hybrid tacrine-8-hydroxyquinoline (named IQM-622), displays cholinergic, antioxidant, copper-complexing and neuroprotective properties. Using in vitro and in vivo models, we investigated the modulating effects of IQM-622 on amyloid beta-protein (Abeta)-induced pathology as well as on chemically induced neurodegeneration by domoic acid. In the first experimental model, we observed a significant decrease in brain Abeta deposits in IQM-622-treated APP/Ps1 mice for four weeks. Moreover, IQM-622 promoted the degradation of intracellular Abeta in astrocytes, and protected against Abeta toxicity in cultured astrocytes and neurons. These findings suggest that the neuroprotective effect of IQM-622 is not only related to AChE inhibition, but also involves other mechanisms, including the modulation of Abeta-degradation pathways in AD brain. In this study we also compare the neuronal loss in CA1 hippocampal field of AD patients and of mice treated with domoic acid, giving similar patterns. Thus, we used a second experimental model by killing hippocampal neurons by domoic acid damage, in which IQM-622 increased survival in the CA1 and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus. Our observations suggest that administration of IQM-622 may have significant beneficial effects in neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, which course with acute or progressive neuronal death.

22426424|t|Neuroprotection by the multitarget iron chelator M30 on age-related alterations in mice.
22426424|a|Based on a multimodal drug design paradigm, we have synthesized a multifunctional non-toxic, brain permeable iron chelating compound, M30, possessing the neuroprotective N-propargyl moiety of the anti-Parkinsonian drug, monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B inhibitor, rasagiline and the antioxidant-iron chelator moiety of an 8-hydroxyquinoline derivative of the iron chelator, VK28. Here, we report that a chronic systemic treatment of aged mice with M30 (1 and 5mg/kg; 4 times weekly for 6 months), had a significant positive impact on neuropsychiatry functions and cognitive age-related impairment. M30 significantly reduced cerebral iron accumulation as demonstrated by Perl's staining, accompanied by a marked decrease in cerebral beta-amyloid plaques. In addition, our results demonstrate that M30 caused a significant inhibition of both MAO-A and -B activities in the cerebellum of aged mice, compared with vehicle-treated aged control mice. In summary, the present study indicates that the novel MAO inhibitor/iron chelating drug, M30, acting against multiple brain targets could reverse age-associated memory impairment and provide a potential treatment against the progression of neurodegeneration in ageing.

22429885|t|beta-Amyloid 42/40 ratio and kalirin expression in Alzheimer disease with psychosis.
22429885|a|Psychosis in Alzheimer disease differentiates a subgroup with more rapid decline, is heritable, and aggregates within families, suggesting a distinct neurobiology. Evidence indicates that greater impairments of cerebral cortical synapses, particularly in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, may contribute to the pathogenesis of psychosis in Alzheimer disease (AD) phenotype. Soluble beta-amyloid induces loss of dendritic spine synapses through impairment of long-term potentiation. In contrast, the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) kalirin is an essential mediator of spine maintenance and growth in cerebral cortex. We therefore hypothesized that psychosis in AD would be associated with increased soluble beta-amyloid and reduced expression of kalirin in the cortex. We tested this hypothesis in postmortem cortical gray matter extracts from 52 AD subjects with and without psychosis. In subjects with psychosis, the beta-amyloid(1-42)/beta-amyloid(1-40) ratio was increased, due primarily to reduced soluble beta-amyloid(1-40), and kalirin-7, -9, and -12 were reduced. These findings suggest that increased cortical beta-amyloid(1-42)/beta-amyloid(1-40) ratio and decreased kalirin expression may both contribute to the pathogenesis of psychosis in AD.

22429964|t|Heparan sulfate subdomains that are degraded by Sulf accumulate in cerebral amyloid ss plaques of Alzheimer's disease: evidence from mouse models and patients.
22429964|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by extracellular cerebral accumulation of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta). Heparan sulfate (HS) is a glycosaminoglycan that is abundant in the extracellular space. The state of sulfation within the HS chain influences its ability to interact with a variety of proteins. Highly sulfated domains within HS are crucial for Abeta aggregation in vitro. Here, we investigated the expression of the sulfated domains and HS disaccharide composition in the brains of Tg2576, J20, and T41 transgenic AD mouse models, and patients with AD. RB4CD12, a phage display antibody, recognizes highly sulfated domains of HS. The RB4CD12 epitope is abundant in the basement membrane of brain vessels under physiological conditions. In the cortex and hippocampus of the mice and patients with AD, RB4CD12 strongly stained both diffuse and neuritic amyloid plaques. Interestingly, RB4CD12 also stained the intracellular granules of certain hippocampal neurons in AD brains. Disaccharide compositions in vessel-enriched and nonvasculature fractions of Tg2576 mice and AD patients were found to be comparable to those of non-transgenic and non-demented controls, respectively. The RB4CD12 epitope in amyloid plaques was substantially degraded ex vivo by Sulf-1 and Sulf-2, extracellular HS endosulfatases. These results indicate that formation of highly sulfated HS domains may be upregulated in conjunction with AD pathogenesis, and that these domains can be enzymatically remodeled in AD brains.

22430529|t|Intrahippocampal administration of amyloid-beta(1-42) oligomers acutely impairs spatial working memory, insulin signaling, and hippocampal metabolism.
22430529|a|Increasing evidence suggests that abnormal brain accumulation of amyloid-beta(1-42) (Abeta(1-42)) oligomers plays a causal role in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and in particular may cause the cognitive deficits that are the hallmark of AD. In vitro, Abeta(1-42) oligomers impair insulin signaling and suppress neural functioning. We previously showed that endogenous insulin signaling is an obligatory component of normal hippocampal function, and that disrupting this signaling led to a rapid impairment of spatial working memory, while delivery of exogenous insulin to the hippocampus enhanced both memory and metabolism; diet-induced insulin resistance both impaired spatial memory and prevented insulin from increasing metabolism or cognitive function. Hence, we tested the hypothesis that Abeta(1-42) oligomers could acutely impair hippocampal metabolic and cognitive processes in vivo in the rat. Our findings support this hypothesis: Abeta(1-42) oligomers impaired spontaneous alternation behavior while preventing the task-associated dip in hippocampal ECF glucose observed in control animals. In addition, Abeta(1-42) oligomers decreased plasma membrane translocation of the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter 4 (GluT4), and impaired insulin signaling as measured by phosphorylation of Akt. These data show in vivo that Abeta(1-42) oligomers can rapidly impair hippocampal cognitive and metabolic processes, and provide support for the hypothesis that elevated Abeta(1-42) leads to cognitive impairment via interference with hippocampal insulin signaling.

22430532|t|Abeta25-35 injection into the temporal cortex induces chronic inflammation that contributes to neurodegeneration and spatial memory impairment in rats.
22430532|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta)25-35 is able to cause memory impairment and neurodegenerative events. Recent evidence has shown that the injection of Abeta25-35 into the temporal cortex (TCx) of rats increases the inflammatory response; however, it is unclear how the inflammatory process could be involved in the progression of Abeta25-35 toxicity. In this study we investigated the role of inflammation in the neuronal damage and spatial memory impairment generated by Abeta25-35 in rat TCx using immunohistochemistry, ELISA, and a behavioral test in the radial maze. Our findings show that Abeta25-35 -injection into the TCx induced a reactive gliosis (GFAP and CD11b-reactivity) and an increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-17, and TNF-alpha) in the TCx and the hippocampus at 5, 15, and 30 days after injection. Thirty days after Abeta25-35 injection, we observed that the inflammatory reaction probably contributed to increase the immunoreactivity of inducible nitric oxide synthase and nitrite levels, as well as to the loss of neurons in TCx and hippocampus. Behavioral performance showed that the neurodegeneration evoked by Abeta25-35 delayed acquisition of learning and impaired spatial memory, because the Abeta25-35-treated animals showed a greater number of errors during the task than the control group. Previous administration of an interleukin receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) (10 and 20 mug/muL, into TCx), an anti-inflammatory agent, suppressed the Abeta25-35-induced inflammatory response and neurodegeneration, as well as memory dysfunction. This study suggests that the chronic inflammatory reaction could contribute to the progression of Abeta25-35 toxicity and cause cognitive impairment.

22430533|t|Alzheimer's disease-related loss of Pin1 function influences the intracellular localization and the processing of AbetaPP.
22430533|a|Increased amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) is a characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We previously observed that the prolyl isomerase Pin1, which is down-regulated in AD, regulates AbetaPP conformation accelerating cis/trans isomerization of the phospho-Thr668-Pro669 peptide bond, and that Pin1 knockout in mice increases the amyloidogenic processing of AbetaPP, although the underlying mechanism is still unknown. Since the intracellular localization of AbetaPP determines whether the processing will be amyloidogenic or non-amyloidogenic, here we addressed the question whether loss of Pin1 function affects the intracellular localization of AbetaPP, influencing AbetaPP processing. Using cellular models of Pin1 knockout and Pin1 knockdown, we have demonstrated that lowering Pin1 levels changed the intracellular localization and the processing of AbetaPP. Under these conditions, less AbetaPP was retained at the plasma membrane favoring the amyloidogenic processing, and the kinetics of AbetaPP internalization increased as well as the nuclear trafficking of AbetaPP C-terminal fragment AICD. In addition, AbetaPPThr668Ala mutant, which cannot bind to Pin1 and retains more trans conformation, rescued the levels of AbetaPP at the plasma membrane in Pin1 knockout cells. Thus, loss of Pin1 function contributes to amyloidogenic pathways, by facilitating both the removal of AbetaPP from compartments where it is mostly non-amyloidogenic and its internalization to more amyloidogenic compartments. These data suggest that physiological levels of Pin1 are important to control the intracellular localization and metabolic fate of Thr668-phosphorylated AbetaPP, and regulation of AbetaPP conformation is especially important in pathologic conditions of AbetaPP hyperphosphorylation and/or loss of Pin1 function, associated with AD.

22431227|t|beta-amyloid decreases detectable endothelial nitric oxide synthase in human erythrocytes: a role for membrane acetylcholinesterase.
22431227|a|Until few years ago, many studies of Alzheimer's disease investigated the effects of this syndrome in the central nervous system. Only recently, the detection of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) in the blood has evidenced the necessity to extend studies on extraneuronal cells, particularly on erythrocytes. Abeta is also present in brain capillaries, where it interacts with the erythrocytes, inducing several metabolic and functional alterations. Recently, functionally active endothelial type nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) was discovered in human erythrocytes. The goal of the present study was to evidence the effect of Abeta on erythrocyte eNOS. We found that Abeta following to 24-h exposure causes a decrease in the immune staining of erythrocyte eNOS. Concurrently, Abeta alters erythrocyte cell morphology, decreases nitrites and nitrates levels, and affects membrane acetylcholinesterase activity. Propidium, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, was able to reverse the effects elicited by Abeta. These events could contribute to the vascular alterations associated with Alzheimer's disease disease.

22431834|t|Age and rate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer disease: implications for clinical trials.
22431834|a|BACKGROUND: Factors that affect the rate of progression of Alzheimer disease (AD) need to be considered in the clinical trial designs of potential disease-modifying therapies. OBJECTIVE: To determine the influence of age on AD course in a clinical trial setting. DESIGN: Pooled cohort study from 3 AD clinical trials of 18-month duration conducted by the Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study group. SETTING: Alzheimer disease research centers from across the United States. PATIENTS: Four hundred seventy-one subjects with mild to moderate AD assigned to the placebo arm of 3 clinical trials. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The relationships between baseline age and rate of change in the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) 11, Mini-Mental State Examination, Clinical Dementia Rating scale Sum of Boxes score, Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study-activities of daily living scale, and Neuropsychiatric Inventory were analyzed using a mixed-effect regression model. Sample size calculation for possible future AD clinical trials lasting 18 months using the results of the change in ADAS-cog 11 by tertiles of age groups. RESULTS: Older age at baseline was associated with a slower rate of decline in the ADAS-cog 11 and the Mini-Mental State Examination scores. Almost twice as many subjects aged 80 years and older compared with those aged younger than 70 years would be required to demonstrate a 30% treatment effect on the ADAS-cog 11 in an 18-month AD trial. CONCLUSION: Subject age is an important factor to consider when defining the study population in and analyzing data from AD trials of potential disease-modifying therapies.

22433669|t|Brain pericytes ABCA1 expression mediates cholesterol efflux but not cellular amyloid-beta peptide accumulation.
22433669|a|In brain, excess cholesterol is metabolized into 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S-OH-chol) and eliminated into the circulation across the blood-brain barrier. 24S-OH-chol is a natural agonist of the nuclear liver X receptors (LXRs) involved in peripheral cholesterol homeostasis. The effects of this oxysterol on the pericytes embedded in the basal lamina of this barrier (close to the brain compartment) have not been previously studied. We used primary cultures of brain pericytes to demonstrate that the latter express LXR nuclear receptors and their target gene ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A, member 1 (ABCA1), known to be one of the major transporters involved in peripheral lipid homeostasis. Treatment with 24S-OH-chol caused an increase in ABCA1 expression that correlated with a reverse cholesterol transfer to apolipoprotein E, apolipoprotein A-I, and high density lipoprotein particles. Inhibition of ABCA1 decreased this efflux. As pericytes are able to internalize the amyloid-beta peptides which accumulate in brain of Alzheimer's disease patients, we then investigated the effects of 24S-OH-chol on this process. We found that the cellular accumulation process was not modified by 24S-OH-chol treatment. Overall, our results highlight the importance of the LXR/ABCA1 system in brain pericytes and suggest a new role for these cells in brain cholesterol homeostasis.

22433867|t|Identification of novel potentially toxic oligomers formed in vitro from mammalian-derived expanded huntingtin exon-1 protein.
22433867|a|Huntington disease is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder that arises from an expanded polyglutamine region in the N terminus of the HD gene product, huntingtin. Protein inclusions comprised of N-terminal fragments of mutant huntingtin are a characteristic feature of disease, though are likely to play a protective role rather than a causative one in neurodegeneration. Soluble oligomeric assemblies of huntingtin formed early in the aggregation process are candidate toxic species in HD. In the present study, we established an in vitro system to generate recombinant huntingtin in mammalian cells. Using both denaturing and native gel analysis, we have identified novel oligomeric forms of mammalian-derived expanded huntingtin exon-1 N-terminal fragment. These species are transient and were not previously detected using bacterially expressed exon-1 protein. Importantly, these species are recognized by 3B5H10, an antibody that recognizes a two-stranded hairpin conformation of expanded polyglutamine believed to be associated with a toxic form of huntingtin. Interestingly, comparable oligomeric species were not observed for expanded huntingtin shortstop, a 117-amino acid fragment of huntingtin shown previously in mammalian cell lines and transgenic mice, and here in primary cortical neurons, to be non-toxic. Further, we demonstrate that expanded huntingtin shortstop has a reduced ability to form amyloid-like fibrils characteristic of the aggregation pathway for toxic expanded polyglutamine proteins. Taken together, these data provide a possible candidate toxic species in HD. In addition, these studies demonstrate the fundamental differences in early aggregation events between mutant huntingtin exon-1 and shortstop proteins that may underlie the differences in toxicity.

22434822|t|Calsyntenin-1 mediates axonal transport of the amyloid precursor protein and regulates Abeta production.
22434822|a|Understanding the mechanisms that control processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to produce amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide represents a key area of Alzheimer's disease research. Here, we show that siRNA-mediated loss of calsyntenin-1 in cultured neurons alters APP processing to increase production of Abeta. We also show that calsyntenin-1 is reduced in Alzheimer's disease brains and that the extent of this reduction correlates with increased Abeta levels. Calsyntenin-1 is a ligand for kinesin-1 light chains and APP is transported through axons on kinesin-1 molecular motors. Defects in axonal transport are an early pathological feature in Alzheimer's disease and defective APP transport is known to increase Abeta production. We show that calsyntenin-1 and APP are co-transported through axons and that siRNA-induced loss of calsyntenin-1 markedly disrupts axonal transport of APP. Thus, perturbation to axonal transport of APP on calsyntenin-1 containing carriers induces alterations to APP processing that increase production of Abeta. Together, our findings suggest that disruption of calsyntenin-1-associated axonal transport of APP is a pathogenic mechanism in Alzheimer's disease.

22436237|t|Nitric oxide stress in sporadic inclusion body myositis muscle fibres: inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase prevents interleukin-1beta-induced accumulation of beta-amyloid and cell death.
22436237|a|Sporadic inclusion body myositis is a severely disabling myopathy. The design of effective treatment strategies is hampered by insufficient understanding of the complex disease pathology. Particularly, the nature of interrelationships between inflammatory and degenerative pathomechanisms in sporadic inclusion body myositis has remained elusive. In Alzheimer's dementia, accumulation of beta-amyloid has been shown to be associated with upregulation of nitric oxide. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, an overexpression of inducible nitric oxide synthase was observed in five out of ten patients with sporadic inclusion body myositis, two of eleven with dermatomyositis, three of eight with polymyositis, two of nine with muscular dystrophy and two of ten non-myopathic controls. Immunohistochemistry confirmed protein expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and demonstrated intracellular nitration of tyrosine, an indicator for intra-fibre production of nitric oxide, in sporadic inclusion body myositis muscle samples, but much less in dermatomyositis or polymyositis, hardly in dystrophic muscle and not in non-myopathic controls. Using fluorescent double-labelling immunohistochemistry, a significant co-localization was observed in sporadic inclusion body myositis muscle between beta-amyloid, thioflavine-S and nitrotyrosine. In primary cultures of human myotubes and in myoblasts, exposure to interleukin-1beta in combination with interferon-gamma induced a robust upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase messenger RNA. Using fluorescent detectors of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide, dichlorofluorescein and diaminofluorescein, respectively, flow cytometry revealed that interleukin-1beta combined with interferon-gamma induced intracellular production of nitric oxide, which was associated with necrotic cell death in muscle cells. Intracellular nitration of tyrosine was noted, which partly co-localized with amyloid precursor protein, but not with desmin. Pharmacological inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase by 1400W reduced intracellular production of nitric oxide and prevented accumulation of beta-amyloid, nitration of tyrosine as well as cell death inflicted by interleukin-1beta combined with interferon-gamma. Collectively, these data suggest that, in skeletal muscle, inducible nitric oxide synthase is a central component of interactions between interleukin-1beta and beta-amyloid, two of the most relevant molecules in sporadic inclusion body myositis. The data further our understanding of the pathology of sporadic inclusion body myositis and may point to novel treatment strategies.

22437427|t|Exploring the reactivity of flavonoid compounds with metal-associated amyloid-beta species.
22437427|a|Metal ions associated with amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides have been suggested to be involved in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but this remains unclear and controversial. Some attempts to rationally design or select small molecules with structural moieties for metal chelation and Abeta interaction (i.e., bifunctionality) have been made to gain a better understanding of the hypothesis. In order to contribute to these efforts, four synthetic flavonoid derivatives FL1-FL4 were rationally selected according to the principles of bifunctionality and their abilities to chelate metal ions, interact with Abeta, inhibit metal-induced Abeta aggregation, scavenge radicals, and regulate the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were studied using physical methods and biological assays. The compounds FL1-FL3 were able to chelate metal ions, but showed limited solubility in aqueous buffered solutions. In the case of FL4, which was most compatible with aqueous conditions, its binding affinities for Cu(2+) and Zn(2+) (nM and muM, respectively) were obtained through solution speciation studies. The direct interaction between FL4 and Abeta monomer was weak, which was monitored by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Employing FL1-FL4, no noticeable inhibitory effect on metal-mediated Abeta aggregation was observed. Among FL1-FL4, FL3, having 3-OH, 4-oxo, and 4'-N(CH(3))(2) groups, exhibited similar antioxidant activity to the vitamin E analogue, Trolox, and ca. 60% reduction in the amount of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) generated by Cu(2+)-Abeta in the presence of dioxygen (O(2)) and a reducing agent. Overall, the studies here suggest that although four flavonoid molecules were selected based on expected bifunctionality, their properties and metal-Abeta reactivity were varied depending on the structure differences, demonstrating that bifunctionality must be well tuned to afford desirable reactivity.

22437434|t|In vivo electroporation of a new gene vaccine encoding ten repeats of Abeta3-10 prevents brain Abeta deposition and delays cognitive impairment in young Tg-APPswe/PSEN1dE9 mice.
22437434|a|Active immunization holds great promise for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease but the infiltration of T-lymphocytes and associated meningoencephalitis observed in clinical trials needs to be overcome. To avoid this toxicity, previous studies have used synthetic truncated derivatives of Abeta to promote humoral immunity. In this study, we developed a novel vaccine [p(Abeta3-10)10-MT] that expresses ten repeats of Abeta3-10 with melatonin (MT) as an adjuvant, and administered it intramuscularly in three-month-old Tg-APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (Tg) mice by in vivo electroporation. The p(Abeta3-10)10-MT vaccine induced high titers of anti-Abeta antibodies, which in turn reduced Abeta deposits in the mouse brains and decreased cognitive impairment. Immunoglobulin isotyping revealed a predominantly IgG1 response, indicating a Th2 anti-inflammatory response. Ex vivo cultured splenocytes exhibited a low IFN-gamma and high IL-4 response. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that glial cell activation was also attenuated. These results indicate that p(Abeta3-10)10-MT may potentially be an effective vaccine to reduce accumulated Abeta and attenuate cognitive deficits.

22437436|t|Levels of amyloid beta-42, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.
22437436|a|Amyloid beta42 (Abeta42) and proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) have been suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD). Our aim was to examine whether the changes in these parameters would be able to discriminate the patients with AD from those with VaD and from healthy individuals. We have analyzed the levels of Abeta42, IL-6 and TNF-alpha in the serum of newly diagnosed 28 AD patients, 16 VaD patients and 26 healthy non-demented controls. We also investigated whether there is an association between Abeta42, IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores and body mass indexes (BMI) of patients. Our data showed a significant decrease in serum Abeta-42 levels in AD patients compared to VaD patients and controls. Levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha were not different between AD patients, VaD patients and controls. We observed a correlation between Abeta-42 levels and MMSE scores and BMI levels in both AD and VaD patients. However, Abeta-42 levels were not correlated with IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels. Significantly lower levels of Abeta42 found in the serum of AD patients than that of VaD patients and controls suggests that it can be a specific biochemical marker for AD.

22438044|t|Complement component C3 and complement receptor type 3 contribute to the phagocytosis and clearance of fibrillar Abeta by microglia.
22438044|a|Complement components and their receptors are found within and around amyloid beta (Abeta) cerebral plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Microglia defend against pathogens through phagocytosis via complement component C3 and/or engagement of C3 cleavage product iC3b with complement receptor type 3 (CR3, Mac-1). Here, we provide direct evidence that C3 and Mac-1 mediate, in part, phagocytosis and clearance of fibrillar amyloid-beta (fAbeta) by murine microglia in vitro and in vivo. Microglia took up not only synthetic fAbeta(42)  but also amyloid cores from patients with AD, transporting them to lysosomes in vitro. Fibrillar Abeta(42)  uptake was significantly attenuated by the deficiency or knockdown of C3 or Mac-1 and scavenger receptor class A ligands. In addition, C3 or Mac-1 knockdown combined with a scavenger receptor ligand, fucoidan, further attenuated fibrillar Abeta(42)  uptake by N9 microglia. Fluorescent fibrillar Abeta(42)  microinjected cortically was significantly higher in C3 and Mac-1 knockout mice compared with wild-type mice 5 days after surgery, indicating reduced clearance in vivo. Together, these results demonstrate that C3 and Mac-1 are involved in phagocytosis and clearance of fAbeta by microglia, providing support for a potential beneficial role for microglia and the complement system in AD pathogenesis.   2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

22440675|t|The levels of water-soluble and triton-soluble Abeta are increased in Alzheimer's disease brain.
22440675|a|Although plaques composed of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) are considered a defining feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), they are also found in cognitively normal individuals and extensive evidence suggests that non-plaque, water-soluble forms of Abeta may play a role in AD pathogenesis. However, the relationship between the levels of water-soluble Abeta and the clinical severity of disease has never been investigated. Here, we present results of a pilot study designed to examine the levels of water-soluble forms of Abeta in brains of individuals who died at clinically distinct stages of AD. Using a serial extraction method, we also investigated the levels of triton-soluble and formic acid-soluble Abeta. We found that water-soluble and detergent-soluble Abeta monomer and SDS-stable dimer were elevated in AD and that the levels of water soluble Abeta did not increase with plaque pathology. These results support the notion that both water- and detergent-soluble Abeta are important in AD and are not simply released from plaques by mechanical disruption. Moreover, the fact that the levels of water- and triton-soluble Abeta were similar in very mild/mild AD and moderate/severe AD suggests that once a certain level of these species is attained, further accumulation is not necessary for the disease to progress. Consequently, therapeutic targeting of water-soluble Abeta should best benefit individuals in earliest phases of the disease process.

22445334|a|In this issue of Neuron, Raj et al. (2012) and Zhou et al. (2012) use graph theory to suggest that neurodegenerative diseases spread diffusively via intrinsic brain networks. These studies provide a powerful model for understanding and predicting disease-specific profiles of neurodegeneration.

22445347|t|A network diffusion model of disease progression in dementia.
22445347|a|Patterns of dementia are known to fall into dissociated but dispersed brain networks, suggesting that the disease is transmitted along neuronal pathways rather than by proximity. This view is supported by neuropathological evidence for "prion-like" transsynaptic transmission of disease agents like misfolded tau and beta amyloid. We mathematically model this transmission by a diffusive mechanism mediated by the brain's connectivity network obtained from tractography of 14 healthy-brain MRIs. Subsequent graph theoretic analysis provides a fully quantitative, testable, predictive model of dementia. Specifically, we predict spatially distinct "persistent modes," which, we found, recapitulate known patterns of dementia and match recent reports of selectively vulnerable dissociated brain networks. Model predictions also closely match T1-weighted MRI volumetrics of 18 Alzheimer's and 18 frontotemporal dementia subjects. Prevalence rates predicted by the model strongly agree with published data. This work has many important implications, including dimensionality reduction, differential diagnosis, and especially prediction of future atrophy using baseline MRI morphometrics.

22445348|t|Predicting regional neurodegeneration from the healthy brain functional connectome.
22445348|a|Neurodegenerative diseases target large-scale neural networks. Four competing mechanistic hypotheses have been proposed to explain network-based disease patterning: nodal stress, transneuronal spread, trophic failure, and shared vulnerability. Here, we used task-free fMRI to derive the healthy intrinsic connectivity patterns seeded by brain regions vulnerable to any of five distinct neurodegenerative diseases. These data enabled us to investigate how intrinsic connectivity in health predicts region-by-region vulnerability to disease. For each illness, specific regions emerged as critical network "epicenters" whose normal connectivity profiles most resembled the disease-associated atrophy pattern. Graph theoretical analyses in healthy subjects revealed that regions with higher total connectional flow and, more consistently, shorter functional paths to the epicenters, showed greater disease-related vulnerability. These findings best fit a transneuronal spread model of network-based vulnerability. Molecular pathological approaches may help clarify what makes each epicenter vulnerable to its targeting disease and how toxic protein species travel between networked brain structures.

22445885|t|Evaluation of the effects of treatment with sAPPalpha on functional and histological outcome following controlled cortical impact injury in mice.
22445885|a|Treatment with sAPPalpha, the product of non-amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been shown to be protective following diffuse traumatic brain injury (TBI), by improving motor outcome and reducing axonal injury. However the effects of treatment with sAPPalpha following a focal TBI have yet to be determined. To investigate this, mice were subjected to a controlled cortical impact injury and treated with either sAPPalpha or its vehicle at 30 min post-injury. Following treatment with sAPPalpha the mice showed a significant improvement in motor and cognitive function early following injury, as determined on the ledged beam and Barnes Maze, respectively, relating to a more rapid rate of recovery. However the effect of treatment with sAPPalpha was not as dramatic as that seen previously following a diffuse injury. Nonetheless, these improvements in functional outcome were acompanied by a small but significant improvement in the amount of cortical and hippocampal at 7 days post-injury, and provide further support for the efficacy of sAPPalpha as a potential neuroprotective agent following TBI.

22445961|t|Rutin inhibits beta-amyloid aggregation and cytotoxicity, attenuates oxidative stress, and decreases the production of nitric oxide and proinflammatory cytokines.
22445961|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex, multi-factorial neurodegenerative disease. The aggregation of soluble beta-amyloid (Abeta) into fibrillar deposits is a pathological hallmark of AD. The Abeta aggregate-induced neurotoxicity, inflammatory reactions, oxidative stress, and nitric oxide (NO) generation are strongly linked to the etiology of AD. Here, we show that the common dietary flavonoid, rutin, can dose-dependently inhibit Abeta42 fibrillization and attenuate Abeta42-induced cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Moreover, rutin decreases the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), NO, glutathione disulfide (GSSG), and malondialdehyde (MDA), reduces inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity, attenuates mitochondrial damage, increases the glutathione (GSH)/GSSG ratio, enhances the activities of super oxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and modulates the production of proinflammatory cytokines by decreasing TNF-alpha and IL-1beta generation in microglia. Taken together, the actions of rutin on multiple pathogenic factors deserves further investigation for the prevention and treatment of AD.

22446499|a|The separation and detection of individual amyloid beta (Abeta) aggregates by capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence detection (CE-LIF) was demonstrated. Samples were prepared with either Abeta (1-40) or Abeta (1-42) peptides and were characterized by CE with ultraviolet (UV) absorbance detection and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Using thioflavin T (ThT) in the electrophoresis buffer, electrophoresis of aggregate-containing samples (5.0-s injection) produced up to several hundred narrow (< 20 ms FWHM [full width at half maximum]) fluorescence peaks. Injection of Abeta (1-40) monomer samples resulted in no additional peaks compared with controls. The CE-LIF results were validated by bulk ThT fluorescence measurements for the same samples. The potential of laser-induced fluorescence anisotropy (LIFA) with CE to characterize individual Abeta aggregates also was investigated.

22448932|t|Dimerization of the full-length Alzheimer amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta42) in explicit aqueous solution: a molecular dynamics study.
22448932|a|In this study, the mechanism of dimerization of the full-length Alzheimer amyloid beta (Abeta42) peptide and structural properties of the three most stable dimers have been elucidated through 0.8 mus classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The Abeta42 dimer has been reported to be the smallest neurotoxic species that adversely affects both memory and synaptic plasticity. On the basis of interactions between the distinct regions of the Abeta42 monomer, 10 different starting configurations were developed from their native folded structures. However, only six of them were found to form dimers and among them the three most stable (X(P), C-C(AP), and N-N(P)) were chosen for the detailed analysis. The structural properties of these dimers were compared with the available experimental and theoretical data. The MD simulations show that hydrophobic regions of both monomers play critical roles in the dimerization process. The high content of the alpha-helical structure in all the dimers is in line with its experimentally proposed role in the oligomerization. The formation of a zipper-like structure in X(P) is also in accordance with its existence in the aggregates of several short amyloidogenic peptides. The computed values of translational (D(T)) and rotational (D(R)) diffusion constants of 0.63 x 10(-6) cm(2)/s and 0.035 ns(-1), respectively, for this dimer are supported by the corresponding values of the Abeta42 monomer. These simulations have also elucidated several other key structural properties of these peptides. This information will be very useful to design small molecules for the inhibition and disruption of the critical Abeta42 dimers.

22449117|t|Study of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta12-28-Cys) interactions with Congo red and beta-sheet breaker peptides using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.
22449117|a|A surface-based approach is presented to study the interactions of Abeta12-28-Cys assembled on gold surfaces with Congo red (CR) and a beta-sheet breaker (BSB) peptide. The various aspects of the peptide film have been examined using different electrochemical and surface analytical techniques. Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results using redox probes [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-) show that Abeta12-28-Cys on gold forms a stable and reproducible blocking film. EIS analysis shows that CR and BSB have different effects on the electrochemical properties of Abeta12-28-Cys films, presumably due to changes in the interactions between the film and CR and BSB. EIS results indicate that in the case of CR film resistance decreases significantly presumably due to better penetration of the solution-based redox probe into the film, whereas in the case of BSB, the film resistance increases. We interpret this difference to BSB being able to interact with the Abeta12-28-Cys on the surface and presumably forming a film that presents a higher resistance for electron transfer from the redox probe to the solution.

22449754|t|Naphthoquinone-tyrptophan reduces neurotoxic Abeta*56 levels and improves cognition in Alzheimer's disease animal model.
22449754|a|An increasing body of evidence indicates a role for oligomers of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) in the neurotoxicity of this peptide and the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Several neurotoxic oligomeric forms of Abeta have been noted ranging from the larger Amyloid beta-Derived Diffusible Ligands (ADDLs) to smaller trimers and dimers of Abeta. More recently a dodecameric form of Abeta with a 56 kDa molecular weight, denoted Abeta*56, was shown to cause memory impairment in AD model mice. Here, we present for the first time a potential therapeutic strategy for AD that targets the early stages in the formation of neurotoxic Abeta*56 oligomers using a modified quinone-Tryptophan small molecule N-(3-chloro-1,4-dihydro-1,4-dioxo-2-naphthalenyl)-L-Tryptophan (Cl-NQTrp). Using NMR spectroscopy we show that this compound binds the aromatic recognition core of Abeta and prevents the formation of oligomers. We assessed the effect of Cl-NQTrp in vivo in transgenic flies expressing Abeta(1-42) in their nervous system. When these flies were fed with Cl-NQTrp a marked alleviation of their Abeta-engendered reduced life span and defective locomotion was observed. Finally, intraperitoneal injection of Cl-NQTrp into an aggressive AD mouse model reduced the level of the Abeta*56 species in their brain and reversed their cognitive defects. Further experiments should assess whether this is a direct effect of the drug in the brain or an indirect peripheral effect. This is the first demonstration that targeted reduction of Abeta*56 results in amelioration of AD symptoms. This second generation of tryptophan-modified naphthoquinones could therefore serve as potent disease modifying therapeutic for AD.

22450047|t|NMDA receptor/amyloid precursor protein interactions: a comparison between wild-type and amyloid precursor protein mutations associated with familial Alzheimer's disease.
22450047|a|Two recent reports showed that amyloid precursor protein (APP) may contribute to postsynaptic mechanisms via the regulation of the surface trafficking of excitatory N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Here we have investigated the interactions and surface trafficking of NR1-1a/NR2A and NR1-1a/NR2B NMDA receptor subtypes with three APP mutations linked to familial Alzheimer's disease, APP695(Indiana), APP695(London) and APP695(Swedish). Flag-tagged mutated APP695s were generated and shown to be expressed at equivalent levels to wild-type APP695 in mammalian cells. Each APP mutant co-precipitated with NR1-1a/NR2A and NR1-1a/NR2B receptors following co-expression in mammalian cells. Further, as found for wild-type APP695, each enhanced NMDA receptor surface expression with no concomitant increase in total NR1-1a, NR2A or NR2B subunit expression. Thus these three familial APP mutations behave as wild-type APP695 with respect to their association with assembled NMDA receptors and their APP695-enhanced receptor cell surface trafficking.

22450705|t|Structural features and cytotoxicity of amyloid oligomers: implications in Alzheimer's disease and other diseases with amyloid deposits.
22450705|a|Amyloid diseases display the presence, in targeted tissues and organs, of fibrillar deposits of specific peptides or proteins. Increasing efforts are presently spent in investigating the structural features and the structure-toxicity relation of the soluble oligomeric precursors arising in the path of fibrillization as well as the importance of surfaces as triggers of protein misfolding and aggregation and as possible responsible for amyloid polymorphism. Presently, it is recognized that the unstable, heterogeneous pre-fibrillar aggregates are the main responsible for amyloid toxicity. Conversely, mature fibrils are considered stable, harmless reservoirs of toxic species, although direct fibril toxicity has been reported. Recent studies show that mature fibrils grown at various conditions can display different structural features, stabilities and tendency to disassemble with leak of toxic oligomers. Fibril polymorphism can result from protein aggregation at differing conditions populating misfolded monomers and oligomers with distinct conformational characteristics. Recent research has started to unravel oligomer structural and biophysical features and their relation to cytotoxicity. Increasing information supports the notion that oligomer-membrane interaction, disruption of membrane integrity and cell impairment results from both oligomer and membrane biophysical features; accordingly, the formation of the oligomer-membrane complex, often the first step of amyloid toxicity, can be the result of the interplay of these events. This view can help explaining the variable vulnerability of different cell types to the same amyloids and the lack of relation between amyloid load and severity of clinical symptoms; it also stresses the importance, for cell/tissue impairment, of the presence of fibrils conformers of reduced stability as a possible source of oligomers resulting from leakage possibly favored by the interaction with suitable macromolecular/lipid surfaces or by other environmental conditions.

22451159|t|Plasma amyloid-beta as a predictor of dementia and cognitive decline: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
22451159|a|BACKGROUND: Preclinical prediction of Alzheimer disease (AD) is important and critical to effective intervention. Plasma levels of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides have been a principal focus of the growing literature on blood-based biomarkers, but studies to date have varied in design, assay methods, and sample size, making it difficult to readily interpret the overall data. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of relevant prospective studies to determine whether plasma amyloid-beta levels may predict development of dementia, AD, and cognitive decline. DESIGN: We searched prospective studies published between 1995 and 2011 indexed in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases. Selected studies included those measuring at least 1 relevant plasma amyloid-beta species (Abeta(40), Abeta(42), or Abeta(42):Abeta(40) ratio) and reporting an effect estimate for dementia, AD, or cognitive change. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Using a standardized extraction form, appropriate study parameters on subject information, exposure, and outcome were extracted. Random effects models were used to generate summary risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals comparing the bottom vs top quantiles for each plasma measure. RESULTS: Thirteen studies with a total of 10 303 subjects met inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. Lower Abeta(42):Abeta(40) ratios were significantly associated with development of AD (summary risk ratio, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.04-2.46; P = .03) and dementia (risk ratio, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.02-2.75; P = .04). Significant heterogeneity was found for both summary estimates, which could not be explained by participants' age, sex distribution, the study's follow-up time, or year of publication. Plasma levels of Abeta(40) and Abeta(42) alone were not significantly associated with either outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the literature indicates that plasma Abeta(42):Abeta(40) ratios predict development of AD and dementia. However, significant heterogeneity in the meta-analysis underlines the need for substantial further investigation of plasma amyloid-beta levels as a preclinical biomarker.

22451307|t|Pyruvate prevents the inhibition of the long-term potentiation induced by amyloid-beta through protein phosphatase 2A inactivation.
22451307|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers are derived from proteolytic cleavage of amyloid-beta protein precursor and can impair memory and hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in vivo and in vitro. They are recognized as the primary neurotoxic agents in Alzheimer's disease. Pyruvate has a protective effect against Abeta-induced neuronal cell death in hippocampal slice cultures. However, whether pyruvate also has a protective effect against the inhibition of neuronal plasticity induced by Abeta remains to be elucidated. This study examined the effect of pyruvate on the Abeta-induced inhibition of LTP in the rat hippocampus. We found that pyruvate prevented the Abeta-induced inhibition of LTP as strong as fostriecin, a specific protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor. Pyruvate prevented the Abeta block of Ca(2+)/calmodulin dependent protein kinase 2 (CaMK2) autophosphorylation and the Abeta-induced PP2A activation. Pyruvate, but not lactate, decreased reactive oxygen species levels in CA1 slices exposed to Abeta. We propose that pyruvate could prevent the Abeta-induced inhibition of LTP by the re-autophosphorylation of CaMK2 through PP2A inactivation. The reduction of reactive oxygen species production is considered to be the upstream mechanism of this observed pyruvate protection.

22451308|t|Overexpression of human wild-type amyloid-beta protein precursor decreases the iron content and increases the oxidative stress of neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells.
22451308|a|The accumulation of amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) is related to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the underlying mechanism is still unclear. The abnormal interactions of AbetaPP with metal ions such as iron are implicated in the process of oxidative stress in AD brains. In this study, we found that the overexpression of wild-type human AbetaPP695 decreased the iron content and increased the oxidative stress in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. The catalase activity of stably transfected cells overexpressing wild-type AbetaPP695 (AbetaPP cells) was significantly lower than that of the control cells. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and calcium levels significantly increased in AbetaPP cells compared to control cells. The mitochondrial membrane potential of AbetaPP cells was significantly lower than that of the control cells. Moreover, iron treatment decreased ROS and calcium levels and increased cell viability of AbetaPP cells. The iron deficiency in AbetaPP cells may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD.

22451313|t|AbetaPP intracellular C-terminal domain function is related to its degradation processes.
22451313|a|The amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) can be processed by either the amyloidogenic or the non-amyloidogenic pathway; both pathways lead to release of the AbetaPP intracellular C-terminal domain (AICD). AICD involvement in signal transduction within Fe65/Tip60 complex is one of the most discussed mechanisms, and different models have been hypothesized to explain the role of AICD within this complex. The analysis of these models in relation to the degradation processes highlights the discrepancy among AICD localization, function, and degradation, leading to the hypothesis that a signaling mechanism may exist which allows AbetaPP proteolysis to generate either a transcriptionally active fragment or an inactive one with different involvement of proteasome and IDE (insulin-degrading enzyme). Our work aimed to analyze the functional role of AICD within the Fe65/Tip60 complex considering the AICD degradation processes. Our data suggest a correlation between the role of AICD in gene regulation and its removal operated by proteasome activity. Moreover, treatments with IDE inhibitor underlined the presence of an alternative mechanism involved in AICD removal when the latter is not exerting nuclear activity, thus providing clearer support for the existence of at least two mechanisms as previously suggested.

22451318|t|CB1 agonist ACEA protects neurons and reduces the cognitive impairment of AbetaPP/PS1 mice.
22451318|a|The present study shows that chronic administration of the cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) receptor agonist arachidonyl-2-chloroethylamide (ACEA) at pre-symptomatic or at early symptomatic stages, at a non-amnesic dose, reduces the cognitive impairment observed in double AbetaPP(swe)/PS1(1dE9) transgenic mice from 6 months of age onwards. ACEA has no effect on amyloid-beta (Abeta) production, aggregation, or clearance. However, ACEA reduces the cytotoxic effect of Abeta42 oligomers in primary cultures of cortical neurons, and reverses Abeta-induced dephosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) in vitro and in vivo. Reduced activity of GSK3beta in ACEA-treated mice is further supported by the reduced amount of phospho-tau (Thr181) in neuritic processes around Abeta plaques. In addition, ACEA-treated mice show decreased astroglial response in the vicinity of Abeta plaques and decreased expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon-gamma in astrocytes when compared with age-matched vehicle-treated transgenic mice. Our present results show a beneficial effect of ACEA at both the neuronal, mediated at least in part by GSK3beta inhibition, and glial levels, resulting in a reduction of reactive astrocytes and lower expression of interferon-gamma. As a consequence, targeting the CB1 receptor could offer a versatile approach for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

22452395|t|Bifunctional compounds for controlling metal-mediated aggregation of the abeta42 peptide.
22452395|a|Abnormal interactions of Cu and Zn ions with the amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide are proposed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Disruption of these metal-peptide interactions using chemical agents holds considerable promise as a therapeutic strategy to combat this incurable disease. Reported herein are two bifunctional compounds (BFCs) L1 and L2 that contain both amyloid-binding and metal-chelating molecular motifs. Both L1 and L2 exhibit high stability constants for Cu(2+) and Zn(2+) and thus are good chelators for these metal ions. In addition, L1 and L2 show strong affinity toward Abeta species. Both compounds are efficient inhibitors of the metal-mediated aggregation of the Abeta(42) peptide and promote disaggregation of amyloid fibrils, as observed by ThT fluorescence, native gel electrophoresis/Western blotting, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Interestingly, the formation of soluble Abeta(42) oligomers in the presence of metal ions and BFCs leads to an increased cellular toxicity. These results suggest that for the Abeta(42) peptide-in contrast to the Abeta(40) peptide-the previously employed strategy of inhibiting Abeta aggregation and promoting amyloid fibril dissagregation may not be optimal for the development of potential AD therapeutics, due to formation of neurotoxic soluble Abeta(42) oligomers.

22452513|t|Self-assembly of flexible beta-strands into immobile amyloid-like beta-sheets in membranes as revealed by solid-state 19F NMR.
22452513|a|The cationic peptide [KIGAKI](3) was designed as an amphiphilic beta-strand and serves as a model for beta-sheet aggregation in membranes. Here, we have characterized its molecular conformation, membrane alignment, and dynamic behavior using solid-state (19)F NMR. A detailed structure analysis of selectively (19)F-labeled peptides was carried out in oriented DMPC bilayers. It showed a concentration-dependent transition from monomeric beta-strands to oligomeric beta-sheets. In both states, the rigid (19)F-labeled side chains project straight into the lipid bilayer but they experience very different mobilities. At low peptide-to-lipid ratios <=1:400, monomeric [KIGAKI](3) swims around freely on the membrane surface and undergoes considerable motional averaging, with essentially uncoupled phi/psi torsion angles. The flexibility of the peptide backbone in this 2D plane is reminiscent of intrinsically unstructured proteins in 3D. At high concentrations, [KIGAKI](3) self-assembles into immobilized beta-sheets, which are untwisted and lie flat on the membrane surface as amyloid-like fibrils. This is the first time the transition of monomeric beta-strands into oligomeric beta-sheets has been characterized by solid-state NMR in lipid bilayers. It promises to be a valuable approach for studying membrane-induced amyloid formation of many other, clinically relevant peptide systems.

22457485|t|Bidirectional relationship between functional connectivity and amyloid-beta deposition in mouse brain.
22457485|a|Brain region-specific deposition of extracellular amyloid plaques principally composed of aggregated amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide is a pathological signature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent human neuroimaging data suggest that resting-state functional connectivity strength is reduced in patients with AD, cognitively normal elderly harboring elevated amyloid burden, and in advanced aging. Interestingly, there exists a striking spatial correlation between functional connectivity strength in cognitively normal adults and the location of Abeta plaque deposition in AD. However, technical limitations have heretofore precluded examination of the relationship between functional connectivity, Abeta deposition, and normal aging in mouse models. Using a novel functional connectivity optical intrinsic signal (fcOIS) imaging technique, we demonstrate that Abeta deposition is associated with significantly reduced bilateral functional connectivity in multiple brain regions of older APP/PS1 transgenic mice. The amount of Abeta deposition in each brain region was associated with the degree of local, age-related bilateral functional connectivity decline. Normal aging was associated with reduced bilateral functional connectivity specifically in retrosplenial cortex. Furthermore, we found that the magnitude of regional bilateral functional correlation in young APP/PS1 mice before Abeta plaque formation was proportional to the amount of region-specific plaque deposition seen later in older APP/PS1 mice. Together, these findings suggest that Abeta deposition and normal aging are associated with region-specific disruption of functional connectivity and that the magnitude of local bilateral functional connectivity predicts regional vulnerability to subsequent Abeta deposition in mouse brain.

22459153|t|The Psen1-L166P-knock-in mutation leads to amyloid deposition in human wild-type amyloid precursor protein YAC transgenic mice.
22459153|a|Genetically engineered mice have been generated to model cerebral beta-amyloidosis, one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology, based on the overexpression of a mutated cDNA of the amyloid-beta precursor protein (AbetaPP) or by knock-in of the murine Abetapp gene alone or with presenilin1 mutations. Here we describe the generation and initial characterization of a new mouse line based on the presence of 2 copies of the human genomic region encoding the wild-type AbetaPP and the L166P presenilin 1 mutation. At ~6 mo of age, double-mutant mice develop amyloid pathology, with signs of neuritic dystrophy, intracellular Abeta accumulation, and glial inflammation, an increase in AbetaPP C-terminal fragments, and an 8 times increase in Abeta42 levels with a 40% decrease in Abeta40 levels, leading to a significant increase (14 times) of Abeta42/Abeta40 ratios, with minimal effects on presenilin or the Notch1 pathway in the brain. We conclude that in mice, neither mutations in AbetaPP nor overexpression of an AbetaPP isoform are a prerequisite for Abeta pathology. This model will allow the study of AD pathogenesis and testing of therapeutic strategies in a more relevant environment without experimental artifacts due to the overexpression of a single-mutant AbetaPP isoform using exogenous promoters.

22459190|a|The influence of nanoparticles of various sizes and surface functionalities on the self-assembling fibrillogenesis of beta-amyloid (1-40) peptide was investigated. Functionalized nanoparticles including quantum dots and gold nanoparticles were co-incubated with monomeric Abeta(1-40) peptides under seed-mediated growth method to study their influences on the elongation phase of the fibrillogenesis. It is observed that charge-to-surface area ratio of the nanoparticles and the functional moiety and electrostatic charges of the conjugated ligands on the particle surfaces took crucial regulatory role in the Abeta(1-40) fibrillogenesis.

22460296|t|Cerebrospinal fluid beta-amyloid 1-42 correlates with rate of progression in Alzheimer's disease.
22460296|a|Emerging treatment options targeting the pathogenetic mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the need to monitor efficacy during treatment trials necessitate the use of biomarkers, which not only may facilitate early and reliable diagnosis, but may also assist in the stratification of patient populations according to their rate of progression. The objective of the present study is to examine whether demographic and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) parameters at initial evaluation [total tau, tau phosphorylated at threonine-181 and amyloid-beta(1-42) (Abeta42)] can be used to discriminate between slow and rapid progressors in patients with AD. A total of 74 AD patients were included in the study. Patients recruited were divided into slow and rapid progressors according to their Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score decline before evaluation. Patients with a drop rate of >4/year were considered rapid progressors. Commercially available ELISA kits were used for measuring CSF biomarkers. Comparisons were performed using analysis of covariance. Significantly lower Abeta42 levels in the CSF were found in rapid (mean 392 pg/ml) as compared to slow progressors (mean 453 pg/ml), with a p value of 0.042. The results of the present study suggest that levels of the Abeta42 peptide may be related to the rate of disease progression. Further studies with a prospective design are needed in order to test the possible predictive value of CSF Abeta42 analysis.

22460324|t|Aminoterminally truncated and oxidized amyloid-beta peptides in the cerebrospinal fluid of Alzheimer's disease patients.
22460324|a|Carboxyterminally elongated and aminoterminally truncated amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides and their oxidized derivates are major constituents of human amyloid plaques. The objective of the present study was to clarify the diagnostic impact of the Abeta peptides 1-38ox, 2-40, and 2-42 peptides on the neurochemical cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). For this purpose, 22 patients with AD and 20 non-demented disease controls (NDC) were comparatively analyzed for their cerebrospinal fluid pattern of Abeta1-38ox, Abeta2-40, and Abeta2-42 along with Abeta1-37, Abeta1-38, Abeta1-39, Abeta1-40, Abeta1-40ox, and Abeta1-42 using a novel sequential aminoterminally and carboxyterminally specific immunoprecipitation protocol and subsequent analysis in the Abeta-SDS-PAGE/immunoblot. The Abeta peptides 1-38ox, 2-40, and 2-42 could not be consistently detected in the investigated CSF samples, which applied to samples from AD and NDC patients alike. Otherwise, our approach revealed a striking decrease of Abeta1-42 and Abeta2-42, but not of Abeta1-38ox and Abeta2-40 in AD. Both Abeta1-42 and Abeta2-42 reached reasonable accuracies for diagnosing AD alone as well as in relation to Abeta1-40, Abeta1-38, or the sum of all measured Abeta peptides. Abeta1-38ox was negatively correlated to the Mini-Mental Status Examination score of AD patients, indicating that this peptide to linked to disease severity. We conclude that an exact analysis of CSF Abeta peptides regarding their carboxy- and aminoterminus as well as posttranslational modification may be a promising approach for diagnosing and tracking AD.

22460331|t|Efficient near-infrared in vivo imaging of amyoid-beta deposits in Alzheimer's disease mouse models.
22460331|a|The development of early diagnostic and prognostic tools for the visualization of amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposits is one important focus of current imaging research. In patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), non-invasive and efficient detection of soluble and aggregated Abeta is important to determine the immediate success of intervention trails. The novel near infrared-fluorescence (NIRF) probe THK-265 efficiently penetrates the blood-brain barrier and has a strong and efficient binding to cerebral Abeta. Ex vivo microscopy of i) THK-265-labeling of plaques in paraffin-embedded tissue and ii) cerebral cryo-sections after intravenous injection of THK-265 confirmed a systematic increase of the NIRF signal corresponding to Abeta plaque number and size during disease progression. Furthermore, we investigated different stages of plaque formation in amyloid-beta protein precursor transgenic mice in vivo after intravenous application of THK-265 to evaluate different aggregation levels with NIRF signals. The intensity of the NIRF signal correlated well with the plaque burden, indicating its utility for direct monitoring of Abeta aggregation progression. In summary, our results support the use of the NIRF probe THK-265 for the diagnosis and direct visualization of amyloid deposits and open the possibility for efficient, pre-symptomatic monitoring of Abeta deposition in the aging brain.

22461629|t|Small amphipathic molecules modulate secondary structure and amyloid fibril-forming kinetics of Alzheimer disease peptide Abeta(1-42).
22461629|a|Amyloid fibril formation is associated with a number of debilitating systemic and neurodegenerative diseases. One of the most prominent is Alzheimer disease in which aggregation and deposition of the Abeta peptide occur. Abeta is widely considered to mediate the extensive neuronal loss observed in this disease through the formation of soluble oligomeric species, with the final fibrillar end product of the aggregation process being relatively inert. Factors that influence the aggregation of these amyloid-forming proteins are therefore very important. We have screened a library of 96 amphipathic molecules for effects on Abeta(1-42) aggregation and self-association. We find, using thioflavin T fluorescence and electron microscopy assays, that 30 of the molecules inhibit the aggregation process, whereas 36 activate fibril formation. Several activators and inhibitors were subjected to further analysis using analytical ultracentrifugation and circular dichroism. Activators typically display a 1:10 peptide:detergent stoichiometry for maximal activation, whereas the inhibitors are effective at a 1:1 stoichiometry. Analytical ultracentrifugation and circular dichroism experiments show that activators promote a mixture of unfolded and beta-sheet structures and rapidly form large aggregates, whereas inhibitors induce alpha-helical structures that form stable dimeric/trimeric oligomers. The results suggest that Abeta(1-42) contains at least one small molecule binding site, which modulates the secondary structure and aggregation processes. Further studies of the binding of these compounds to Abeta may provide insight for developing therapeutic strategies aimed at stabilizing Abeta in a favorable conformation.

22461632|t|Expression in drosophila of tandem amyloid beta peptides provides insights into links between aggregation and neurotoxicity.
22461632|a|The generation and subsequent aggregation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides play a crucial initiating role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD). The two main isoforms of these peptides have 40 (Abeta(40)) or 42 residues (Abeta(42)), the latter having a higher propensity to aggregate in vitro and being the main component of the plaques observed in vivo in AD patients. We have designed a series of tandem dimeric constructs of these Abeta peptides to probe the manner in which changes in the aggregation kinetics of Abeta affect its deposition and toxicity in a Drosophila melanogaster model system. The levels of insoluble aggregates were found to be substantially elevated in flies expressing the tandem constructs of both Abeta(40) and Abeta(42) compared with the equivalent monomeric peptides, consistent with the higher effective concentration, and hence increased aggregation rate, of the peptides in the tandem repeat. A unique feature of the Abeta(42) constructs, however, is the appearance of high levels of soluble oligomeric aggregates and a corresponding dramatic increase in their in vivo toxicity. The toxic nature of the Abeta(42) peptide in vivo can therefore be attributed to the higher kinetic stability of the oligomeric intermediate states that it populates relative to those of Abeta(40) rather than simply to its higher rate of aggregation.

22463693|t|Neuropathological, clinical and molecular pathology in female fragile X premutation carriers with and without FXTAS.
22463693|a|Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder associated with premutation alleles of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Approximately 40% of older male premutation carriers, and a smaller proportion of females, are affected by FXTAS; due to the lower penetrance the characterization of the disorder in females is much less detailed. Core clinical features of FXTAS include intention tremor, cerebellar gait ataxia and frequently parkinsonism, autonomic dysfunction and cognitive deficits progressing to dementia in up to 50% of males. In this study, we report the clinical, molecular and neuropathological findings of eight female premutation carriers. Significantly, four of these women had dementia; of the four, three had FXTAS plus dementia. Post-mortem examination showed the presence of intranuclear inclusions in all eight cases, which included one asymptomatic premutation carrier who died from cancer. Among the four subjects with dementia, three had sufficient number of cortical amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles to make Alzheimer's disease a highly likely cause of dementia and a fourth case had dementia with cortical Lewy bodies. Dementia appears to be more common than originally reported in females with FXTAS. Although further studies are required, our observation suggests that in a portion of FXTAS cases there is Alzheimer pathology and perhaps a synergistic effect on the progression of the disease may occur.

22464332|t|Proline isomer-specific antibodies reveal the early pathogenic tau conformation in Alzheimer's disease.
22464332|a|cis-trans isomerization of proteins phosphorylated by proline-directed kinases is proposed to control numerous signaling molecules and is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's and other diseases. However, there is no direct evidence for the existence of cis-trans protein isomers in vivo or for their conformation-specific function or regulation. Here we develop peptide chemistries that allow the generation of cis- and trans-specific antibodies and use them to raise antibodies specific for isomers of phosphorylated tau. cis, but not trans, p-tau appears early in the brains of humans with mild cognitive impairment, accumulates exclusively in degenerated neurons, and localizes to dystrophic neurites during Alzheimer's progression. Unlike trans p-tau, the cis isomer cannot promote microtubule assembly, is more resistant to dephosphorylation and degradation, and is more prone to aggregation. Pin1 converts cis to trans p-tau to prevent Alzheimer's tau pathology. Isomer-specific antibodies and vaccines may therefore have value for the early diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

22466002|t|Changes in brain transcripts related to Alzheimer's disease in a model of HFE hemochromatosis are not consistent with increased Alzheimer's disease risk.
22466002|a|Iron abnormalities are observed in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, but it is unclear whether common disorders of systemic iron overload such as hemochromatosis alter risks of AD. We used microarrays and real-time reverse transcription-PCR to investigate changes in the brain transcriptome of adult Hfe-/- mice, a model of hemochromatosis, relative to age- and gender-matched wildtype controls. Classification by functional pathway analysis revealed transcript changes for various genes important in AD. There were decreases of up to 9-fold in transcripts for amyloid-beta protein precursor, tau, apolipoprotein E, presenilin 1, and various other gamma-secretase components, as well as Notch signaling pathway molecules. This included decreased transcripts for 'hairy and enhancer of split' Hes1 and Hes5, downstream targets of Notch canonical signaling. The reductions in Hes1 and Hes5 transcripts provide evidence that the changes in levels of transcripts for gamma-secretase components and Notch signaling genes have functional consequences. The effects appeared relatively specific for AD in that few genes pertaining to other important neurodegenerative diseases, notably Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease, or to inflammation, oxidative stress, or apoptosis, showed altered transcript levels. The observed effects on AD-related gene transcripts do not appear to be consistent with increased AD risk in HFE hemochromatosis and might, if anything, be predicted to protect against AD to some extent. As Hfe-/- mice did not have higher brain iron levels than wildtype controls, these studies highlight the need for further research in models of more severe hemochromatosis with brain iron loading.

22466806|t|Biochemical characterization of recombinant methionine aminopeptidases (MAPs) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv.
22466806|a|Methionine aminopeptidase (MAP) performs the essential post-translational N-terminal methionine excision (NME) of nascent polypeptides during protein synthesis. To characterize MAP from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, two homolgues, mapA (Rv0734) and mapB (Rv2861c), were over expressed and purified as recombinant proteins in E. coli. In vitro activity assay of apo-MtbMAPs using L-Met-p-nitro anilide as substrate revealed MtbMAP A to be catalytically more efficient compared to MtbMAP B. Ni(2+) was the best activator of apo-MtbMAP A, whereas Ni(2+) and Co(2+) activated apo-MtbMAP B equally. MtbMAP B showed higher thermo-stability, but was feedback inhibited by higher concentrations of L-methionine. Aminopeptidase inhibitors like actinonin and bestatin inhibited both MtbMAPs, more prominently MtbMAP B. Among the site-directed mutants of MtbMAP B, substitution of metal-binding residue D142 completely abolished enzyme activity, whereas substitution of residues forming S1' pocket, C105S and T94C, had only moderate effects on substrate hydrolysis. Present study identified a specific insertion region in MtbMAP A sequence which differentiates it from other bacterial and eukaryotic MAPs. A deletion mutant lacking amino acids from this insertion region (MtbMAP A- 164-176) was constructed to probe into their structural and functional role in activity and stability of MtbMAP A. The limited success in soluble expression of this deletion mutant suggests further optimizations of expression conditions or alternative bioinformatics approaches for further characterization of this deletion mutant of MtbMAP A.

22468639|a|A series of potent hydroxyethyl amine (HEA) derived inhibitors of beta-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE1) was optimized to address suboptimal pharmacokinetics and poor CNS partitioning.

Subsequent efforts focused on improving CNS exposure by limiting susceptibility to Pgp-mediated efflux and identified an inhibitor which demonstrated robust and sustained reduction of CNS beta-amyloid (Abeta) in Sprague-Dawley rats following oral administration.

22472273|t|Alzheimer's disease 2012: the great amyloid gamble.
22472273|a|Alzheimer's disease threatens to become the scourge of the 21st century. Hundreds of millions of aging people throughout the world are at risk, but it is clear that the disease encompasses more than just the natural aging process. Deposits of amyloid beta peptides in the brains of demented individuals are a defining feature of the disease, yet two decades of intensive investigation, focusing on reducing or removing amyloid deposits, have failed to produce any meaningful therapeutic interventions. Some researchers question whether amyloid is the appropriate target. Others maintain that early, presymptomatic intervention would be a more informative test, and propose large-scale clinical trials in patients who are believed to be in the earliest, and potentially reversible, stages of the disease. This review explores the wisdom of that approach.

22472730|t|Comparison of lactulose and glucose breath test for diagnosis of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
22472730|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Validity of the lactulose breath test (LBT) to diagnose small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) has been questioned. Therefore, a study was planned to compare LBT with glucose breath test (GBT) to diagnose SIBO in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients and controls. METHODS: 175 diarrhea-predominant IBS patients and 150 apparently healthy controls were enrolled. IBS was diagnosed according to Rome II criteria. Breath samples were collected every 10 min up to 180 min. Breath H2 and CH4 were measured using an SC MicroLyzer. SIBO was positive with a sustained increase in breath H2 or CH4 or both >=10 ppm over a baseline value within <90 min in case of LBT and within <120 min in GBT. RESULTS: SIBO was positive in 60/175 (34.3%) patients by lactulose and in 11/175 (6.2%) patients by GBT. In controls, LBT was positive for SIBO in 45/150 (30%) patients and in 1/150 (0.66%) patients by GBT. Positive LBT for SIBO was not significantly different in patients and controls; while using GBT, SIBO was significantly higher (p < 0.01) in patients as compared to controls. By using GBT as gold standard for SIBO, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of LBT in IBS patients was 63.6, 67.7, 11.7 and 96.6% respectively. CONCLUSION: LBT is not a good test to discriminate SIBO in IBS patients from controls.

22473767|t|Translational research in neurology: dementia.
22473767|a|Dementia disorders are characterized by clinicopathological criteria. Molecular understandings of these disorders, based on immunohistochemical studies, biochemical investigations, genetic approaches, and animal models, have resulted in advances in diagnosis. Likewise, translational research has allowed us to apply our increasing basic scientific knowledge of neurodegeneration to the rational development of new investigational therapies based on our current understanding of disease pathogenesis. This review discusses the application of translational research to both diagnosis and treatment of dementia disorders. The development of biomarkers has yielded imaging and biochemical methods that assist the physician more than ever in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementias, especially Alzheimer disease. New diagnostic criteria for disease are based on these molecular-based techniques. And these biomarkers are of potential use in monitoring disease activity during therapeutic trials. Translational investigations likewise have led toward new avenues in targeted dementia research. This is particularly so in the development and testing of disease-modifying treatments that might slow or deter progressive deterioration. Recent clinical trials have not been based on empirical trials of established drugs but, rather, on trials of drugs shown, through experiments in biochemical, cell culture, and animal models, to interfere with known elements of the pathogenetic cascade of Alzheimer disease.

Therefore, biomarkers are essential to prove that an anti-beta-amyloid (Abeta) drug candidate affects both Abeta metabolism and plaque load as well as downstream pathogenic mechanisms. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of the anti-Abeta monoclonal antibody bapineuzumab on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers reflecting Abeta homeostasis, neuronal degeneration, and tau-related pathology in patients with Alzheimer disease. DESIGN: Two phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 12-month duration. SETTING: Academic centers in the United States (Study 201) and England and Finland (Study 202). PATIENTS: Forty-six patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received either placebo (n = 19) or bapineuzumab (n = 27) in 3 or 4 ascending dose groups. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes between end of study and baseline in the exploratory CSF biomarkers Abeta1-42, AbetaX-42, AbetaX-40; total tau (T-tau); and phosphorylated tau (P-tau). RESULTS: Within the bapineuzumab group, a decrease at end of study compared with baseline was found both for CSF T-tau (-72.3 pg/mL) and P-tau (-9.9 pg/mL). When comparing the treatment and placebo groups, this difference was statistically significant for P-tau (P = .03), while a similar trend for a decrease was found for T-tau (P = .09). No clear-cut differences were observed for CSF Abeta. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this study is the first to show that passive Abeta immunotherapy with bapineuzumab results in decreases in CSF T-tau and P-tau, which may indicate downstream effects on the degenerative process. Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers may be useful to monitor the effects of novel disease-modifying anti-Abeta drugs in clinical trials.

22473881|t|Quantifying amyloid beta (Abeta)-mediated changes in neuronal morphology in primary cultures: implications for phenotypic screening.
22473881|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease affecting millions of people. The amyloid hypothesis suggests that the pathogenesis of AD is related to the accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) in the brain. Herein, the authors quantify Abeta-mediated changes in neuronal morphology in primary cultures using the Cellomics neuronal profiling version 3.5 (NPv3.5) BioApplication. We observed that Abeta caused a 33% decrease in neurite length in primary human cortical cultures after 24 h of treatment compared with control-treated cultures. We also determined that quantifying changes of neuronal morphology was a more sensitive indicator of nonlethal cell injury than traditional cytotoxicity assays. Abeta-mediated neuronal deficits observed in human cortical cultures were also observed in primary rat hippocampal cultures, where we demonstrated that the integrin-blocking antibody, 17E6, completely abrogated Abeta-mediated cytotoxicity. Finally, we showed that Abeta challenge to 21 days in vitro rat hippocampal cultures reduced synapsin staining to 14% of control-treated cultures. These results are consistent with the finding that loss of presynaptic integrity is one of the initial deficits observed in AD. The implementation of phenotypic screens to identify compounds that block Abeta-mediated cytotoxicity in primary neuronal cultures may lead to the development of novel strategies to prevent AD.

22473957|t|The hypoxia imaging agent CuII(atsm) is neuroprotective and improves motor and cognitive functions in multiple animal models of Parkinson's disease.
22473957|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive, chronic disease characterized by dyskinesia, rigidity, instability, and tremors. The disease is defined by the presence of Lewy bodies, which primarily consist of aggregated alpha-synuclein protein, and is accompanied by the loss of monoaminergic neurons. Current therapeutic strategies only give symptomatic relief of motor impairment and do not address the underlying neurodegeneration. Hence, we have identified Cu(II)(atsm) as a potential therapeutic for PD. Drug administration to four different animal models of PD resulted in improved motor and cognition function, rescued nigral cell loss, and improved dopamine metabolism. In vitro, this compound is able to inhibit the effects of peroxynitrite-driven toxicity, including the formation of nitrated alpha-synuclein oligomers. Our results show that Cu(II)(atsm) is effective in reversing parkinsonian defects in animal models and has the potential to be a successful treatment of PD.

22474609|t|The neuropsychological profile of Alzheimer disease.
22474609|a|Neuropsychological assessment has featured prominently over the past 30 years in the characterization of dementia associated with Alzheimer disease (AD). Clinical neuropsychological methods have identified the earliest, most definitive cognitive and behavioral symptoms of illness, contributing to the identification, staging, and tracking of disease. With increasing public awareness of dementia, disease detection has moved to earlier stages of illness, at a time when deficits are both behaviorally and pathologically selective. For reasons that are not well understood, early AD pathology frequently targets large-scale neuroanatomical networks for episodic memory before other networks that subserve language, attention, executive functions, and visuospatial abilities. This chapter reviews the pathognomonic neuropsychological features of AD dementia and how these differ from "normal," age-related cognitive decline and from other neurodegenerative diseases that cause dementia, including cortical Lewy body disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and cerebrovascular disease.

22474610|t|Brain imaging in Alzheimer disease.
22474610|a|Imaging has played a variety of roles in the study of Alzheimer disease (AD) over the past four decades. Initially, computed tomography (CT) and then magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were used diagnostically to rule out other causes of dementia. More recently, a variety of imaging modalities including structural and functional MRI and positron emission tomography (PET) studies of cerebral metabolism with fluoro-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG) and amyloid tracers such as Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB) have shown characteristic changes in the brains of patients with AD, and in prodromal and even presymptomatic states that can help rule-in the AD pathophysiological process. No one imaging modality can serve all purposes as each have unique strengths and weaknesses. These modalities and their particular utilities are discussed in this article. The challenge for the future will be to combine imaging biomarkers to most efficiently facilitate diagnosis, disease staging, and, most importantly, development of effective disease-modifying therapies.

22475448|t|Engineered antibody approaches for Alzheimer's disease immunotherapy.
22475448|a|The accumulation of amyloid-beta-peptide (Abeta or A-beta) in the brain is considered to be a key event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Over the last decade, antibody strategies aimed at reducing high levels of Abeta in the brain and or neutralizing its toxic effects have emerged as one of the most promising treatments for AD. Early approaches using conventional antibody formats demonstrated the potential of immunotherapy, but also caused a range of undesirable side effects such meningoencephalitis, vasogenic edema or cerebral microhemorrhages in both murine and humans. This prompted the exploration of alternative approaches using engineered antibodies to avoid adverse immunological responses and provide a safer and more effective therapy. Encouraging results have been obtained using a range of recombinant antibody formats including, single chain antibodies, antibody domains, intrabodies, bispecific antibodies as well as Fc-engineered antibodies in transgenic AD mouse and primate models. This review will address recent progress using these recombinant antibodies against Abeta, highlighting their advantages over conventional monoclonal antibodies and delivery methods.

22475489|t|Identification of distinct physiochemical properties of toxic prefibrillar species formed by Abeta peptide variants.
22475489|a|The formation of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) aggregates at an early stage during the self-assembly process is an important factor in the development of Alzheimer's disease. The toxic effect is believed to be exerted by prefibrillar species of Abeta. It is therefore important to identify which prefibrillar species are toxic and characterize their distinct properties. In the present study, we investigated the in vitro aggregation behavior of Abeta-derived peptides possessing different levels of neurotoxic activity, using fluorescence spectroscopy in combination with transmission electron microscopy. The toxicity of various Abeta aggregates was assessed by using cultures of human neuroblastoma cells. Through combined use of the fluorescence probe 8-anilino-1-napthalenesulfonate (ANS) and the novel luminescent probe pentamer formyl thiophene acetic acid (p-FTAA), we were able to identify those Abeta peptide-derived prefibrillar species which exhibited cellular toxicity. In particular, species, which formed early during the aggregation process and showed strong p-FTAA and ANS fluorescence, were the species that possessed toxic activities. Moreover, by manipulating the aggregation conditions, it was possible to change the capacity of the Abeta peptide to form nontoxic versus toxic species.

22475796|t|Longitudinal cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers over four years in mild cognitive impairment.
22475796|a|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measurements of amyloid-beta42 (Abeta42), total-tau (T-tau), and phosphorylated tau (P-tau) may be used to predict future Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The precise temporal development of these biomarkers in relation to clinical progression is unclear. Earlier studies have been hampered by short follow-up. In an MCI cohort, we selected 15 patients who developed AD (MCI-AD) and 15 who remained cognitively stable during 4 years of follow-up. CSF was sampled at three serial occasions from each patient and analyzed for Abeta peptides, the soluble amyloid-beta protein precursor protein fragments sAbetaPPalpha and sAbetaPPbeta, T-tau, P-tau, and chromogranin B, which is a protein linked to regulated neuronal secretion. We also measured, for the first time in MCI patients, an extended panel of Abeta peptides by matrix-assisted-laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MS). Most biomarkers were surprisingly stable over the four years with coefficients of variation below or close to 10%. However, MCI-AD patients decreased in CSF AbetaX-40 and chromogranin B concentrations, which may indicate a reduced number of functional neurons or synapses with disease progression. The MS Abeta peptide panel was more useful than any single Abeta peptide to identify MCI-AD patients already at baseline. Knowledge on these biomarkers and their trajectories may facilitate early diagnosis of AD and be useful in future clinical trials to track effects of disease modifying drugs.

22475801|t|Dimebon ameliorates amyloid-beta induced impairments of mitochondrial form and function.
22475801|a|Due to their role in producing energy, as major sources of free radicals, and as critical regulators of apoptosis, mitochondria play a dominant role in the central nervous system (CNS). Mitochondrial dysfunction represents one major pathomechanism of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including impaired function of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes and deficits of mitochondrial dynamics, such as impaired balance between fission and fusion mechanisms and reduced mitochondrial trafficking. Major consequences are enhanced depletion of mitochondria in axons and dendrites, synaptic dysfunction, and finally neuronal loss. Interfering with impaired mitochondrial dynamics has been proposed as novel strategy for antidementia drugs. Dimebon has been shown to improve cognition in animal models and seems to be beneficial in AD patients. Regardless of the final proof of Dimebon's clinical efficacy, it might specifically interfere with mechanisms relevant for the cognitive decline, especially by improving impaired mitochondrial function and/or dynamics in AD. Herein, we tested the effects of Dimebon on mitochondrial function and dynamics in a cellular model, overexpressing neurotoxic Abeta peptides, one of the hallmarks of AD. Dimebon exerted pronounced effects on mitochondrial morphology, respiratory chain complex activities, and enlarged mitochondrial mass. In summary, form and function of mitochondria are altered in the Abeta overexpressing cell model and precisely those changes are restored by nanomolar Dimebon treatment. Our findings support the idea that Dimebon improves mitochondrial function and that these "disease specific" effects might be relevant for interpretation and planning of future clinical trials.

22476196|t|An anti-diabetes agent protects the mouse brain from defective insulin signaling caused by Alzheimer's disease- associated Abeta oligomers.
22476196|a|Defective brain insulin signaling has been suggested to contribute to the cognitive deficits in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although a connection between AD and diabetes has been suggested, a major unknown is the mechanism(s) by which insulin resistance in the brain arises in individuals with AD. Here, we show that serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (IRS-1pSer) is common to both diseases. Brain tissue from humans with AD had elevated levels of IRS-1pSer and activated JNK, analogous to what occurs in peripheral tissue in patients with diabetes. We found that amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) oligomers, synaptotoxins that accumulate in the brains of AD patients, activated the JNK/TNF-alpha pathway, induced IRS-1 phosphorylation at multiple serine residues, and inhibited physiological IRS-1pTyr in mature cultured hippocampal neurons. Impaired IRS-1 signaling was also present in the hippocampi of Tg mice with a brain condition that models AD. Importantly, intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta oligomers triggered hippocampal IRS-1pSer and JNK activation in cynomolgus monkeys. The oligomer-induced neuronal pathologies observed in vitro, including impaired axonal transport, were prevented by exposure to exendin-4 (exenatide), an anti-diabetes agent. In Tg mice, exendin-4 decreased levels of hippocampal IRS-1pSer and activated JNK and improved behavioral measures of cognition. By establishing molecular links between the dysregulated insulin signaling in AD and diabetes, our results open avenues for the investigation of new therapeutics in AD.

22476982|t|Protective effects of curcumin on amyloid-beta-induced neuronal oxidative damage.
22476982|a|To investigate the protective effects of curcumin against amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced neuronal damage. Primary rat cortical neurons were cultured with different treatments of Abeta and curcumin. Neuronal morphologies, viability and damage were assessed. Neuronal oxidative stress was assessed, including extracellular hydrogen peroxide and intracellular reactive oxygen species. The abilities of curcumin to scavenge free radicals and to inhibit Abeta aggregation and beta-sheeted formation are further assessed and discussed. Curcumin preserves cell viability, which is decreased by Abeta. The results of changed morphology, released Lactate dehydrogenases and cell viability assays indicate that curcumin protects Abeta-induced neuronal damage. Curcumin depresses Abeta-induced up-regulation of neuronal oxidative stress. The treatment sequence impacts the protective effect of curcumin on Abeta-induced neuronal damage. Curcumin shows a more protective effect on neuronal oxidative damage when curcumin was added into cultured neurons not later than Abeta, especially prior to Abeta. The abilities of curcumin to scavenge free radicals and to inhibit the formation of beta-sheeted aggregation are both beneficial to depress Abeta-induced oxidative damage. Curcumin prevents neurons from Abeta-induced oxidative damage, implying the therapeutic usage for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease patients.

22477259|t|Intracellular accumulation of aggregated pyroglutamate amyloid beta: convergence of aging and Abeta pathology at the lysosome.
22477259|a|Deposition of aggregated amyloid beta (Abeta) is a major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-a common age-related neurodegenerative disorder. Typically, Abeta is generated as a peptide of varying lengths. However, a major fraction of Abeta peptides in the brains of AD patients has undergone posttranslational modifications, which often radically change the properties of the peptides. Abeta3(pE)-42 is an N-truncated, pyroglutamate-modified variant that is abundantly present in AD brain and was suggested to play a role early in the pathogenesis. Here we show that intracellular accumulation of oligomeric aggregates of Abeta3(pE)-42 results in loss of lysosomal integrity. Using a novel antibody specific for aggregates of AbetapE3, we show that in postmortem human brain tissue, aggregated AbetapE3 is predominantly found in the lysosomes of both neurons and glial cells. Our data further demonstrate that AbetapE3 is relatively resistant to lysosomal degradation, which may explain its accumulation in the lysosomes. The intracellular AbetapE3 aggregates increase in an age-dependent manner. The results presented in this study support a model where Abeta pathology and aging converge, leading to accumulation of the degradation-resistant pE-modified Abeta in the lysosomes, lysosomal dysfunction, and neurodegeneration.

22480599|t|Evidence supporting the role of calpain in the alpha-processing of amyloid-beta precursor protein.
22480599|a|Amyloid plaques are a hallmark of the aging and senile dementia brains, yet their mechanism of origins has remained elusive. A central issue is the regulatory mechanism and identity of alpha-secretase, a protease responsible for alpha-processing of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP). A remarkable feature of this enzyme is its high sensitivity to a wide range of cellular stimulators, many of which are agonists for Ca(2+) signaling. This feature, together with previous work in our laboratory, has suggested that calpain, a Ca(2+)-dependent protease, plays a key role in APP alpha-processing. In this study we report that overexpression of the mu-calpain gene in HEK293 cells resulted in a 2.7-fold increase of the protein levels. Measurements of intracellular calpain enzymatic activity revealed that the calpain overexpressing cells displayed a prominent elevation of the activity compared to wild-type cells. When the cells were stimulated by nicotine, glutamate or phorbol 12,13-dibutylester, the activity increase was even more remarkable and sensitive to calpeptin, a calpain inhibitor. Meanwhile, APP secretion from the calpain overexpressing cells was robustly increased under both resting and stimulated conditions over wild-type cells. Furthermore, cell surface biotinylation experiments showed that mu-calpain was clearly detected among the cell surface proteins. These data together support our view that calpain should be a reasonable candidate for alpha-secretase for further study. This model is discussed with an interesting fact that three other deposited proteins (tau, spectrin and crystalline) are also the known substrates of calpain. Finally we discuss some current misconceptions in senile dementia research.

22481485|t|The dynamics of Abeta distribution after gamma-secretase inhibitor treatment, as determined by experimental and modelling approaches in a wild type rat.
22481485|a|Inhibition of the enzyme(s) that produce the Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide, namely BACE and gamma-secretase, is considered an attractive target for Alzheimer's disease therapy. However, the optimal pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling method to describe the changes in Abeta levels after drug treatment is unclear. In this study, turnover models were employed to describe Abeta levels following treatment with the gamma-secretase inhibitor RO5036450, in the wild type rat. Initially, Abeta level changes in the brain, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and plasma were modeled as separate biological compartments, which allowed the estimation of a compound IC50 and Abeta turnover. While the data were well described, the model did not take into consideration that the CSF pool of Abeta most likely originates from the brain via the CSF drainage pathway. Therefore, a separate model was carried out, with the assumption that CSF Abeta levels originated from the brain. The optimal model that described the data involved two brain Abeta 40 sub-compartments, one with a rapid turnover, from which CSF Abeta 40 is derived, and a second quasi-static pool of ~20%. Importantly, the estimated in vivo brain IC50 was in a good range of the in vitro IC50 (ratio, 1.4). In conclusion, the PK/PD models presented here are well suited for describing the temporal changes in Abeta levels that occur after treatment with an Abeta lowering drug, and identifying physiological parameters.

22483923|t|Peptide-based electrochemical biosensor for amyloid beta 1-42 soluble oligomer assay.
22483923|a|Based on oligopeptide, a novel strategy to fabricate electrochemical biosensor is proposed in this work by fine-tuning the scan pulse frequency of square wave voltammetry (SWV) to synchronize with the surface electron transfer (ET) of the oligopeptide modified on an electrode surface. By using this strategy, the surface ET dynamics of our peptide-based biosensor can show significant difference in the presence and absence of a detection target, thus the proposed strategy has been employed for the assay of amyloid beta 1-42 (Abeta 1-42) soluble oligomer, which is among the most neurotoxic species of Abeta peptide. Experimental results reveal that our sensor might be an appropriate candidate for quantitative assay of Abeta 1-42 soluble oligomer. Moreover, the strategy proposed in this work may be extended for the fabrication of more peptide-based biosensors in the future.

22486153|t|Structure and dynamics of small soluble Abeta(1-40) oligomers studied by top-down hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry.
22486153|a|Abeta peptides can assemble into amyloid fibrils, which represent one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies, however, have focused on the behavior of small soluble Abeta oligomers that possess a much greater neurotoxicity than mature fibrils. The structural characterization of these oligomers remains difficult because of their highly dynamic and polymorphic nature. This work explores the behavior of Abeta(1-40) in a slightly basic solution (pH 9.3) at a low salt concentration (10 mM ammonium acetate). These conditions lead to the formation of small oligomers, without any signs of fibrillation for several hours. The structure and dynamics of these oligomers were characterized by circular dichroism spectroscopy, size exclusion chromatography, and millisecond time-resolved hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry (MS). Our results reveal rapid interconversion between Abeta(1-40) oligomers and monomers. The mole fraction of monomeric molecules is on the order of 40%. Oligomers consist of ~4 Abeta(1-40) molecules on average, and the resulting assemblies have a predominantly beta-sheet secondary structure. Hydrogen exchange proceeds in the EX1 regime. This feature allows the application of conformer-specific top-down MS. Electron capture dissociation is used for interrogating the deuteration behavior of the Abeta(1-40) oligomers. This approach provides a spatial resolution of ~2 residues. The backbone amide deuteration pattern uncovered in this way is consistent with a beta-turn-beta motif for L17-M35. The N-terminus is involved in hydrogen bonding, as well, whereas protection gradually tapers off for C-terminal residues 35-40. Our data are consistent with earlier proposals, according to which Abeta(1-40) oligomers adopt a beta-barrel structure. In general terms, this study demonstrates how top-down MS with precursor ion selection can be employed for structural studies of specific protein conformers within a heterogeneous mix.

22486774|t|Extensive p-tau pathology and SDS-stable p-tau oligomers in Alzheimer's cortical synapses.
22486774|a|Like amyloid beta (Abeta) oligomers, tau aggregates are increasingly recognized as potential key toxic intermediates in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and as therapeutic targets. P-tau co-localizes with Abeta in cortical AD synapses and may contribute to synapse dysfunction and loss. Flow cytometry analysis of synaptosomes from AD compared with aged cognitively normal cortex demonstrates increased immunolabeling for three p-tau antibodies (AT8, PHF-1 and pS422), indicating phosphorylation at multiple tau epitopes. Sequential extraction experiments show increased soluble p-tau in AD synapses, but a sizable pool of p-tau requires detergent solubilization, suggesting endosomal/lysosomal localization. P-tau is co-localized with Abeta in individual synaptosomes in dual labeling experiments, and flow cytometry sorting of Abeta-positive synaptosomes from an AD case reveals a marked enrichment of p-tau aggregates. The p-tau enrichment, a 76-fold increase over the initial homogenate, is consistent with sequestration of p-tau in internal synaptic compartments. Western analysis of a series of AD and normal cases shows SDS-stable tau oligomers in the dimer/trimer size range in AD samples. These results indicate that widespread synaptic p-tau pathology accompanies Abeta accumulations in surviving synaptic terminals, particularly in late-stage AD.

22487315|t|On the use of size exclusion chromatography for the resolution of mixed amyloid aggregate distributions: I. equilibrium partition models.
22487315|a|In this study, we investigated the theoretical potential of size exclusion chromatography (SEC) for resolving mixtures of protein aggregates (of various sizes and shapes) produced in the generation of amyloid fibrils. We present our findings in the form of an equilibrium partition model. We first review the general characteristics of SEC and discuss the physicochemical features affecting solute transport and partition. We then develop new methods for estimating the transport and partition coefficients of protein aggregates on the basis of their molecular dimensions and the SEC column properties. We detail how these calculated properties can be used to estimate the likely resolving power of an SEC column. Model predictions were found to be in general agreement with experimental data gained from the measurement of the elution profile of sheared amyloid fibrils prepared from bovine insulin and passed through a Superose 6 precision SEC column. Our formalism should provide a basic appreciation of the competing factors at work and allow an informed choice to be made for optimal selection of SEC column medium to separate a desired size range of aggregate.

22487856|t|Correlation of Alzheimer disease neuropathologic changes with cognitive status:  a review of the literature.
22487856|a|Clinicopathologic correlation studies are critically important for the field of Alzheimer disease (AD) research. Studies on human subjects with autopsy confirmation entail numerous potential biases that affect both their general applicability and the validity of the correlations. Many sources of data variability can weaken the apparent correlation between cognitive status and AD neuropathologic changes. Indeed, most persons in advanced old age have significant non-AD brain lesions that may alter cognition independently of AD. Worldwide research efforts have evaluated thousands of human subjects to assess the causes of cognitive impairment in the elderly, and these studies have been interpreted in different ways. We review the literature focusing on the correlation of AD neuropathologic changes (i.e. beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles) with cognitive impairment. We discuss the various patterns of brain changes that have been observed in elderly individuals to provide a perspective for understanding AD clinicopathologic correlation and conclude that evidence from many independent research centers strongly supports the existence of a specific disease, as defined by the presence of Abeta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Although Abeta plaques may play a key role in AD pathogenesis, the severity of cognitive impairment correlates best with the burden of neocortical neurofibrillary tangles.

22488240|t|An operational approach to National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association criteria for preclinical Alzheimer disease.
22488240|a|OBJECTIVE: A workgroup commissioned by the Alzheimer's Association (AA) and the National Institute on Aging (NIA) recently published research criteria for preclinical Alzheimer disease (AD). We performed a preliminary assessment of these guidelines. METHODS: We employed Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography (PET) imaging as our biomarker of cerebral amyloidosis, and (18) fluorodeoxyglucose PET imaging and hippocampal volume as biomarkers of neurodegeneration. A group of 42 clinically diagnosed AD subjects was used to create imaging biomarker cutpoints. A group of 450 cognitively normal (CN) subjects from a population-based sample was used to develop cognitive cutpoints and to assess population frequencies of the different preclinical AD stages using different cutpoint criteria. RESULTS: The new criteria subdivide the preclinical phase of AD into stages 1 to 3. To classify our CN subjects, 2 additional categories were needed. Stage 0 denotes subjects with normal AD biomarkers and no evidence of subtle cognitive impairment. Suspected non-AD pathophysiology (SNAP) denotes subjects with normal amyloid PET imaging, but abnormal neurodegeneration biomarker studies. At fixed cutpoints corresponding to 90% sensitivity for diagnosing AD and the 10th percentile of CN cognitive scores, 43% of our sample was classified as stage 0, 16% stage 1, 12 % stage 2, 3% stage 3, and 23% SNAP. INTERPRETATION: This cross-sectional evaluation of the NIA-AA criteria for preclinical AD indicates that the 1-3 staging criteria coupled with stage 0 and SNAP categories classify 97% of CN subjects from a population-based sample, leaving only 3% unclassified. Future longitudinal validation of the criteria will be important.

22488727|t|Proteomic study of amyloid beta (25-35) peptide exposure to neuronal cells: Impact on APE1/Ref-1's protein-protein interaction.
22488727|a|The genotoxic, extracellular accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) protein and subsequent neuronal cell death are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). APE1/Ref-1, the predominant apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease and essential in eukaryotic cells, plays a central role in the base excision repair (BER) pathway for repairing oxidized and alkylated bases and single-strand breaks (SSBs) in DNA. APE1/Ref-1 is also involved in the redox activation of several trans-acting factors (TFs) in various cell types, but little is known about its role in neuronal functions. There is emerging evidence for APE1/Ref-1's role in neuronal cells vulnerable in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders, as reflected in its nuclear accumulation in AD brains. An increase in APE1/Ref-1 has been shown to enhance neuronal survival after oxidative stress. To address whether APE1/Ref-1 level or its association with other proteins is responsible for this protective effect, we used 2-D proteomic analyses and identified cytoskeleton elements (i.e., tropomodulin 3, tropomyosin alpha-3 chain), enzymes involved in energy metabolism (i.e., pyruvate kinase M2, N-acetyl transferase, sulfotransferase 1c), proteins involved in stress response (i.e., leucine-rich and death domain, anti-NGF30), and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotien-H (hnRNP-H) as being associated with APE1/Ref-1 in Abeta(25-35)-treated rat pheochromocytoma PC12 and human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell lines, two common neuronal precursor lines used in Abeta neurotoxicity studies. Because the levels of some of these proteins are affected in the brains of AD patients, our study suggests a neuroprotective role for APE1/Ref-1 via its association with those proteins and modulating their cellular functions during Abeta-mediated neurotoxicity.

22488900|t|Modification of gamma-secretase by nitrosative stress links neuronal ageing to sporadic Alzheimer's disease.
22488900|a|Inherited familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by small increases in the ratio of Abeta42 versus Abeta40 peptide which is thought to drive the amyloid plaque formation in the brain of these patients. Little is known however whether ageing, the major risk factor for sporadic AD, affects amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) generation as well. Here we demonstrate that the secretion of Abeta is enhanced in an in vitro model of neuronal ageing, correlating with an increase in gamma-secretase complex formation. Moreover we found that peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)), produced by the reaction of superoxide anion with nitric oxide, promoted the nitrotyrosination of presenilin 1 (PS1), the catalytic subunit of gamma-secretase. This was associated with an increased association of the two PS1 fragments, PS1-CTF and PS1-NTF, which constitute the active catalytic centre. Furthermore, we found that peroxynitrite shifted the production of Abeta towards Abeta(42) and increased the Abeta(42) /Abeta(40) ratio. Our work identifies nitrosative stress as a potential mechanistic link between ageing and AD.

22489572|t|Anti-Streptococcus mutans efficacy of Thai herbal formula used as a remedy for dental caries.
22489572|a|CONTEXT: Traditional knowledge of herbal remedies plays an important role in the search for more effective alternative treatment of a variety of disorders. The ethnobotanical surveys in southern Thailand have revealed that 35 Thai herbal formulas have been used by Thai traditional healers against dental caries. However, the scientific evaluation to confirm their rational uses is scarce. OBJECTIVE: To test in vitro anti-Streptococcus mutans activity of Thai herbal formulas used against dental caries (THF-DC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ethanol extracts of Thai herbal formulas were evaluated for antibacterial activity against S. mutans. Agar disc diffusion was employed as a preliminary screening assay, followed by broth microdilution assay to assess minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Furthermore, medicinal plants contained in the most active THF-DC were investigated for their phytochemicals. RESULTS: Eleven THF-DC extracts exhibited clear inhibition zones of 7.0-22.5 mm against S. mutans. Subsequent determination of their MIC revealed that the formula containing Albizia myriophylla Benth. (Leguminosae), Alpinia galanga (L.) Willd. (Zingiberaceae), Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh. (Acanthaceae), and Ocimum sanctum L. (Lamiaceae) was the most active, with MIC at 250 microg/mL. Among these medicinal plants, A. myriophylla gave the strongest activity with MIC at 3.9 microg/mL, followed by A. marina with MIC at 62.5 microg/mL. Various classes of bioactive phytochemicals including tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids, and terpenoids were found in these extracts. CONCLUSION: Anti-S. mutans activity of THF-DC extracts was established. Further investigations may be required for the isolation and chemical characterization of the active ingredients in A. myriophylla.

22489600|t|Effects of membrane lipids on the activity and processivity of purified gamma-secretase.
22489600|a|The 19-transmembrane multisubunit gamma-secretase complex generates the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by intramembrane proteolysis of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP). Despite substantial advances in elucidating how this protein complex functions, the effect of the local membrane lipid microenvironment on gamma-secretase cleavage of substrates is still poorly understood. Using detergent-free proteoliposomes to reconstitute purified human gamma-secretase, we examined the effects of fatty acyl (FA) chain length, saturation and double-bond isomerization, and membrane lipid polar headgroups on gamma-secretase function. We analyzed gamma-secretase activity and processivity [i.e., sequential cleavages in the APP transmembrane domain that convert longer Abeta species (e.g., Abeta(46)) into shorter ones (e.g., Abeta(40))] by quantifying the APP intracellular domain (AICD) and various Abeta peptides, including via a bicine/urea gel system that detects multiple Abeta lengths. These assays revealed several trends. (1) Switching from a cis to a trans isomer of a monounsaturated FA chain in phosphatidylcholine (PC) increased gamma-activity, did not affect Abeta(42):Abeta(40) ratios, but decreased the ratio of long (>=42) versus short (<=41) Abeta peptides. (2) Increasing the FA carbon chain length (14, 16, 18, and 20) increased gamma-activity, reduced longer Abeta species, and reduced the Abeta(42):Abeta(40) ratio. (3) Shifting the position of the double bond in 18:1(Delta9-cis) PC to the Delta6 position substantially reduced activity. (4) Gangliosides increased gamma-activity but decreased processivity, thus elevating the Abeta(42):Abeta(40) ratio. (5) Phosphatidylserine decreased gamma-activity but increased processivity. (6) Phosphatidylinositol strongly inhibited gamma-activity. Overall, our results show that subtle changes in membrane lipid composition can greatly influence gamma-secretase activity and processivity, suggesting that relatively small changes in lipid membrane composition may affect the risk of AD at least as much as presenilin or APP mutations do.

22489897|t|Discovery of novel potent and highly selective glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) inhibitors for Alzheimer's disease: design, synthesis, and characterization of pyrazines.
22489897|a|Glycogen synthase kinase-3beta, also called tau phosphorylating kinase, is a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase which was originally identified due to its role in glycogen metabolism. Active forms of GSK3beta localize to pretangle pathology including dystrophic neuritis and neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. By using a high throughput screening (HTS) approach to search for new chemical series and cocrystallization of key analogues to guide the optimization and synthesis of our pyrazine series, we have developed highly potent and selective inhibitors showing cellular efficacy and blood-brain barrier penetrance. The inhibitors are suitable for in vivo efficacy testing and may serve as a new treatment strategy for Alzheimer's disease.

22490781|t|Identification of a novel amyloid precursor protein processing pathway that generates secreted N-terminal fragments.
22490781|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system. The proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) into the beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide is a central event in AD. While the pathway that generates Abeta is well described, many questions remain concerning general APP metabolism and its metabolites. It is becoming clear that the amino-terminal region of APP can be processed to release small N-terminal fragments (NTFs). The purpose of this study was to investigate the occurrence and generation of APP NTFs in vivo and in cell culture (SH-SY5Y) in order to delineate the cellular pathways implicated in their generation. We were able to detect 17- to 28-kDa APP NTFs in human and mouse brain tissue that are distinct from N-APP fragments previously reported. We show that the 17- to 28-kDa APP NTFs were highly expressed in mice from the age of 2 wk to adulthood. SH-SY5Y studies indicate the generation of APP NTFs involves a novel APP processing pathway, regulated by protein kinase C, but independent of alpha-secretase or beta-secretase 1 (BACE) activity. These results identify a novel, developmentally regulated APP processing pathway that may play an important role in the physiological function of APP.

22491325|t|Soluble amyloid precursor protein-alpha modulates beta-secretase activity and amyloid-beta generation.
22491325|a|In sporadic age-related forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD), it is unclear why amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides accumulate. Here we show that soluble amyloid precursor protein-alpha (sAPP-alpha) decreases Abeta generation by directly associating with beta-site APP-converting enzyme (BACE)1, thereby modulating APP processing. Whereas specifically targeting sAPP-alpha using antibodies enhances Abeta production; in transgenic mice with AD-like pathology, sAPP-alpha overexpression decreases beta-amyloid plaques and soluble Abeta. In support, immunoneutralization of sAPP-alpha increases APP amyloidogenic processing in these mice. Given our current findings, and because a number of risk factors for sporadic AD serve to lower levels of sAPP-alpha in brains of AD patients, inadequate sAPP-alpha levels may be sufficient to polarize APP processing towards the amyloidogenic, Abeta-producing route. Therefore, restoration of sAPP-alpha or enhancement of its association with BACE may be viable strategies to ameliorate imbalances in APP processing that can lead to AD pathogenesis.

22491675|t|(E)-5-styryl-1H-indole and (E)-6-styrylquinoline derivatives serve as probes for beta-amyloid plaques.
22491675|a|We report the synthesis and biological evaluation of novel (E)-5-styryl-1H-indole and (E)-6-styrylquinoline derivatives as probes for imaging beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques. These derivatives showed binding affinities for Abeta1-40 aggregates with K(i) values varying from 4.1 to 288.4 nM. (E)-5-(4-iodostyryl)-1H-indole (8) clearly stained Abeta plaques in the brain sections of Alzheimer's disease (AD) model mice (APP/PS1). Furthermore, autoradiography for [125I]8 displayed intense and specific labeling of Abeta plaques in the brain sections mentioned above with low background. In biodistribution experiments using normal mice [125I]8 showed high initial brain uptake followed by rapid washout (4.27 and 0.64% ID/g at 2 and 30 min post injection, respectively). These findings suggests that [123I]8 may be a potential SPECT imaging agent for detecting Abeta plaques in AD brain.

22491780|t|The prognostic value of amyloid imaging.
22491780|a|Mild cognitive impairment is characterized by a decline in cognitive performance without interference with activities of daily living. The amnestic subtype of mild cognitive impairment progresses to Alzheimer's disease at a rate of 10-15% per year and in the majority the neuropathology is intermediate between the neuropathological changes of typical ageing and Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid deposition occurs over a decade before the development of noticeable cognitive symptoms in a continuous process that starts in healthy elderly individuals. Newly developed PET amyloid imaging agents provide noninvasive biomarkers for the early in vivo detection of Alzheimer's pathology in healthy elderly individuals and those with mild cognitive impairment. Exclusion of amyloid pathology should allow a more accurate prognosis to be given and ensure appropriate recruitment into clinical trials testing the efficacy of new putative antiamyloid agents at an earlier disease stage. The development of (18)F-labelled amyloid imaging agents has increased the availability of this new technology for clinical and research use since they can be used in PET centres where a cyclotron and radiochemistry are not available. This review discusses the role of PET imaging for assessing the amyloid load in cognitively normal elderly subjects and subjects with mild cognitive impairment at risk of conversion to Alzheimer's disease.

22491860|t|Role of common and rare APP DNA sequence variants in Alzheimer disease.
22491860|a|OBJECTIVES: More than 30 different rare mutations, including copy number variants (CNVs), in the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP) cause early-onset familial Alzheimer disease (EOFAD), whereas the contribution of common APP variants to disease risk remains controversial. In this study we systematically assessed the role of both rare and common APP DNA variants in Alzheimer disease (AD) families. METHODS: Families with EOFAD genetically linked to the APP region were screened for missense mutations and locus duplications of APP. Further, using genome-wide DNA microarray data, we examined the APP locus for CNVs in a total of 797 additional early- and late-onset AD pedigrees. Finally, 423 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the APP locus, including 2 promoter polymorphisms previously associated with AD risk, were tested in up to 4,200 individuals from multiplex AD families. RESULTS: Analyses of 8 21q21-linked families revealed one family carrying a nonsynonymous mutation in exon 17 (Val717Leu) and another family with a partially penetrant 3.5-Mb locus duplication encompassing APP. CNV analysis in the APP locus revealed an additional family carrying a fully penetrant 380-kb duplication, merely spanning APP. Last, contrary to previous reports, association analyses of more than 400 different SNPs in or near APP failed to show significant effects on AD risk. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that APP mutations and locus duplications are a very rare cause of EOFAD and that the contribution of common APP variants to AD susceptibility is insignificant. Furthermore, duplications of APP may not be fully penetrant, possibly indicating the existence of hitherto unknown protective genetic factors.

22492027|t|Age-dependent rescue by simvastatin of Alzheimer's disease cerebrovascular and memory deficits.
22492027|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is now established as a progressive compromise not only of the neurons but also of the cerebral vasculature. Increasing evidence also indicates that cerebrovascular dysfunction may be a key or an aggravating pathogenic factor in AD, emphasizing the importance to properly control this deficit when aiming for effective therapy. Here, we report that simvastatin (3-6 months, 40 mg/kg/d) completely rescued cerebrovascular reactivity, basal endothelial nitric oxide synthesis, and activity-induced neurometabolic and neurovascular coupling in adult (6 months) and aged (12 months) transgenic mice overexpressing the Swedish and Indiana mutations of the human amyloid precursor protein (AD mice). Remarkably, simvastatin fully restored short- and long-term memory in adult, but not in aged AD mice. These beneficial effects occurred without any decreasing effect of simvastatin on brain amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels or plaque load. However, in AD mice with recovered memory, protein levels of the learning- and memory-related immediate early genes c-Fos and Egr-1 were normalized or upregulated in hippocampal CA1 neurons, indicative of restored neuronal function. In contrast, the levels of phospholipase A2, enkephalin, PSD-95, synaptophysin, or glutamate NMDA receptor subunit type 2B were either unaltered in AD mice or unaffected by treatment. These findings disclose new sites of action for statins against Abeta-induced neuronal and cerebrovascular deficits that could be predictive of therapeutic benefit in AD patients. They further indicate that simvastatin and, possibly, other brain penetrant statins bear high therapeutic promise in early AD and in patients with vascular diseases who are at risk of developing AD.

22492035|t|Reducing human apolipoprotein E levels attenuates age-dependent Abeta accumulation in mutant human amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice.
22492035|a|Apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4) plays a major role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Brain amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation depends on age and apoE isoforms (apoE4 > apoE3) both in humans and in transgenic mouse models. Brain apoE levels are also isoform dependent, but in the opposite direction (apoE4 < apoE3). Thus, one prevailing hypothesis is to increase brain apoE expression to reduce Abeta levels. To test this hypothesis, we generated mutant human amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice expressing one or two copies of the human APOE3 or APOE4 gene that was knocked in and flanked by LoxP sites. We report that reducing apoE3 or apoE4 expression by 50% in 6-month-old mice results in efficient Abeta clearance and does not increase Abeta accumulation. However, 12-month-old mice with one copy of the human APOE gene had significantly reduced Abeta levels and plaque loads compared with mice with two copies, regardless of which human apoE isoform was expressed, suggesting a gene dose-dependent effect of apoE on Abeta accumulation in aged mice. Additionally, 12-month-old mice expressing one or two copies of the human APOE4 gene had significantly higher levels of Abeta accumulation and plaque loads than age-matched mice expressing one or two copies of the human APOE3 gene, suggesting an isoform-dependent effect of apoE on Abeta accumulation in aged mice. Moreover, Cre-mediated APOE4 gene excision in hippocampal astrocytes significantly reduced insoluble Abeta in adult mice. Thus, reducing, rather than increasing, apoE expression is an attractive approach to lowering brain Abeta levels.

22492514|t|Subacute ischemic stroke is associated with focal 11C PiB positron emission tomography retention but not with global neocortical Abeta deposition.
22492514|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Conflicting evidence exists as to whether focal cerebral ischemia contributes to cerebral amyloid deposition. We aimed to look at Abeta deposits, detected by N-methyl-2-(4'-methylaminophenyl)-6-hydroxybenzothiazole (PiB) positron emission tomography, in patients with recent ischemic stroke. Specifically, we hypothesized that patients with recent ischemic stroke have higher local and neocortical PiB positron emission tomography retention and that this may be associated with major vascular risk factors. METHODS: Ischemic stroke patients were studied using PiB positron emission tomography within 30 days and compared to age-matched controls. Distribution volume ratio maps were created using Logan graphical analysis with the cerebellar cortex as a reference. RESULTS: Among the 21 ischemic stroke patients (median age, 76 years; interquartile range, 68-77), the ipsilateral peri-infarct region PiB retention was higher compared to the contralateral mirror region, with a PiB distribution volume ratio difference of 0.29 (95% CI, 0.2-0.44; P=0.001) at median 10 (interquartile range, 7-14) days after stroke. Two patients also had higher PiB retention within the infarct compared to the contralateral side. There was no difference in the neocortical PiB retention elsewhere in the brain among ischemic stroke patients compared with 22 age-matched normal controls (P=0.22). Among the risk factors in the ischemic stroke patients, diabetes was associated with a higher neocortical PiB retention (Spearman Rho=0.48; 95% CI, 0.28-0.72). CONCLUSIONS: PiB retention was higher in the peri-infarct region among patients with recent ischemic stroke. This did not translate into a higher global neocortical PiB retention except possibly in patients with diabetes. The cause of the focal PiB retention is uncertain and requires further investigation.

22492996|t|Mitochondria-targeted catalase reduces abnormal APP processing, amyloid beta production and BACE1 in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease: implications for neuroprotection and lifespan extension.
22492996|a|The purpose of this study was to investigate the protective effects of the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant catalase (MCAT) and lifespan extension in mice that express amyloid beta (Abeta). Using immunoblotting and immunostaining analyses, we measured the production of full-length amyloid precursor protein (APP), soluble APPalpha, C-terminal fragments CTF99 and CTF83, monomeric and oligomeric Abeta, Abeta deposits and beta site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), in different stages of disease progression in MCAT/AbetaPP and AbetaPP mice. Using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunostaining analyses, we studied the expression of catalase, BACE1, the Alzheimer's disease (AD) markers, synaptophysin, APP, neprilysin, insulin-degrading enzyme and transthyretin in MCAT, AbetaPP, MCAT/AbetaPP and wild-type (WT) mice. Using the high pressure liquid chromatography analysis of 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine, we measured oxidative DNA damage in the cerebral cortical tissues from MCAT, AbetaPP, MCAT/AbetaPP and WT mice. We found that the AbetaPP transgenic mice that carried the human MCAT gene lived 5 months longer than did the AbetaPP mice. We also found that the overexpression of MCAT in the brain sections from the MCAT/AbetaPP transgenic mice significantly correlated with a reduction in the levels of full-length APP, CTF99, BACE1, Abeta levels (40 and 42), Abeta deposits and oxidative DNA damage relative to the brain sections from the AbetaPP mice. Interestingly, we found significantly increased levels of soluble APPalpha and CTF83 in the MCAT/AbetaPP mice, relative to the AbetaPP mice. These data provide direct evidence that oxidative stress plays a primary role in AD etiopathology and that in MCAT mice express Abeta, MCAT prevents abnormal APP processing, reduces Abeta levels and enhances Abeta-degrading enzymes in mice at different ages, corresponding to different stages of disease progression. These findings indicate that mitochondria-targeted molecules may be an effective therapeutic approach to treat patients with AD.

22494053|t|Intravenous immunoglobulin protects neurons against amyloid beta-peptide toxicity and ischemic stroke by attenuating multiple cell death pathways.
22494053|a|Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) preparations obtained by fractionating blood plasma, are increasingly being used increasingly as an effective therapeutic agent in treatment of several inflammatory diseases. Its use as a potential therapeutic agent for treatment of stroke and Alzheimer's disease has been proposed, but little is known about the neuroprotective mechanisms of IVIg. In this study, we investigated the effect of IVIg on downstream signaling pathways that are involved in neuronal cell death in experimental models of stroke and Alzheimer's disease. Treatment of cultured neurons with IVIg reduced simulated ischemia- and amyloid betapeptide (Abeta)-induced caspase 3 cleavage, and phosphorylation of the cell death-associated kinases p38MAPK, c-Jun NH2 -terminal kinase and p65, in vitro. Additionally, Abeta-induced accumulation of the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal was attenuated in neurons treated with IVIg. IVIg treatment also up-regulated the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl2 in cortical neurons under ischemia-like conditions and exposure to Abeta. Treatment of mice with IVIg reduced neuronal cell loss, apoptosis and infarct size, and improved functional outcome in a model of focal ischemic stroke. Together, these results indicate that IVIg acts directly on neurons to protect them against ischemic stroke and Abeta-induced neuronal apoptosis by inhibiting cell death pathways and by elevating levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2.

22495344|t|Platelet tau pattern correlates with cognitive status in Alzheimer's disease.
22495344|a|Platelets are major reservoirs of circulating amyloid-beta and amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) and have been postulated as a reliable source for biological markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have recently demonstrated that tau is also present in platelets, and that there are differences in the electrophoretic patterns of platelet tau forms in AD subjects with respect to controls. Here, we demonstrate that modifications in platelet tau forms occur independently of age in a broad population of 104 neurologically healthy individuals. More interesting, a strong correlation of platelet markers with the degree of cognitive impairment was evidenced in a group of 47 AD patients in comparison with 19 cognitive healthy subjects. In our series, platelet tau forms ratio had a sensitivity of 75.7% and specificity of 73.7%, respectively. We also found that platelet tau displays a significantly higher correlation with the presence of AD than the analyses of platelet AbetaPP.

22495345|t|Risk of Alzheimer's disease biological misdiagnosis linked to cerebrospinal collection tubes.
22495345|a|Tau proteins and amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides are the current recognized cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers used as an aid in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, there is no consensus on their clinical use due to non-qualified cut-off values, probably related to the observed high pre-analytical and analytical variability. Standardized pre-analytical protocols have therefore been proposed. Importantly, these recommend the use of polypropylene collection/sampling tubes while, to date, no broad comparison of these types of tubes has been conducted. In this study, we first compared, as part of a real clinical workflow, the impact of four different collection tubes on the CSF concentration of Abeta peptides (Abeta42, Abeta40) and total (hTau) and phosphorylated (P-Tau181P) tau proteins measured using routine ELISA kits. We then extended this study to 11 polypropylene tubes used by different clinical laboratories, and investigated their plastic polymer composition using differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier Transformed Infrared spectroscopy. Significant concentration variations linked solely to the use of different types of tubes were observed. This was particularly marked for Abeta peptides, with >50% disparity occurring in less than five minutes. Polymer composition analysis revealed that most polypropylene tubes were in fact copolymers with at least polyethylene. There was no clear correlation between tube composition and pre-analytical behavior. Our results show that the use of polypropylene tubes does not guarantee satisfactory pre-analytical behavior. They also point to collection/sampling tubes being a major pre-analytical source of variability that could impact the significance of AD biological diagnosis.

22496568|t|Lysosomal dysfunction in a mouse model of Sandhoff disease leads to accumulation of ganglioside-bound amyloid-beta peptide.
22496568|a|Alterations in the lipid composition of endosomal-lysosomal membranes may constitute an early event in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. In this study, we investigated the possibility that GM2 ganglioside accumulation in a mouse model of Sandhoff disease might be associated with the accumulation of intraneuronal and extracellular proteins commonly observed in AD. Our results show intraneuronal accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta)-like, alpha-synuclein-like, and phospho-tau-like immunoreactivity in the brains of beta-hexosaminidase knock-out (HEXB KO) mice. Biochemical and immunohistochemical analyses confirmed that at least some of the intraneuronal Abeta-like immunoreactivity (iAbeta-LIR) represents amyloid precursor protein C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) and/or Abeta. In addition, we observed increased levels of Abeta40 and Abeta42 peptides in the lipid-associated fraction of HEXB KO mouse brains, and intraneuronal accumulation of ganglioside-bound Abeta (GAbeta) immunoreactivity in a brain region-specific manner. Furthermore, alpha-synuclein and APP-CTFs and/or Abeta were found to accumulate in different regions of the substantia nigra, indicating different mechanisms of accumulation or turnover pathways. Based on the localization of the accumulated iAbeta-LIR to endosomes, lysosomes, and autophagosomes, we conclude that a significant accumulation of iAbeta-LIR may be associated with the lysosomal-autophagic turnover of Abeta and fragments of APP-containing Abeta epitopes. Importantly, intraneuronal GAbeta immunoreactivity, a proposed prefibrillar aggregate found in AD, was found to accumulate throughout the frontal cortices of postmortem human GM1 gangliosidosis, Sandhoff disease, and Tay-Sachs disease brains. Together, these results establish an association between the accumulation of gangliosides, autophagic vacuoles, and the intraneuronal accumulation of proteins associated with AD.

22496575|t|Distinct dendritic spine and nuclear phases of calcineurin activation after exposure to amyloid-beta revealed by a novel fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay.
22496575|a|Calcineurin (CaN) activation is critically involved in the regulation of spine morphology in response to oligomeric amyloid-beta (Abeta) as well as in synaptic plasticity in normal memory, but no existing techniques can monitor the spatiotemporal pattern of CaN activity. Here, we use a spectral fluorescence resonance energy transfer approach to monitor CaN activation dynamics in real time with subcellular resolution. When oligomeric Abeta derived from Tg2576 murine transgenic neurons or human AD brains were applied to wild-type murine primary cortical neurons, we observe a dynamic progression of CaN activation within minutes, first in dendritic spines, and then in the cytoplasm and, in hours, in the nucleus. CaN activation in spines leads to rapid but reversible morphological changes in spines and in postsynaptic proteins; longer exposure leads to NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells) translocation to the nucleus and frank spine loss. These results provide a framework for understanding the role of calcineurin in synaptic alterations associated with AD pathogenesis.

22498096|t|Active Abeta vaccination fails to enhance amyloid clearance in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease with Abeta42-driven pathology.
22498096|a|Abeta vaccination has been shown to induce remarkable clearance of brain amyloid plaques in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the extent to which antibody-mediated Abeta clearance is affected by predominant formation of Abeta42 over Abeta40 is unclear. Here we demonstrate for the first time that in a mouse model carrying the human APP mutations KM670/671NL and the human PS1 mutation P166L, Abeta vaccination does not result in plaque clearance. This was in spite of the strong T- and B-cell immune responses evoked under the DR1501 genetic background and the activation of microglia at sites of Abeta plaques. Our findings suggest the existence of antibody-resistant forms of Abeta deposits in the brain consisting of primarily Abeta42, and shed light on the mechanisms of antibody-dependent amyloid clearance as well as novel therapeutic strategies for AD.

22498308|t|The protective effects of tanshinone IIA on beta-amyloid protein (1-42)-induced cytotoxicity via activation of the Bcl-xL pathway in neuron.
22498308|a|The deposition of beta-amyloid protein(Abeta) and loss of neurons within the brain are the pathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Apoptosis is a crucial pathway in neuronal loss in AD. Tanshinone IIA (tanIIA) is one of ingredients of tanshinone which is the major component of the traditional Chinese herb Danshen. The present study explores the effects of tanIIA on Abeta(1-42)-induced cytotoxicity. Cultured cortical neurons that were treated with 4 muM Abeta(1-42) showed shrunken perikaryon with loss of neurite processes; the survival rate of neurons decreased almost to 57% and the apoptotic rate of neurons increased to 47%. In addition, the level of gene bcl-xl mRNA and Bcl-xL protein decreased significantly. These changes, however, were prevented by pretreatment of neurons with tanIIA for 24h before Abeta(1-42), which markedly increased neuron survival rate compared to neurons treated with Abeta(1-42) alone; the apoptotic rate of neurons decreased to 15%, and the decrease in level of gene bcl-xl mRNA and Bcl-xL protein in Abeta-treated neurons, were prevented. Thus, we conclude that tanIIA might serve as an obvious neuroprotection. TanIIA protected neurons against the Abeta-induced cytotoxicity most likely via activation of the Bcl-xL pathway.

22500019|t|Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide directly activates amylin-3 receptor subtype by triggering multiple intracellular signaling pathways.
22500019|a|The two age-prevalent diseases Alzheimer disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus share many common features including the deposition of amyloidogenic proteins, amyloid beta protein (Abeta) and amylin (islet amyloid polypeptide), respectively. Recent evidence suggests that both Abeta and amylin may express their effects through the amylin receptor, although the precise mechanisms for this interaction at a cellular level are unknown. Here, we studied this by generating HEK293 cells with stable expression of an isoform of the amylin receptor family, amylin receptor-3 (AMY3). Abeta1-42 and human amylin (hAmylin) increase cytosolic cAMP and Ca(2+), trigger multiple pathways involving the signal transduction mediators protein kinase A, MAPK, Akt, and cFos. Abeta1-42 and hAmylin also induce cell death during exposure for 24-48 h at low micromolar concentrations. In the presence of hAmylin, Abeta1-42 effects on HEK293-AMY3-expressing cells are occluded, suggesting a shared mechanism of action between the two peptides. Amylin receptor antagonist AC253 blocks increases in intracellular Ca(2+), activation of protein kinase A, MAPK, Akt, cFos, and cell death, which occur upon AMY3 activation with hAmylin, Abeta1-42, or their co-application. Our data suggest that AMY3 plays an important role by serving as a receptor target for actions Abeta and thus may represent a novel therapeutic target for development of compounds to treat neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer disease.

22502547|t|Exploring the inter-molecular interactions in amyloid-beta protofibril with molecular dynamics simulations and molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area free energy calculations.
22502547|a|Aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides correlates with the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. However, the inter-molecular interactions between Abeta protofibril remain elusive. Herein, molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area analysis based on all-atom molecular dynamics simulations was performed to study the inter-molecular interactions in Abeta(17-42) protofibril. It is found that the nonpolar interactions are the important forces to stabilize the Abeta(17-42) protofibril, while electrostatic interactions play a minor role. Through free energy decomposition, 18 residues of the Abeta(17-42) are identified to provide interaction energy lower than -2.5 kcal/mol. The nonpolar interactions are mainly provided by the main chain of the peptide and the side chains of nine hydrophobic residues (Leu17, Phe19, Phe20, Leu32, Leu34, Met35, Val36, Val40, and Ile41). However, the electrostatic interactions are mainly supplied by the main chains of six hydrophobic residues (Phe19, Phe20, Val24, Met35, Val36, and Val40) and the side chains of the charged residues (Glu22, Asp23, and Lys28). In the electrostatic interactions, the overwhelming majority of hydrogen bonds involve the main chains of Abeta as well as the guanidinium group of the charged side chain of Lys28. The work has thus elucidated the molecular mechanism of the inter-molecular interactions between Abeta monomers in Abeta(17-42) protofibril, and the findings are considered critical for exploring effective agents for the inhibition of Abeta aggregation.

22502908|t|Human recombinant beta-secretase immobilized enzyme reactor for fast hits' selection and characterization from a virtual screening library.
22502908|a|In the present work, a human recombinant BACE1 immobilized enzyme reactor (hrBACE1-IMER) has been applied for the sensitive fast screening of 38 compounds selected through a virtual screening approach. HrBACE1-IMER was inserted into a liquid chromatograph coupled with a fluorescent detector. A fluorogenic peptide substrate (M-2420), containing the beta-secretase site of the Swedish mutation of APP, was injected and cleaved in the on-line HPLC-hrBACE1-IMER system, giving rise to the fluorescent product. The compounds of the library were tested for their ability to inhibit BACE1 in the immobilized format and to reduce the area related to the chromatographic peak of the fluorescent enzymatic product. The results were validated in solution by using two different FRET methods. Due to the efficient virtual screening methodology, more than fifty percent of the selected compounds showed a measurable inhibitory activity. One of the most active compound (a bis-indanone derivative) was characterized in terms of IC(50) and K(i) determination on the hrBACE1-IMER. Thus, the hrBACE1-IMER has been confirmed as a valid tool for the throughput screening of different chemical entities with potency lower than 30muM for the fast hits' selection and for mode of action determination.

22503002|t|O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase inhibitor attenuates beta-amyloid plaque and rescues memory impairment.
22503002|a|Deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) as senile plaques and disrupted glucose metabolism are two main characteristics of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is unknown, however, how these two processes are related in AD. Here we examined the relationship between O-GlcNAcylation, which is a glucose level-dependent post-translational modification that adds O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) to proteins, and Abeta production in a mouse model of AD carrying 5XFAD genes. We found that 1,2-dideoxy-2'-propyl-alpha-d-glucopyranoso-[2,1-D]-Delta2'-thiazoline (NButGT), a specific inhibitor of O-GlcNAcase, reduces Abeta production by lowering gamma-secretase activity both in vitro and in vivo. We also found that O-GlcNAcylation takes place at the S708 residue of nicastrin, which is a component of gamma-secretase. Moreover, NButGT attenuated the accumulation of Abeta, neuroinflammation, and memory impairment in the 5XFAD mice. This is the first study to show the relationship between Abeta generation and O-GlcNAcylation in vivo. These results suggest that O-GlcNAcylation may be a suitable therapeutic target for the treatment of AD.

22503160|t|Estimating sample sizes for predementia Alzheimer's trials based on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.
22503160|a|This study modeled predementia Alzheimer's disease clinical trials. Longitudinal data from cognitively normal (CN) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were used to calculate sample size requirements for trials using outcome measures, including the Clinical Dementia Rating scale sum of boxes, Mini-Mental State Examination, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale with and without delayed recall, and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Task. We examined the impact on sample sizes of enrichment for genetic and biomarker criteria, including cerebrospinal fluid protein and neuroimaging analyses. We observed little cognitive decline in the CN population at 36 months, regardless of the enrichment strategy. Nonetheless, in CN subjects, using Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Task total as an outcome at 36 months required the fewest subjects across enrichment strategies, with apolipoprotein E genotype epsilon4 carrier status requiring the fewest (n = 499 per arm to demonstrate a 25% reduction in disease progression). In MCI, enrichment reduced the required sample sizes for trials, relative to estimates based on all subjects. For MCI, the Clinical Dementia Rating scale sum of boxes consistently required the smallest sample sizes. We conclude that predementia clinical trial conduct in Alzheimer's disease is enhanced by the use of biomarker inclusion criteria.

22503458|t|In vitro characterization of [18F]-florbetaben, an Abeta imaging radiotracer.
22503458|a|PURPOSE: Amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques are a major pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The noninvasive detection of Abeta plaques may increase the accuracy of clinical diagnosis as well as monitor therapeutic interventions. While [(11)C]-PiB is the most widely used Abeta positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer, due to the short half-life of (11)C (20 min), its application is limited to centers with an on-site cyclotron and (11)C radiochemistry expertise. Therefore, novel [(18)F] (half-life 110 min)-labeled Abeta PET tracers have been developed. We have demonstrated that [(18)F]-florbetaben-PET can differentiate individuals diagnosed with AD from healthy elderly, Parkinson's disease and frontotemporal lobe dementia (FTLD-tau) patients. While [(18)F]-florbetaben-PET retention matched the reported postmortem distribution of Abeta plaques, the nature of [(18)F]-florbetaben binding to other pathological lesions comprising misfolded proteins needs further assessment. The objective of this study was to determine whether Florbetaben selectively binds to Abeta plaques in postmortem tissue specimens containing mixed pathological hallmarks (i.e., tau and alpha-synuclein aggregates). METHOD: Human AD, FTLD-tau and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) brain sections were analyzed by [(18)F]-florbetaben autoradiography and [(3)H]-florbetaben high-resolution emulsion autoradiography and [(19)F]-florbetaben fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: Both autoradiographical analyses demonstrated that Florbetaben exclusively bound Abeta plaques in AD brain sections at low nanomolar concentrations. Furthermore, at concentrations thousand-folds higher than those during a PET scan, [(19)F]-florbetaben did not bind to alpha-synuclein or tau aggregates in DLB and FTLD-tau brain sections, respectively. Detection of [(19)F]-florbetaben staining by fluorescence microscopy in several AD brain regions demonstrated that Florbetaben identified Abeta plaques in all brain regions examined. CONCLUSION: This study provides further evidence that [(18)F]-florbetaben-PET is a highly selective radiotracer to assess Abeta plaque deposition in the brain.

22503775|t|Biomarkers of dementia: comparison of electrochemiluminescence results and reference ranges with conventional ELISA.
22503775|a|We compared the performance of the Meso Scale Diagnostics electrochemiluminescence (MSD) multiplex assay for t-tau and p-tau(231), originally developed for measurement of brain cell extract and tissue cultures, with the established standard method, the Innogenetics ELISA for total and p-tau(181). The methods were also clinically evaluated with 120 samples from our mono center population. The established Innogenetics ELISA procedures have been well optimized to measure patient samples in the normal and pathological range. Compared to the MSD they were superior in the limit of detection for total as well as p-tau. The obtained reference values for our normal controls were in the upper third of the published studies. Innogenetics tau, Innogenetics p-tau(181) and MSD t-tau differentiated the Alzheimer's (n=44) and minimal impairment group (MCI, n=39) from normal controls (n=37), but the MCI group was not statistically different from the normal controls. The MSD multiplex assay measured t-tau adequately but p-tau(231) could not differentiate normal from pathological results in CSF due to the high limit of detection. Both procedures however, have to be further standardized and complemented by adequate internal and external quality control schemes to qualify for routine analysis in a medical laboratory.

22503777|t|Simultaneous analysis of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers using microsphere-based xMAP multiplex technology for early detection of Alzheimer's disease.
22503777|a|The xMAP-Luminex multiplex platform for measurement of Alzheimer's disease (AD) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers using Innogenetics AlzBio3 immunoassay reagents that are for research use only has been shown to be an effective tool for early detection of an AD-like biomarker signature based on concentrations of CSF Abeta(1-42), t-tau and p-tau(181). Among the several advantages of the xMAP-Luminex platform for AD CSF biomarkers are: a wide dynamic range of ready-to-use calibrators, time savings for the simultaneous analyses of three biomarkers in one analytical run, reduction of human error, potential of reduced cost of reagents, and a modest reduction of sample volume as compared to conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) methodology. Recent clinical studies support the use of CSF Abeta(1-42), t-tau and p-tau(181) measurement using the xMAP-Luminex platform for the early detection of AD pathology in cognitively normal individuals, and for prediction of progression to AD dementia in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Studies that have shown the prediction of risk for progression to AD dementia by MCI patients provide the basis for the use of CSF Abeta(1-42), t-tau and p-tau(181) testing to assign risk for progression in patients enrolled in therapeutic trials. Furthermore emerging study data suggest that these pathologic changes occur in cognitively normal subjects 20 or more years before the onset of clinically detectable memory changes thus providing an objective measurement for use in the assessment of treatment effects in primary treatment trials. However, numerous previous ELISA and Luminex-based multiplex studies reported a wide range of absolute values of CSF Abeta(1-42), t-tau and p-tau(181) indicative of substantial inter-laboratory variability as well as varying degrees of intra-laboratory imprecision. In order to address these issues a recent inter-laboratory investigation that included a common set of CSF pool aliquots from controls as well as AD patients over a range of normal and pathological Abeta(1-42), t-tau and p-tau(181) values as well as agreed-on standard operating procedures (SOPs) assessed the reproducibility of the multiplex methodology and Innogenetics AlzBio3 immunoassay reagents. This study showed within-center precision values of 5% to a little more than 10% and good inter-laboratory %CV values (10-20%). There are several likely factors influencing the variability of CSF Abeta(1-42), t-tau and p-tau(181) measurements. In this review, we describe the pre-analytical, analytical and post-analytical sources of variability including sources inherent to kits, and describe procedures to decrease the variability. A CSF AD biomarker Quality Control program has been established and funded by the Alzheimer Association, and global efforts are underway to further define optimal pre-analytical SOPs and best practices for the methodologies available or in development including plans for production of a standard reference material that could provide for a common standard against which manufacturers of immunoassay kits would assign calibration standard values.

22504320|t|Enhanced brain amyloid-beta clearance by rifampicin and caffeine as a possible protective mechanism against Alzheimer's disease.
22504320|a|Rifampicin and caffeine are widely used drugs with reported protective effect against Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanism underlying this effect is incompletely understood. In this study, we have hypothesized that enhanced amyloid-beta (Abeta) clearance from the brain across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) of wild-type mice treated with rifampicin or caffeine is caused by both drugs potential to upregulate low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein-1 (LRP1) and/or P-glycoprotein (P-gp) at the BBB. Expression studies of LRP1 and P-gp in brain endothelial cells and isolated mice brain microvessels following treatment with rifampicin or caffeine demonstrated both drugs as P-gp inducers, and only rifampicin as an LRP1 inducer. Also, brain efflux index (BEI%) studies conducted on C57BL/6 mice treated with either drug to study alterations in Abeta clearance demonstrated the BEI% of Abeta in rifampicin (82.4 +- 4.3%) and caffeine (80.4 +- 4.8%) treated mice were significantly higher than those of control mice (62.4 +- 6.1%, p < 0.01). LRP1 and P-gp inhibition studies confirmed the importance of both proteins to the clearance of Abeta, and that enhanced clearance following drugs treatment was caused by LRP1 and/or P-gp upregulation at the mouse BBB. Furthermore, our results provided evidence for the presence of a yet to be identified transporter/receptor that plays significant role in Abeta clearance and is upregulated by caffeine and rifampicin. In conclusion, our results demonstrated the upregulation of LRP1 and P-gp at the BBB by rifampicin and caffeine enhanced brain Abeta clearance, and this effect could explain, at least in part, the protective effect of rifampicin and caffeine against AD.

22505025|t|The mechanism of gamma-Secretase dysfunction in familial Alzheimer disease.
22505025|a|The mechanisms by which mutations in the presenilins (PSEN) or the amyloid precursor protein (APP) genes cause familial Alzheimer disease (FAD) are controversial. FAD mutations increase the release of amyloid beta (Abeta)42 relative to Abeta40 by an unknown, possibly gain-of-toxic-function, mechanism. However, many PSEN mutations paradoxically impair gamma-secretase and 'loss-of-function' mechanisms have also been postulated. Here, we use kinetic studies to demonstrate that FAD mutations affect Abeta generation via three different mechanisms, resulting in qualitative changes in the Abeta profiles, which are not limited to Abeta42. Loss of e-cleavage function is not generally observed among FAD mutants. On the other hand, gamma-secretase inhibitors used in the clinic appear to block the initial e-cleavage step, but unexpectedly affect more selectively Notch than APP processing, while modulators act as activators of the carboxypeptidase-like (gamma) activity. Overall, we provide a coherent explanation for the effect of different FAD mutations, demonstrating the importance of qualitative rather than quantitative changes in the Abeta products, and suggest fundamental improvements for current drug development efforts.

22505713|t|Inhibition of choline acetyltransferase as a mechanism for cholinergic dysfunction induced by amyloid-beta peptide oligomers.
22505713|a|Dysregulated cholinergic signaling is an early hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD), usually ascribed to degeneration of cholinergic neurons induced by the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta). It is now generally accepted that neuronal dysfunction and memory deficits in the early stages of AD are caused by the neuronal impact of soluble Abeta oligomers (AbetaOs). AbetaOs build up in AD brain and specifically attach to excitatory synapses, leading to synapse dysfunction. Here, we have investigated the possibility that AbetaOs could impact cholinergic signaling. The activity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT, the enzyme that carries out ACh production) was inhibited by ~50% in cultured cholinergic neurons exposed to low nanomolar concentrations of AbetaOs. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction, lactate dehydrogenase release, and [(3)H]choline uptake assays showed no evidence of neuronal damage or loss of viability that could account for reduced ChAT activity under these conditions. Glutamate receptor antagonists fully blocked ChAT inhibition and oxidative stress induced by AbetaOs. Antioxidant polyunsaturated fatty acids had similar effects, indicating that oxidative damage may be involved in ChAT inhibition. Treatment with insulin, previously shown to down-regulate neuronal AbetaO binding sites, fully prevented AbetaO-induced inhibition of ChAT. Interestingly, we found that AbetaOs selectively bind to ~50% of cultured cholinergic neurons, suggesting that ChAT is fully inhibited in AbetaO-targeted neurons. Reduction in ChAT activity instigated by AbetaOs may thus be a relevant event in early stage AD pathology, preceding the loss of cholinergic neurons commonly observed in AD brains.

22506642|t|A mass spectrometric approach for characterization of amyloid-beta aggregates and identification of their post-translational modifications.
22506642|a|Endogenous amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomeric aggregates have been proposed as toxic agents in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Knowledge of their structures not only may provide insight into the basis of their neurotoxicities but also may reveal new targets for therapeutic drugs and diagnostic tools. However, the low levels of these Abeta oligomers have impeded structural characterization. Evidence suggests that the endogenous oligomers are covalently modified in vivo. In this report, we demonstrate an established mass spectrometry (MS) methodology called precursor ion mapping (PIM) that potentially may be applied to endogenous oligomer characterization. First, we illustrate the use of this PIM technique with a synthetic Abeta(1-40) monomer sample that had been cross-linked with transglutaminase (TGase) and digested with pepsin. From PIM analysis of an Abeta(4-13) MS/MS fragment, precursor ions were identified that corresponded to peptic fragments of three TGase cross-linked species: Abeta(4-19)--(4-19), Abeta(4-19)--(20-34), and Abeta(1-19)--(20-34). Next, we demonstrate the applicability of the PIM technique to an endogenous Abeta sample that had been purified and concentrated by immunoaffinity chromatography. Without pepsin digestion, we successfully identified the full length and C-terminally truncated monomeric Abeta species 1-35 to 1-42, along with select methionine-oxidized counterparts. Because PIM focuses only on a subpopulation of ions, namely the related precursor ions, the resulting spectra are of increased specificity and sensitivity. Therefore, this methodology shows great promise for structural analysis and identification of post-translational modification(s) in endogenous Abeta oligomers.

22508047|t|CB1 cannabinoid receptor activation rescues amyloid beta-induced alterations in behaviour and intrinsic electrophysiological properties of rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurones.
22508047|a|BACKGROUND: Amyloid beta (Abeta) is believed to be responsible for the synaptic failure that occurs in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but there is little known about the functional impact of Abeta on intrinsic neuronal properties. Here, the cellular effect of Abeta-induced neurotoxicity on the electrophysiological properties of CA1 pyramidal neurons and the mechanism(s) of neuroprotection by CB1 cannabinoid receptor activation was explored. METHODS: A combination of behavioural, molecular and electrophysiological approaches was used. RESULTS: Bilateral injections of the Abeta peptide fragment (1-42) into the prefrontal cortex caused a significant impairment in the retention and recall capability in the passive avoidance tasks and significantly increased the level of active caspase-3 in the hippocampus. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings revealed a significant reduction in the intrinsic action potential (AP) frequency and an increase in the discharge irregularity in the absence of synaptic inputs in Abeta treated group. Abeta treatment induced also significant changes in both the spontaneous and evoked neuronal responses. However, co-treatment with ACEA, a CB1 receptor agonist, preserved almost the normal intrinsic electrophysiological properties of pyramidal cells. CONCLUSIONS: In vivo Abeta treatment altered significantly the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of CA1 pyramidal neurons and the activation of CB1 cannabinoid receptors exerted a strong neuroprotective action against Abeta toxicity.

22508715|t|Reduction in inflammation and the expression of amyloid precursor protein and other proteins related to Alzheimer's disease following gastric bypass surgery.
22508715|a|OBJECTIVE: Obesity and type 2 diabetes are associated with an increase in the incidence and prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and an impaired cognitive function. Because peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNC) express amyloid precursor protein (APP), the precursor of beta-amyloid, which forms the pathognomonic plaques in the brain, we hypothesized that APP expression diminishes after the marked caloric restriction and weight loss associated with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifteen type 2 diabetic patients with morbid obesity (body mass index, 52.1 +- 13 kg/m(2)) underwent RYGB, and the expression of inflammatory and AD-related genes was examined before and after 6 months in plasma and in MNC. RESULTS: Body mass index fell to 40.4 +- 11.1 kg/m(2) at 6 months after RYGB. There was a significant fall in plasma concentrations of glucose and insulin and in homeostasis model of assessment for insulin resistance. The expression of APP mRNA fell by 31 +- 9%, and that of protein fell by 36 +- 14%. In addition, there was a reduction in the expression of other AD-related genes including presinilin-2, ADAM-9, GSK-3beta, PICALM, SORL-1, and clusterin (P < 0.05 for all). Additionally, the expression of c-Fos, a subunit of the proinflammatory transcription factor AP-1, was also suppressed after RYGB. These changes occurred in parallel with reductions in other proinflammatory mediators including C-reactive protein and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, the reversal of the proinflammatory state of obesity is associated with a concomitant reduction in the expression of APP and other AD-related genes in MNC. We conclude that obesity and caloric intake modulate the expression of APP in MNC. If indeed, this effect also occurs in the brain, this may have implications for the pathogenesis and the treatment of AD. It is relevant that cognitive function has been shown to improve with weight loss following bariatric surgery.

22510281|t|MicroRNA-153 negatively regulates the expression of amyloid precursor protein and amyloid precursor-like protein 2.
22510281|a|Increased expression of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a crucial risk factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2), a homologue of APP, is also suggested to participate in AD pathogenesis. Accumulating evidence suggest the regulatory role of microRNA on AD-related genes. Here we showed that the levels of miR-153 were significantly decreased at early- and late-stage of AD in APPswe/PSDeltaE9 murine model. Moreover, a binding site of miR-153 on APP and APLP2-3'UTR was identified, respectively, by luciferase assay. Gain and loss of function experiments demonstrated that miR-153 suppressed the expression of APP and APLP2. Using miR-153 transgenic mouse model, we testified that miR-153 downregulated the expression of APP and APLP2 protein in vivo. Furthermore, closely related expression patterns of miR-153 and APP/APLP2 during brain development indicated a physiological regulation role of miR-153 on the two genes. In a neuronal cell line treated with Abeta(42) peptides and H(2)O(2,) the levels of miR-153 varied during time-course leading to corresponding changes of APLP2 protein, indicating Abeta peptides and oxidative stress influence the expression of miR-153. Thus, miR-153 contributes to post-transcriptional regulation of APP/APLP2, suggesting a possible role for miR-153 in neuro-pathological conditions.

22510327|t|Presenilin-1 L166P mutant human pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons exhibit partial loss of gamma-secretase activity in endogenous amyloid-beta generation.
22510327|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent cause of dementia. There is compelling evidence that the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides play critical roles in AD pathogenesis. Due to limited access to human neural tissue, pathogenetic studies have, so far, mostly focused on the heterologous overexpression of mutant human APP in non-human cells. In this study, we show that key steps in proteolytic APP processing are recapitulated in neurons generated from human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural stem cells (NSC). These human NSC-derived neurons express the neuron-specific APP(695) splice variant, BACE1, and all members of the gamma-secretase complex. The human NSC-derived neurons also exhibit a differentiation-dependent increase in Abeta secretion and respond to the pharmacotherapeutic modulation by anti-amyloidogenic compounds, such as gamma-secretase inhibitors and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Being highly amenable to genetic modification, human NSCs enable the study of mechanisms caused by disease-associated mutations in human neurons. Interestingly, the AD-associated PS1(L166P) variant revealed a partial loss of gamma-secretase function, resulting in the decreased production of endogenous Abeta40 and an increased Abeta42/40 ratio. The PS1(L166P) mutant is also resistant to gamma-secretase modulation by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons thus provide experimental access to key steps in AD pathogenesis and can be used to screen pharmaceutical compounds directly in a human neuronal system.

22511769|t|Membrane-microdomain localization of amyloid beta-precursor protein (APP) C-terminal fragments is regulated by phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic Thr668 residue.
22511769|a|Amyloid beta-precursor protein (APP) is primarily cleaved by alpha- or beta-secretase to generate membrane-bound, C-terminal fragments (CTFs). In turn, CTFs are potentially subject to a second, intramembrane cleavage by gamma-secretase, which is active in a lipid raft-like membrane microdomain. Mature APP (N- and O-glycosylated APP), the actual substrate of these secretases, is phosphorylated at the cytoplasmic residue Thr(668) and this phosphorylation changes the overall conformation of the cytoplasmic domain of APP. We found that phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated CTFs exist equally in mouse brain and are kinetically equivalent as substrates for gamma-secretase, in vitro. However, in vivo, the level of the phosphorylated APP intracellular domain peptide (pAICD) generated by gamma-cleavage of CTFs was very low when compared with the level of nonphosphorylated AICD (nAICD). Phosphorylated CTFs (pCTFs), rather than nonphosphorylated CTFs (nCTFs), were preferentially located outside of detergent-resistant, lipid raft-like membrane microdomains. The APP cytoplasmic domain peptide (APP(648-695)) with Thr(P)(668) did not associate with liposomes composed of membrane lipids from mouse brain to which the nonphosphorylated peptide preferentially bound. In addition, APP lacking the C-terminal 8 amino acids (APP-DeltaC8), which are essential for membrane association, decreased Abeta generation in N2a cells. These observations suggest that the pCTFs and CTFDeltaC8 are relatively movable within the membrane, whereas the nCTFs are susceptible to being anchored into the membrane, an interaction made available as a consequence of not being phosphorylated. By this mechanism, nCTFs can be preferentially captured and cleaved by gamma-secretase. Preservation of the phosphorylated state of APP-CTFs may be a potential treatment to lower the generation of Abeta in Alzheimer disease.

22512789|t|Small-molecule BACE1 inhibitors: a patent literature review (2006 - 2011).
22512789|a|INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder for which no disease-modifying therapy exists. The amyloid hypothesis, which implicates Abeta as the toxin initiating a biological cascade leading to neurodegeneration, is the most prominent theory concerning the underlying cause of the disease. BACE1 is one of two aspartyl proteinases that generate Abeta, thus inhibition of BACE1 has the potential to ameliorate the progression of Alzheimer's disease by abating the production of Abeta. AREAS COVERED: This review chronicles small-molecule BACE1 inhibitors as described in the patent literature between 2006 and 2011 and their potential use as disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease. Over the past half a dozen years, numerous BACE1 inhibitors have been published in the patent applications, but often these contain a paltry amount of pertinent biological data (e.g. potency, selectivity, and efficacy). Fortunately, numerous relevant publications containing important data have appeared in the journal literature during this period. The goal in this effort was to create an amalgam of the two records to add value to this review. EXPERT OPINION: The pharmaceutical industry has made tremendous progress in the development of small-molecule BACE1 inhibitors that lower Abeta in the central nervous system. Assuming the amyloid hypothesis is veracious, we anticipate a disease-modifying therapy to combat Alzheimer's disease is near.

22512932|t|Measurement of apolipoprotein E and amyloid beta clearance rates in the mouse brain using bolus stable isotope labeling.
22512932|a|BACKGROUND: Abnormal proteostasis due to alterations in protein turnover has been postulated to play a central role in several neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, the development of techniques to quantify protein turnover in the brain is critical for understanding the pathogenic mechanisms of these diseases. We have developed a bolus stable isotope-labeling kinetics (SILK) technique coupled with multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry to measure the clearance of proteins in the mouse brain. RESULTS: Cohorts of mice were pulse labeled with 13C6-leucine and the brains were isolated after pre-determined time points. The extent of label incorporation was measured over time using mass spectrometry to measure the ratio of labeled to unlabeled apolipoprotein E (apoE) and amyloid beta (Abeta). The fractional clearance rate (FCR) was then calculated by analyzing the time course of disappearance for the labeled protein species. To validate the technique, apoE clearance was measured in mice that overexpress the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). The FCR in these mice was 2.7-fold faster than wild-type mice. To demonstrate the potential of this technique for understanding the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease, we applied our SILK technique to determine the effect of ATP binding cassette A1 (ABCA1) on both apoE and Abeta clearance. ABCA1 had previously been shown to regulate both the amount of apoE in the brain, along with the extent of Abeta deposition, and represents a potential molecular target for lowering brain amyloid levels in Alzheimer's disease patients. The FCR of apoE was increased by 1.9- and 1.5-fold in mice that either lacked or overexpressed ABCA1, respectively. However, ABCA1 had no effect on the FCR of Abeta, suggesting that ABCA1 does not regulate Abeta metabolism in the brain. CONCLUSIONS: Our SILK strategy represents a straightforward, cost-effective, and efficient method to measure the clearance of proteins in the mouse brain. We expect that this technique will be applicable to the study of protein dynamics in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, and could aid in the evaluation of novel therapeutic agents.

22514144|t|Novel APP/Abeta mutation K16N produces highly toxic heteromeric Abeta oligomers.
22514144|a|Here, we describe a novel missense mutation in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) causing a lysine-to-asparagine substitution at position 687 (APP770; herein, referred to as K16N according to amyloid-beta (Abeta) numbering) resulting in an early onset dementia with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. The K16N mutation is located exactly at the alpha-secretase cleavage site and influences both APP and Abeta. First, due to the K16N mutation APP secretion is affected and a higher amount of Abeta peptides is being produced. Second, Abeta peptides carrying the K16N mutation are unique in that the peptide itself is not harmful to neuronal cells. Severe toxicity, however, is evident upon equimolar mixture of wt and mutant peptides, mimicking the heterozygous state of the subject. Furthermore, Abeta42 K16N inhibits fibril formation of Abeta42 wild-type. Even more, Abeta42 K16N peptides are protected against clearance activity by the major Abeta-degrading enzyme neprilysin. Thus the mutation characterized here harbours a combination of risk factors that synergistically may contribute to the development of early onset Alzheimer disease.

22514310|t|Memory deficits of British dementia knock-in mice are prevented by Abeta-precursor protein haploinsufficiency.
22514310|a|Familial British Dementia (FBD) is caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in the BRI2/ITM2B gene (Vidal et al., 1999). FBD(KI) mice are a model of FBD that is genetically congruous to the human disease, because they carry one mutant and one wild-type Bri2/Itm2b allele. Analysis of these mice has shown that the British mutation causes memory impairments due to loss of Bri2 function (Tamayev et al., 2010b). BRI2 is a physiologic inhibitor of processing of the Abeta-precursor protein (APP; Matsuda et al., 2008), a gene associated with Alzheimer's disease (Bertram et al., 2010). Here we show that APP haploinsufficiency prevents memory dysfunctions seen in FBD(KI) mice. This genetic suppression is consistent with a role for APP in the pathogenesis of memory deficits. Moreover, it provides compelling evidence that the memory dysfunctions caused by the British BRI2 mutant are dependent on endogenous APP and that BRI2 and APP functionally interact. This evidence establishes a mechanistic connection between Familial British and Alzheimer's dementias.

22515098|a|Human Parathyroid hormone 1-34 (PTH1-34) loaded chitosan nanoparticles (PTH 1-34 chitosan nanoparticles) via simple ionic gelation technique were prepared which can improve the bioavailability and half-life of the peptide. Chitosan nanoparticles and PTH 1-34 chitosan nanoparticles were synthesised and characterized by DLS, SEM, AFM, FT-IR and TG/DTA. Chitosan nanoparticles (40-60 nm) and PTH 1-34 chitosan nanoparticles (60-80 nm) with zeta potential of +60 and +40 mV respectively were subjected to haemolysis assay and tested for agglomeration in blood. MTT and LDH was performed assay using Saos-2, UMR 106, L929, NIH3T3. The in vitro peptide release profile at pH 7.5 for 144 h was quantified using PTH 1-34 ELISA Kit. Effect of released PTH 1-34 on Saos-2 was determined with ALP and BCA assay. These preliminary results pave way for the prospective use of such a carrier for the delivery of PTH 1-34 by multiple routes for the benefit of patients undergoing treatment for osteoporosis.

22516235|t|The location and trafficking routes of the neuronal retromer and its role in amyloid precursor protein transport.
22516235|a|The retromer complex plays an important role in intracellular transport, is highly expressed in the hippocampus, and has been implicated in the trafficking of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Nevertheless, the trafficking routes of the neuronal retromer and the role it plays in APP transport in neuronal processes remain unknown. Here we use hippocampal neuronal cultures to address these issues. Using fluorescence microscopy, we find that Vps35, the core element of the retromer complex, is in dendrites and axons, is enriched in endosomes and trans-Golgi network, and is found in APP-positive vesicles. Next, to identify the role the neuronal retromer plays in cargo transport, we infected hippocampal neurons with a lentivirus expressing shRNA to silence Vps35. By live fluorescence imaging, Vps35 deficiency was found to reduce the frequency, but not the kinetics, of long-range APP transport within neuronal processes. Supporting the interpretation that retromer promotes long-range transport, Vps35 deficiency led to increased APP in the early endosomes, in processes but not the soma. Finally, Vps35 deficiency was associated with increased levels of Abeta, a cleaved product of APP, increased colocalization of APP with its cleaving enzyme BACE1 in processes, and caused an enlargement of early endosomes. Taken together, our studies clarify the function of the neuronal retromer, and suggest specific mechanisms for how retromer dysfunction observed in Alzheimer's disease affects APP transport and processing.

22518836|t|Mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle of amyloid precursor protein-overexpressing mice.
22518836|a|Inclusion body myositis, the most common muscle disorder in the elderly, is partly characterized by abnormal expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and intracellular accumulation of its proteolytic fragments collectively known as beta-amyloid. The present study examined the effects of beta-amyloid accumulation on mitochondrial structure and function of skeletal muscle from transgenic mice (MCK-betaAPP) engineered to accumulate intramyofiber beta-amyloid. Electron microscopic analysis revealed that a large fraction of myofibers from 2-3-month-old MCK-betaAPP mice contained numerous, heterogeneous alterations in mitochondria, and other cellular organelles. [(1)H-decoupled](13)C NMR spectroscopy showed a substantial reduction in TCA cycle activity and indicated a switch from aerobic to anaerobic glucose metabolism in the MCK-betaAPP muscle. Isolated muscle fibers from the MCK-betaAPP mice also exhibited a reduction in cytoplasmic pH, an increased rate of ROS production, and a partially depolarized plasmalemma. Treatment of MCK-betaAPP muscle cells with Ru360, a mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter antagonist, reversed alterations in the plasmalemmal membrane potential (V(m)) and pH. Consistent with altered redox state of the cells, treatment of MCK-betaAPP muscle cells with glutathione reversed the effects of beta-amyloid accumulation on Ca(2+) transient amplitudes. We conclude that structural and functional alterations in mitochondria precede the reported appearance of histopathological and clinical features in the MCK-betaAPP mice and may represent key early events in the pathogenesis of inclusion body myositis.

22519988|t|sAPPalpha rescues deficits in amyloid precursor protein knockout mice following focal traumatic brain injury.
22519988|a|The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is thought to be neuroprotective following traumatic brain injury (TBI), although definitive evidence at moderate to severe levels of injury is lacking. In the current study, we investigated histological and functional outcomes in APP-/- mice compared with APP+/+ mice following a moderate focal injury, and whether administration of sAPPalpha restored the outcomes in knockout animals back to the wildtype state. Following moderate controlled cortical impact injury, APP-/- mice demonstrated greater impairment in motor and cognitive outcome as determined by the ledged beam and Barnes Maze tests respectively (p < 0.05). This corresponded with the degree of neuronal damage, with APP-/- mice having significantly greater lesion volume (25.0 +- 1.6 vs. 20.3 +- 1.6%, p < 0.01) and hippocampal damage, with less remaining CA neurons (839 +- 245 vs. 1353 +- 142 and 1401 +- 263). This was also associated with an impaired neuroreparative response, with decreased GAP-43 immunoreactivity within the cortex around the lesion edge compared with APP+/+ mice. The deficits observed in the APP-/- mice related to a lack of sAPPalpha, as treatment with exogenously added sAPPalpha post-injury improved APP-/- mice histological and functional outcome to the point that they were no longer significantly different to APP+/+ mice (p < 0.05). This study shows that endogenous APP is potentially protective at moderate levels of TBI, and that this neuroprotective activity is related to the presence of sAPPalpha. Importantly, it indicates that the mechanism of action of exogenously added sAPPalpha is independent of the presence of endogenous APP.

22521230|t|Identification of two novel synaptic gamma-secretase associated proteins that affect amyloid beta-peptide levels without altering Notch processing.
22521230|a|Synaptic degeneration is one of the earliest hallmarks of Alzheimer disease (AD) and results in loss of cognitive function. One of the causative agents for the synaptic degeneration is the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta), which is formed from its precursor protein by two sequential cleavages mediated by beta- and gamma-secretase. We have earlier shown that gamma-secretase activity is enriched in synaptic compartments, suggesting that the synaptotoxic Abeta is produced locally. Proteins that interact with gamma-secretase at the synapse and regulate the production of Abeta can therefore be potential therapeutic targets. We used a recently developed affinity purification approach to identify gamma-secretase associated proteins (GSAPs) in synaptic membranes and synaptic vesicles prepared from rat brain. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of the affinity purified samples revealed the known gamma-secretase components presenilin-1, nicastrin and Aph-1b along with a number of novel potential GSAPs. To investigate the effect of these GSAPs on APP processing, we performed siRNA experiments to knock down the expression of the GSAPs and measured the Abeta levels. Silencing of NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] iron-sulfur protein 7 (NDUFS7) resulted in a decrease in Abeta levels whereas silencing of tubulin polymerization promoting protein (TPPP) resulted in an increase in Abeta levels. Treatment with gamma-secretase inhibitors often results in Notch-related side effects and therefore we also studied the effect of the siRNAs on Notch processing. Interestingly, silencing of TPPP or NDUFS7 did not affect cleavage of Notch. We also studied the expression of TPPP and NDUFS7 in control and AD brain and found NDUFS7 to be highly expressed in vulnerable neurons such as pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus, whereas TPPP was found to accumulate in intraneuronal granules and fibrous structures in hippocampus from AD cases. In summary, we here report on two proteins, TPPP and NDUFS7, which interact with gamma-secretase and alter the Abeta levels without affecting Notch cleavage.

22522254|t|Two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy reveals the complex behaviour of an amyloid fibril inhibitor.
22522254|a|Amyloid formation has been implicated in the pathology of over 20 human diseases, but the rational design of amyloid inhibitors is hampered by a lack of structural information about amyloid-inhibitor complexes. We use isotope labelling and two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy to obtain a residue-specific structure for the complex of human amylin (the peptide responsible for islet amyloid formation in type 2 diabetes) with a known inhibitor (rat amylin). Based on its sequence, rat amylin should block formation of the C-terminal beta-sheet, but at 8 h after mixing, rat amylin blocks the N-terminal beta-sheet instead. At 24 h after mixing, rat amylin blocks neither beta-sheet and forms its own beta-sheet, most probably on the outside of the human fibrils. This is striking, because rat amylin is natively disordered and not previously known to form amyloid beta-sheets. The results show that even seemingly intuitive inhibitors may function by unforeseen and complex structural processes.

22522311|t|Interaction structure of the complex between neuroprotective factor humanin and Alzheimer's beta-amyloid peptide revealed by affinity mass spectrometry and molecular modeling.
22522311|a|Humanin (HN) is a linear 24-aa peptide recently detected in human Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. HN specifically inhibits neuronal cell death in vitro induced by ss-amyloid (Ass) peptides and by amyloid precursor protein and its gene mutations in familial AD, thereby representing a potential therapeutic lead structure for AD; however, its molecular mechanism of action is not well understood. We report here the identification of the binding epitopes between HN and Ass(1-40) and characterization of the interaction structure through a molecular modeling study. Wild-type HN and HN-sequence mutations were synthesized by SPPS and the HPLC-purified peptides characterized by MALDI-MS. The interaction epitopes between HN and Ass(1-40) were identified by affinity-MS using proteolytic epitope excision and extraction, followed by elution and mass spectrometric characterization of the affinity-bound peptides. The affinity-MS analyses revealed HN(5-15) as the epitope sequence of HN, whereas Ass(17-28) was identified as the Ass interaction epitope. The epitopes and binding sites were ascertained by ELISA of the complex of HN peptides with immobilized Ass(1-40) and by ELISA with Ass(1-40) and Ass-partial sequences as ligands to immobilized HN. The specificity and affinity of the HN-Ass interaction were characterized by direct ESI-MS of the HN-Ass(1-40) complex and by bioaffinity analysis using a surface acoustic wave biosensor, providing a K(D) of the complex of 610 nm. A molecular dynamics simulation of the HN-Ass(1-40) complex was consistent with the binding specificity and shielding effects of the HN and Ass interaction epitopes. These results indicate a specific strong association of HN and Ass(1-40) polypeptide and provide a molecular basis for understanding the neuroprotective function of HN.

22522613|t|Amyloid-beta induces hepatic insulin resistance by activating JAK2/STAT3/SOCS-1 signaling pathway.
22522613|a|Epidemiological studies indicate that patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and experimental studies suggest that AD exacerbates T2DM, but the underlying mechanism is still largely unknown. This study aims to investigate whether amyloid-beta (Abeta), a key player in AD pathogenesis, contributes to the development of insulin resistance, as well as the underlying mechanism. We find that plasma Abeta40/42 levels are increased in patients with hyperglycemia. APPswe/PSEN1dE9 transgenic AD model mice with increased plasma Abeta40/42 levels show impaired glucose and insulin tolerance and hyperinsulinemia. Furthermore, Abeta impairs insulin signaling in mouse liver and cultured hepatocytes. Abeta can upregulate suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-1, a well-known insulin signaling inhibitor. Knockdown of SOCS-1 alleviates Abeta-induced impairment of insulin signaling. Moreover, JAK2/STAT3 is activated by Abeta, and inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 signaling attenuates Abeta-induced upregulation of SOCS-1 and insulin resistance in hepatocytes. Our results demonstrate that Abeta induces hepatic insulin resistance by activating JAK2/STAT3/SOCS-1 signaling pathway and have implications toward resolving insulin resistance and T2DM.

22524677|t|Interaction of superoxide dismutase with the glycine zipper regions of beta-amyloid peptides: is there an implication towards Alzheimer's disease and oxidative stress?
22524677|a|Not only are beta-amyloid peptides and senile plaque deposits characteristics in Alzheimer's disease but there is growing evidence to suggest that oxidative stress also plays a role with a decrease in levels of brain superoxide dismutase (SOD), an enzyme that catalyses the dismutation of superoxide radicals into molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. We show through kinetic and fluorescence analysis that beta-amyloid peptides, in the glycine zipper region [Abeta29-33 and Abeta25-37] of Abeta1-40 interact with, and inhibit, SOD directly. The enzyme was purified 15.7-fold from bovine brain by DEAE-Sepharose ion exchange chromatography in a yield of 68.8% and specific activity of 3.66 U.mg(-1). The subunit structure of the enzyme was monomeric with a molecular mass of 13 kDa, as estimated by SDS-PAGE. Inhibitor constants (Ki) and dissociation constants (Kd) were calculated as 14.44, 13.16 and 11.72 microM and 9.38, 15.7 and 12.13 for Abeta25-37, Abeta29-33 and Abeta1-40, respectively; the number of binding sites on the enzyme for the peptides was 1.

22524821|t|Global school personnel survey among 5200 school personnel in India: comparison of the results for the years 2009 and 2006.
22524821|a|BACKGROUND: The results of the Global School Personnel Survey (GSPS) conducted in India in 2009 are compared with 2006 GSPS to assess any change in 2009 on tobacco use and knowledge and attitudes to tobacco use, training and availability of tobacco control teaching material in schools and the existence of school tobacco control policies. METHODS: GSPS is a cross sectional survey conducted twice (2006 and 2009) in entire India. A total of 180 schools were surveyed each time. RESULTS: Of the participating school personnel, 2660 in 2006 and 2575 in 2009, about 95% were teachers and the balance administrators. In 2009, compared to 2006 the prevalence of current smoking of cigarettes (19.6% in 2006 and 10.3% in 2009) and bidis (21.5% in 2006 and 13.9% in 2009) was found to be significantly lower; the percentage of teachers receiving training on preventing youth tobacco use has significantly reduced (16.7% in 2006 and 10.1% in 2009); access of teachers to educational materials on tobacco use and how to prevent its use among youth had not increased (34.6% in 2006 and 37.8% in 2009); there was no change in policy prohibiting tobacco use among students and school personnel; however, ever use of any tobacco on school premises was significantly lower (15.6% in 2006 and 9.6% in 2009). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of current smoking (cigarettes/bidis) among school personnel and use of any tobacco on school premises were significantly decreased in 2009 as compared to 2006. Necessary action should be planned to increase the number of teachers trained and the availability of teaching materials on preventing youth tobacco use in order to have effective prevention of tobacco use among students.

22526016|t|Mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms specifically modify cerebral beta-amyloid proteostasis.
22526016|a|Several lines of evidence link mutations and deletions in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and its maternal inheritance to neurodegenerative diseases in the elderly. Age-related mutations of mtDNA modulate the tricarboxylic cycle enzyme activity, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation capacity and oxidative stress response. To investigate the functional relevance of specific mtDNA polymorphisms of inbred mouse strains in the proteostasis regulation of the brain, we established novel mitochondrial congenic mouse lines of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We crossed females from inbred strains (FVB/N, AKR/J, NOD/LtJ) with C57BL/6 males for at least ten generations to gain specific mitochondrial conplastic strains with pure C57BL/6 nuclear backgrounds. We show that specific mtDNA polymorphisms originating from the inbred strains differentially influence mitochondrial energy metabolism, ATP production and ATP-driven microglial activity, resulting in alterations of cerebral beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation. Our findings demonstrate that mtDNA-related increases in ATP levels and subsequently in microglial activity are directly linked to decreased Abeta accumulation in vivo, implicating reduced mitochondrial function in microglia as a causative factor in the development of age-related cerebral proteopathies such as AD.

22526019|t|CSF biomarkers cutoffs: the importance of coincident neuropathological diseases.
22526019|a|The effects of applying clinical versus neuropathological diagnosis and the inclusion of cases with coincident neuropathological diagnoses have not been assessed specifically when studying cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker classification cutoffs for patients with neurodegenerative diseases that cause dementia. Thus, 142 neuropathologically diagnosed neurodegenerative dementia patients [71 Alzheimer's disease (AD), 29 frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), 3 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 7 dementia with Lewy bodies, 32 of which cases also had coincident diagnoses] were studied. 96 % had enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) CSF data and 77 % had Luminex CSF data, with 43 and 46 controls for comparison, respectively. Abeta(42), total, and phosphorylated tau(181) were measured. Clinical and neuropathological diagnoses showed an 81.4 % overall agreement. Both assays showed high sensitivity and specificity to classify AD subjects against FTLD subjects and controls, and moderate sensitivity and specificity for classifying FTLD subjects against controls. However, among the cases with neuropathological diagnoses of AD plus another pathology (26.8 % of the sample), 69.4 % (ELISA) and 96.4 % (Luminex) were classified as AD according to their biomarker profiles. Use of clinical diagnosis instead of neuropathological diagnosis led to a 14-17 % underestimation of the biomarker accuracy. These results show that while CSF Abeta and tau assays are useful for diagnosis of AD and neurodegenerative diseases even at MCI stages, CSF diagnostic analyte panels that establish a positive diagnosis of Lewy body disease and FTLD are also needed, and must be established based on neuropathological rather than clinical diagnoses.

22527776|t|Cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta 2-42 is decreased in Alzheimer's, but not in frontotemporal dementia.
22527776|a|Alzheimer's dementia (AD) and frontotemporal dementias (FTD) are common and their clinical differential diagnosis may be complicated by overlapping symptoms, which is why biomarkers may have an important role to play. Cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) Abeta2-42 and 1-42 have been shown to be similarly decreased in AD, but 1-42 did not display sufficient specificity for exclusion of other dementias from AD. The objective of the present study was to clarify the diagnostic value of Abeta2-42 peptides for the differential diagnosis of AD from FTD. For this purpose, 20 non-demented disease controls (NDC), 22 patients with AD and 17 with FTD were comparatively analysed by a novel sequential aminoterminally and carboxyterminally specific immunoprecipitation protocol with subsequent Abeta-SDS-PAGE/immunoblot, allowing the quantification of peptides 1-38(ox), 2-40 and 2-42 along with Abeta 1-37, 1-38, 1-39, 1-40, 1-40(ox) and 1-42. CSF Abeta1-42 was decreased in AD as compared to NDC, but not to FTD. In a subgroup of the patients analyzed, the decrease of Abeta2-42 in AD was evident as compared to both NDC and FTD. Abeta1-38 was decreased in FTD as compared to NDC and AD. For differentiating AD from FTD, Abeta1-42 demonstrated sufficient diagnostic accuracies only when combined with Abeta1-38. Abeta2-42 yielded diagnostic accuracies of over 85 % as a single marker. These accuracy figures could be improved by combining Abeta2-42 to Abeta1-38. Abeta2-42 seems to be a promising biomarker for differentiating AD from other degenerative dementias, such as FTD.

22528459|t|Potential contribution of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha, aquaporin-4, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 to blood-brain barrier disruption and brain edema after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage.
22528459|a|The current research aimed to investigate the role of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), aquaporin-4 (AQP-4), and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction and cerebral edema formation in a rat subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) model. The SAH model was induced by injection of 0.3 ml fresh arterial, non-heparinized blood into the prechiasmatic cistern in 20 s. Anti-AQP-4 antibody, minocycline (an inhibitor of MMP-9), or 2-methoxyestradiol (an inhibitor of HIF-1alpha), was administered intravenously at 2 and 24 h after SAH. Brain samples were extracted at 48 h after SAH and examined for protein expressions, BBB impairment, and brain edema. Following SAH, remarkable edema and BBB extravasations were observed. Compared with the control group, the SAH animals have significantly upregulated expressions of HIF-1alpha, AQP-4, and MMP-9, in addition to decreased amounts of laminin and tight junction proteins. Brain edema was repressed after inhibition of AQP-4, MMP-9, or HIF-1alpha. Although BBB permeability was also ameliorated after inhibition of either HIF-1alpha or MMP-9, it was not modulated after inhibition of AQP-4. Inhibition of MMP-9 reversed the loss of laminin. Finally, inhibition of HIF-1alpha significantly suppressed the level of AQP-4 and MMP-9, which could induce the expression of laminin and tight junction proteins. Our results suggest that HIF-1alpha plays a role in brain edema formation and BBB disruption via a molecular signaling pathway involving AQP-4 and MMP-9. Pharmacological intervention of this pathway in patients with SAH may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for early brain injury.

22528492|t|Zn2+-Abeta40 complexes form metastable quasi-spherical oligomers that are cytotoxic to cultured hippocampal neurons.
22528492|a|The roles of metal ions in promoting amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) oligomerization associated with Alzheimer disease are increasingly recognized. However, the detailed structures dictating toxicity remain elusive for Abeta oligomers stabilized by metal ions. Here, we show that small Zn(2+)-bound Abeta1-40 (Zn(2+)-Abeta40) oligomers formed in cell culture medium exhibit quasi-spherical structures similar to native amylospheroids isolated recently from Alzheimer disease patients. These quasi-spherical Zn(2+)-Abeta40 oligomers irreversibly inhibit spontaneous neuronal activity and cause massive cell death in primary hippocampal neurons. Spectroscopic and x-ray diffraction structural analyses indicate that despite their non-fibrillar morphology, the metastable Zn(2+)-Abeta40 oligomers are rich in beta-sheet and cross-beta structures. Thus, Zn(2+) promotes Abeta40 neurotoxicity by structural organization mechanisms mediated by coordination chemistry.

22529247|t|Amyloid-beta--associated clinical decline occurs only in the presence of elevated P-tau.
22529247|a|OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the relationship between the 2 hallmark proteins of Alzheimer disease (AD), amyloid-(Abeta) and tau, and clinical decline over time among cognitively normal older individuals. DESIGN: A longitudinal cohort of clinically and cognitively normal older individuals assessed with baseline lumbar puncture and longitudinal clinical assessments. SETTING: Research centers across the United States and Canada. PATIENTS: We examined 107 participants with a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) of 0 at baseline examination. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Using linear mixed effects models, we investigated the relationship between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phospho-tau 181 (p-tau(181p)),CSF Abeta(1-42), and clinical decline as assessed using longitudinal change in global CDR, CDR-Sum of Boxes, and the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale. RESULTS: We found a significant relationship between decreased CSF Abeta(1-42) and longitudinal change in global CDR,CDR-Sum of Boxes, and Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale in individuals with elevated CSFp-tau(181p). In the absence of CSF p-tau(181p), the effect of CSF Abeta(1-42) on longitudinal clinical decline was not significantly different from 0. CONCLUSIONS: In cognitively normal older individuals,A-associated clinical decline during a mean of 3 years may occur only in the presence of ongoing downstream neurodegeneration.

22531418|t|Amyloid-beta(1-15/16) as a marker for gamma-secretase inhibition in Alzheimer's disease.
22531418|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) producing enzymes are key targets for disease-modifying Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapies since Abeta trafficking is at the core of AD pathogenesis. Development of such drugs might benefit from the identification of markers indicating in vivo drug effects in the central nervous system. We have previously shown that Abeta(1-15) is produced by concerted beta-and alpha-secretase cleavage of amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP). Here, we test the hypothesis that this pathway is more engaged upon gamma-secretase inhibition in humans, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of Abeta(1-15/16) represent a biomarker for this effect. Twenty healthy men were treated with placebo (n = 5) or the gamma-secretase inhibitor semagacestat (100 mg [n = 5], 140 mg [n = 5], or 280 mg [n = 5]). CSF samples were collected hourly over 36 hours and 10 time points were analyzed by immunoassay for Abeta(1-15/16), Abeta(x-38), Abeta(x-40), Abeta(x-42), sAbetaPPalpha, and sAbetaPPbeta. The CSF concentration of Abeta(1-15/16) showed a dose-dependent response over 36 hours. In the 280 mg treatment group, a transient increase was seen with a maximum of 180% relative to baseline at 9 hours post administration of semagacestat. The concentrations of Abeta(x-38), Abeta(x-40), and Abeta(x-42) decreased the first 9 hours followed by increased concentrations after 36 hours relative to baseline. No significant changes were detected for CSF sAbetaPPalpha and sAbetaPPbeta. Our data shows that CSF levels of Abeta(1-15/16) increase during treatment with semagacestat supporting its feasibility as a pharmacodynamic biomarker for drug candidates aimed at inhibiting gamma-secretase-mediated AbetaPP-processing.

22531425|t|Decreased accumulation of subcellular amyloid-beta with improved mitochondrial function mediates the neuroprotective effect of huperzine A.
22531425|a|A number of recent discoveries indicate that huperzine A, an active herbal medicine employed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in China, can afford neuroprotection on in vitro and in vivo models related to mitochondrial dysfunction. However, it is an intricate and highly debated research topic about whether another pharmacological mechanism is involved in the beneficial profiles of huperzine A, independent of its well-recognized potent acetycholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory effect. As an extension, this study for the first time verified the co-occurrence of the beneficial effects of huperzine A on mitochondrial dysfunction and memory deficits in AbetaPP/PS1 double transgenic mice, at a time point that AChE was not inhibited. Moreover, using isolated brain cortical mitochondria, we confirmed the ameliorating effect of huperzine A on oligomeric Abeta1-42-induced ATP reduction and mitochondrial swelling, as well as a decrease in the enzymatic activities of respiratory chain complexes, especially complex II-III and complex IV, which may be attributed to the blockage of oligomeric Abeta1-42 from penetrating into mitochondria. These results shed more light on a potential direct target of huperzine A on isolated mitochondria, which may be largely different from its specific inhibition on AChE. This work describes a novel mechanism of neuroprotection by huperzine A and provides important clues for discovering novel therapeutic strategy for AD.

22532452|t|Characterization of cerebrospinal fluid aminoterminally truncated and oxidized amyloid-beta peptides.
22532452|a|PURPOSE: Carboxyterminally elongated and aminoterminally truncated Abeta peptides as well as their pyroglutamate and oxidized derivates are major constituents of human amyloid plaques. The objective of the present study was to characterize aminoterminally truncated or oxidized Abeta38, Abeta40, and Abeta42 peptide species in immunoprecipitated human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We invented a novel sequential aminoterminally and carboxyterminally specific immunoprecipitation protocol and used the Abeta-SDS-PAGE/immunoblot for subsequent analysis of CSF Abeta peptide patterns. RESULTS: In the present study, we identified the aminoterminally truncated Abeta peptides 2-40 and 2-42 as well as oxidized forms of Abeta1-38 and Abeta1-42 in CSF. Our protocol allowed the quantification of a pattern of Abeta peptides 1-38(ox), 2-40, and 2-42 in addition to the well known panel of Abeta 1-37, 1-38, 1-39, 1-40, 1-40(ox), and 1-42 in a group of seven patients with peripheral polyneuropathy. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In the present approach, we could broaden the range of quantifiable Abeta peptides described in previous studies (i.e., 1-37, 1-38, 1-39, 1-40, 1-40(ox), and 1-42) by Abeta 1-38(ox), 2-40, and 2-42. An exact analysis of CSF Abeta peptides regarding their carboxy- and aminoterminus as well as posttranslational modification seems promising with respect to diagnostic and pathogenic aspects.

22532566|t|Generation of Alzheimer disease-associated amyloid beta42/43 peptide by gamma-secretase can be inhibited directly by modulation of membrane thickness.
22532566|a|Pathogenic generation of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) by sequential cleavage of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretases is widely believed to causally underlie Alzheimer disease (AD). beta-Secretase initially cleaves APP thereby generating a membrane-bound APP C-terminal fragment, from which gamma-secretase subsequently liberates 37-43-amino acid long Abeta species. Although the latter cleavages are intramembranous and although lipid alterations have been implicated in AD, little is known of how the gamma-secretase-mediated release of the various Abeta species, in particular that of the pathogenic longer variants Abeta(42) and Abeta(43), is affected by the lipid environment. Using a cell-free system, we have directly and systematically investigated the activity of gamma-secretase reconstituted in defined model membranes of different thicknesses. We found that bilayer thickness is a critical parameter affecting both total activity as well as cleavage specificity of gamma-secretase. Whereas the generation of the pathogenic Abeta(42/43) species was markedly attenuated in thick membranes, that of the major and rather benign Abeta(40) species was enhanced. Moreover, the increased production of Abeta(42/43) by familial AD mutants of presenilin 1, the catalytic subunit of gamma-secretase, could be substantially lowered in thick membranes. Our data demonstrate an effective modulation of gamma-secretase activity by membrane thickness, which may provide an approach to lower the generation of the pathogenic Abeta(42/43) species.

22533419|t|Identification and characterization of an abeta oligomer precipitating peptide that may be useful to explore gene therapeutic approaches to Alzheimer disease.
22533419|a|A key feature of Alzheimer disease (AD) is the pathologic self-association of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide, leading to the formation of diffusible toxic Abeta oligomers and extracellular amyloid plaques. Next to extracellular Abeta, intraneuronal Abeta has important pathological functions in AD. Agents that specifically interfere with the oligomerization processes either outside or inside of neurons are highly desired for the elucidation of the pathologic mechanisms of AD and might even pave the way for new AD gene therapeutic approaches. Here, we characterize the Abeta binding peptide L3 and its influence on Abeta oligomerization in vitro. Preliminary studies in cell culture demonstrate that stably expressed L3 reduces cell toxicity of externally added Abeta in neuroblastoma cells.

22534065|t|Control of Abeta release from human neurons by differentiation status and RET signaling.
22534065|a|Few studies have compared the processing of endogenous human amyloid precursor protein (APP) in younger and older neurons. Here, we characterized LUHMES cells as a human model to study Alzheimer's disease-related processes during neuronal maturation and aging. Differentiated LUHMES expressed and spontaneously processed APP via the secretase pathways, and they secreted amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide. This was inhibited by cholesterol depletion or secretase inhibition, but not by block of tau phosphorylation. In vitro aged cells increased Abeta secretion without upregulation of APP or secretases. We identified the medium constituent glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) as responsible for this effect. GDNF-triggered Abeta release was associated with rapid upregulation of the GDNF coreceptor "rearranged during transfection" (RET). Other direct (neurturin) or indirect (nerve growth factor) RET activators also increased Abeta, whereas different neurotrophins were ineffective. Downstream of RET, we found activation of protein kinase B (AKT) to be involved. Accordingly, inhibitors of the AKT regulator phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase completely blocked GDNF-triggered AKT phosphorylation and Abeta increase. This suggests that RET signaling affects Abeta release from aging neurons.

22535616|t|Dietary intakes of berries and flavonoids in relation to cognitive decline.
22535616|a|OBJECTIVE: Berries are high in flavonoids, especially anthocyanidins, and improve cognition in experimental studies. We prospectively evaluated whether greater long-term intakes of berries and flavonoids are associated with slower rates of cognitive decline in older women. METHODS: Beginning in 1980, a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire was administered every 4 years to Nurses' Health Study participants. In 1995-2001, we began measuring cognitive function in 16,010 participants, aged >=70 years; follow-up assessments were conducted twice, at 2-year intervals. To ascertain long-term diet, we averaged dietary variables from 1980 through the initial cognitive interview. Using multivariate-adjusted, mixed linear regression, we estimated mean differences in slopes of cognitive decline by long-term berry and flavonoid intakes. RESULTS: Greater intakes of blueberries and strawberries were associated with slower rates of cognitive decline (eg, for a global score averaging all 6 cognitive tests, for blueberries: p-trend = 0.014 and mean difference = 0.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.01-0.07, comparing extreme categories of intake; for strawberries: p-trend = 0.022 and mean difference = 0.03, 95% CI = 0.00-0.06, comparing extreme categories of intake), after adjusting for multiple potential confounders. These effect estimates were equivalent to those we found for approximately 1.5 to 2.5 years of age in our cohort, indicating that berry intake appears to delay cognitive aging by up to 2.5 years. Additionally, in further supporting evidence, greater intakes of anthocyanidins and total flavonoids were associated with slower rates of cognitive decline (p-trends = 0.015 and 0.053, respectively, for the global score). INTERPRETATION: Higher intake of flavonoids, particularly from berries, appears to reduce rates of cognitive decline in older adults.

22536844|t|Thermodynamic analysis of the molecular interactions between amyloid beta-protein fragments and (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate.
22536844|a|(-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) has been proven effective in preventing the aggregation of amyloid beta-protein 42 (Abeta42), and the thermodynamic interactions between Abeta42 and EGCG have been studied in our previous work ( J. Phys. Chem. B 2010, 114, 11576). Herein, to further probe the interactions between different regions of Abeta42 and EGCG, three Abeta42 fragments (i.e., Abeta1-16, Abeta1-30, and Abeta31-42) were synthesized, and the thermodynamic interactions between each of the fragments and EGCG at different EGCG and salt concentrations were investigated by isothermal titration calorimetry. The results indicate that, although hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction are both involved in the interactions between Abeta42 and EGCG, hydrogen bonding mainly happens in Abeta1-16 while hydrophobic interaction mainly happens in Abeta17-42. It is found that when Abeta42 and its fragments are saturated by EGCG, their thermodynamic parameters have linear relationships. The saturated binding stoichiometry (N(s)) for Abeta42 is the sum of the N(s) values for Abeta1-30 and Abeta31-42, while DeltaH(s), DeltaS(s), and DeltaG(s) for Abeta42 are half the sum of the values for Abeta1-30 and Abeta31-42. The result suggests that there are no specific interactions and binding sites in the Abeta42 and EGCG binding. The orders of DeltaH(s) and TDeltaS(s) values for the Abeta fragments are determined as Abeta17-42 > Abeta31-42 > Abeta1-30 > Abeta1-16. Moreover, there is significant enthalpy-entropy compensation in the binding of EGCG to Abeta42 and its fragments, resulting in insignificant change of DeltaG with the change of the solution environment. The research has shed new light on the molecular mechanisms of the interactions between EGCG and Abeta42.

22537779|t|Reduction of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP1) in hippocampal neurons does not proportionately reduce, or otherwise alter, amyloid deposition in APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice.
22537779|a|INTRODUCTION: The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP1) and its family members have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Multiple susceptibility factors converge to metabolic pathways that involve LRP1, including modulation of the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the clearance of Abeta peptide. METHODS: We used the Cre-lox system to lower LRP1 levels in hippocampal neurons of mice that develop Alzheimer-type amyloid by crosses between mice that express Cre recombinase under the transcriptional control of the GFAP promoter, mice that harbor loxp sites in the LRP1 gene, and the APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic model. We compared amyloid plaque numbers in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice lacking LRP1 expression in hippocampus (n = 13) to mice with normal levels of LRP1 (n = 12). Student t-test was used to test whether there were significant differences in plaque numbers and amyloid levels between the groups. A regression model was used to fit two regression lines for these groups, and to compare the rates of Abeta accumulation. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated efficient elimination of LRP1 expression in the CA fields and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Within hippocampus, we observed no effect on the severity of amyloid deposition, the rate of Abeta40/42 accumulation, or the architecture of amyloid plaques when LRP1 levels were reduced. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of LRP1 by neurons in proximity to senile amyloid plaques does not appear to play a major role in modulating the formation of these proximal deposits or in the appearance of the associated neuritic pathology.

22539844|t|A reversible early oxidized redox state that precedes macromolecular ROS damage in aging nontransgenic and 3xTg-AD mouse neurons.
22539844|a|The brain depends on redox electrons from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced form; NADH) to produce ATP and oxyradicals (reactive oxygen species [ROS]). Because ROS damage and mitochondrial dysregulation are prominent in aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their relationship to the redox state is unclear, we wanted to know whether an oxidative redox shift precedes these markers and leads to macromolecular damage in a mouse model of AD. We used the 3xTg-AD mouse model, which displays cognitive deficits beginning at 4 months. Hippocampal/cortical neurons were isolated across the age span and cultured in common nutrients to control for possible hormonal and vascular differences. We found an increase of NAD(P)H levels and redox state in nontransgenic (non-Tg) neurons until middle age, followed by a decline in old age. The 3xTg-AD neurons maintained much lower resting NAD(P)H and redox states after 4 months, but the NADH regenerating capacity continuously declined with age beginning at 2 months. These redox characteristics were partially reversible with nicotinamide, a biosynthetic precursor of NAD+. Nicotinamide also protected against glutamate excitotoxicity. Compared with non-Tg neurons, 3xTg-AD neurons had more mitochondria/neuron and lower glutathione (GSH) levels that preceded age-related increases in ROS levels. These GSH deficits were again reversible with nicotinamide in 3xTg-AD neurons. Surprisingly, low macromolecular ROS damage was only elevated after 4 months in the 3xTg-AD neurons if antioxidants were removed. The present data suggest that a more oxidized redox state and a lower antioxidant GSH defense can be dissociated from neuronal ROS damage, changes that precede the onset of cognitive deficits in the 3xTg-AD model.

22539855|t|Impaired short-term plasticity in mossy fiber synapses caused by mitochondrial dysfunction of dentate granule cells is the earliest synaptic deficit in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
22539855|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the early stages is characterized by memory impairment, which may be attributable to synaptic dysfunction. Oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and Ca2+ dysregulation are key factors in the pathogenesis of AD, but the causal relationship between these factors and synaptic dysfunction is not clearly understood. We found that in the hippocampus of an AD mouse model (Tg2576), mitochondrial Ca2+ handling in dentate granule cells was impaired as early as the second postnatal month, and this Ca2+ dysregulation caused an impairment of post-tetanic potentiation in mossy fiber-CA3 synapses. The alteration of cellular Ca2+ clearance in Tg2576 mice is region-specific within hippocampus because in another region, CA1 pyramidal neuron, no significant difference in Ca2+ clearance was detected between wild-type and Tg2576 mice at this early stage. Impairment of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake was associated with increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential. Mitochondrial dysfunctions in dentate granule cells and impairment of post-tetanic potentiation in mossy fiber-CA3 synapses were fully restored when brain slices obtained from Tg2576 were pretreated with antioxidant, suggesting that mitochondrial oxidative stress initiates other dysfunctions. Reversibility of early dysfunctions by antioxidants at the preclinical stage of AD highlights the importance of early diagnosis and antioxidant therapy to delay or prevent the disease processes.

22541439|t|Inhibitory interneuron deficit links altered network activity and cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer model.
22541439|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) results in cognitive decline and altered network activity, but the mechanisms are unknown. We studied human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) transgenic mice, which simulate key aspects of AD. Electroencephalographic recordings in hAPP mice revealed spontaneous epileptiform discharges, indicating network hypersynchrony, primarily during reduced gamma oscillatory activity. Because this oscillatory rhythm is generated by inhibitory parvalbumin (PV) cells, network dysfunction in hAPP mice might arise from impaired PV cells. Supporting this hypothesis, hAPP mice and AD patients had decreased levels of the interneuron-specific and PV cell-predominant voltage-gated sodium channel subunit Nav1.1. Restoring Nav1.1 levels in hAPP mice by Nav1.1-BAC expression increased inhibitory synaptic activity and gamma oscillations and reduced hypersynchrony, memory deficits, and premature mortality. We conclude that reduced Nav1.1 levels and PV cell dysfunction critically contribute to abnormalities in oscillatory rhythms, network synchrony, and memory in hAPP mice and possibly in AD.

22542184|t|Mutant PrP suppresses glutamatergic neurotransmission in cerebellar granule neurons by impairing membrane delivery of VGCC alpha(2)delta-1 Subunit.
22542184|a|How mutant prion protein (PrP) leads to neurological dysfunction in genetic prion diseases is unknown. Tg(PG14) mice synthesize a misfolded mutant PrP which is partially retained in the neuronal endoplasmic reticulum (ER). As these mice age, they develop ataxia and massive degeneration of cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs). Here, we report that motor behavioral deficits in Tg(PG14) mice emerge before neurodegeneration and are associated with defective glutamate exocytosis from granule neurons due to impaired calcium dynamics. We found that mutant PrP interacts with the voltage-gated calcium channel alpha(2)delta-1 subunit, which promotes the anterograde trafficking of the channel. Owing to ER retention of mutant PrP, alpha(2)delta-1 accumulates intracellularly, impairing delivery of the channel complex to the cell surface. Thus, mutant PrP disrupts cerebellar glutamatergic neurotransmission by reducing the number of functional channels in CGNs. These results link intracellular PrP retention to synaptic dysfunction, indicating new modalities of neurotoxicity and potential therapeutic strategies.

22542525|t|On the possible amyloid origin of protein folds.
22542525|a|The diversity of protein folds is derived from the diversity of the underlying proteome. Such diversity must have originated from a so-called common ancestor: a hypothetical fold whose identity will, in all likelihood, never be known. Nonetheless, hypotheses exist to explain the evolution of protein folds. When formulating such hypotheses as done here, the entire repertoire of polypeptide structure, from well-defined tertiary structures and molten globule states to intrinsically disordered proteins and oligomeric aggregates, is worth considering. It is the aim of this short essay to discuss the hypothesis that one type of protein aggregate-the cross-beta-sheet motif-was the first functional protein fold, that is, the common ancestor fold. Support for this hypothesis comes from the observations that (i) short peptides with simple amino acid sequences are able to form the cross-beta-sheet structure, (ii) amyloids can be very stable under harsh conditions, (iii) amyloids can self-assemble in complex mixtures, (iv) amyloids have many potent activities that are attributable to the inherent repetitiveness of the structure, and (v) the proteomes of modern organisms appear to have evolved away from the more amyloidogenic sequences of older organisms, suggesting that amyloids were more ubiquitous earlier in the evolution of modern protein folds.

However, the consequences of chronic Cu exposure at the presence of other AD risk factors remain to be clarified. To investigate the effects of chronic Cu intake on cerebral hypoperfusion-induced AD pathology, Sprague-Dawley rats suffered bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (2VO) were administrated with 250 ppm copper-containing water or not. Morris water maze test showed that Cu exposure for 3 months exacerbated cognitive impairment induced by 2VO. Elevated amyloid precursor protein (APP) and beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) expression in mRNA and protein levels were also observed in brain of Cu-exposed rats suffered 2VO. In contrast, these Cu-exacerbated changes were ameliorated after Cu was withdrawn from drinking water. In summary, our findings demonstrate that chronic Cu exposure might exacerbate AD pathology in 2VO rats.

22542901|t|Role of hippocalcin in mediating Abeta toxicity.
22542901|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, and amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and tau-containing tangles are its histopathological hallmark lesions. These do not occur at random; rather, the neurodegenerative process is stereotyped in that it is initiated in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampal formation. Interestingly, it is the latter brain area where the calcium-sensing enzyme hippocalcin is highly expressed. Because calcium deregulation is a well-established pathomechanism in AD, we aimed to address the putative role of hippocalcin in human AD brain and transgenic mouse models. We found that hippocalcin levels are increased in human AD brain and in Abeta plaque-forming APP23 transgenic mice compared to controls. To determine the role of hippocalcin in Abeta toxicity, we treated primary cultures derived from hippocalcin knockout (HC KO) mice with Abeta and found them to be more susceptible to Abeta toxicity than controls. Likewise, treatment with either thapsigargin or ionomycin, both known to deregulate intracellular calcium levels, caused an increased toxicity in hippocampal neurons from HC KO mice compared to wild-type. We found further that mitochondrial complex I activity increased from 3 to 6months in hippocampal mitochondria from wild-type and HC KO mice, but that the latter exhibited a significantly stronger aging phenotype than wild-type. Abeta treatment induced significant toxicity on hippocampal mitochondria from HC KO mice already at 3months of age, while wild-type mitochondria were spared. Our data suggest that hippocalcin has a neuroprotective role in AD, presenting it as a putative biomarker.

22544746|t|Specific soluble oligomers of amyloid-beta peptide undergo replication and form non-fibrillar aggregates in interfacial environments.
22544746|a|Aggregates of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides have been implicated in the etiology of Alzheimer disease. Among the different forms of Abeta aggregates, low molecular weight species ranging between ~2- and 50-mers, also called "soluble oligomers," have emerged as the species responsible for early synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss. Emerging evidence suggests that the neurotoxic oligomers need not be formed along the obligatory nucleation-dependant fibril formation pathway. In our earlier work, we reported the isolation of one such "off-pathway" 12-18-mer species of Abeta42 generated from fatty acids called large fatty acid-derived oligomers (LFAOs) (Kumar, A., Bullard, R. L., Patel, P., Paslay, L. C., Singh, D., Bienkiewicz, E. A., Morgan, S. E., and Rangachari, V. (2011) PLoS One 6, e18759). Here, we report the physiochemical aspects of LFAO-monomer interactions as well as LFAO-LFAO associations in the presence of interfaces. We discovered that LFAOs are a replicating strain of oligomers that recruit Abeta42 monomers and quantitatively convert them into LFAO assemblies at the expense of fibrils, a mechanism similar to prion propagation. We also found that in the presence of hexane-buffer or chloroform-buffer interfaces LFAOs are able to associate with themselves to form larger but non-fibrillar aggregates. These results further support the hypothesis that low molecular weight oligomers can be generated via non-fibril formation pathways. Furthermore, the unique replicating property of off-pathway oligomers may hold profound significance for Alzheimer disease pathology.

22545704|t|Protonation states of the catalytic dyad of beta-secretase (BACE1) in the presence of chemically diverse inhibitors: a molecular docking study.
22545704|a|In this molecular docking study, the protonation states of the catalytic Asp dyad of the beta-secretase (BACE1) enzyme in the presence of eight chemically diverse inhibitors have been predicted. BACE1 catalyzes the rate-determining step in the generation of Alzheimer amyloid beta peptides and is widely considered as a promising therapeutic target. All the inhibitors were redocked into their corresponding X-ray structures using a combination of eight different protonation states of the Asp dyad for each inhibitor. Five inhibitors were primarily found to favor two different monoprotonated states, and the remaining three favor a dideprotonated state. In addition, five of them exhibited secondary preference for a diprotonated state. These results show that the knowledge of a single protonation state of the Asp dyad is not sufficient to search for the novel inhibitors of BACE1 and the most plausible state for each inhibitor must be determined prior to conducting in-silico screening.

22545812|t|Alzheimer's disease amyloid beta-protein mutations and deletions that define neuronal binding/internalization as early stage nonfibrillar/fibrillar aggregates and late stage fibrils.
22545812|a|Accumulation of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) in neurons has been demonstrated to precede its formation as amyloid plaques in the extracellular space in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Consequently, intraneuronal Abeta accumulation is thought to be a critical first step in the fatal cascade of events that leads to neuronal degeneration in AD. Understanding the structural basis of neuronal binding and uptake of Abeta might lead to potential therapeutic targets that could block this binding and the subsequent neurodegeneration that leads to the pathogenesis of AD. Previously, we demonstrated that mutation of the two adjacent histidine residues of Abeta40 (H13,14G) resulted in a significant decrease in its level of binding to PC12 cells and mouse cortical/hippocampal neurons. We now demonstrate that the weakened neuronal binding follows the mutation order of H13G < H14G < H13,14G, which suggests that the primary domain for neuronal binding of Abeta40 involves histidine at position 13. A novel APP mutation (E693Delta) that produced a variant Abeta lacking glutamate 22 (E22Delta) in Japanese pedigrees was recently identified to have AD-type dementia without amyloid plaque formation but with extensive intraneuronal Abeta in transfected cells and transgenic mice expressing this deletion. Deletion of glutamate 22 of Abeta40 resulted in a 6-fold enhancement of PC12 neuronal binding that was not decreased by the H13G mutation. The dose-dependent enhanced binding of E22Delta explains the high level of intraneuronal Abeta seen in this pedigree. Fluorescence anisotropy experiments at room temperature showed very rapid aggregation with increased tyrosine rigidity of Abeta39E22Delta, Abeta41E22Delta, and Abeta42 but not Abeta40. This rigidity was decreased but not eliminated by prior treatment with dimethyl sulfoxide. Surprisingly, all peptides showed an aggregated state when evaluated by transmission electron microscopy, with Abeta39E22Delta having early stage fibrils, which was also verified by atomic force microscopy. This aggregation was not affected by centrifugation or pretreatment with organic solvents. The enhanced neuronal binding of Abeta, therefore, results from aggregate binding to neurons, which requires H13 for Abeta40 but not for E22Delta or Abeta42. These latter proteins display increased tyrosine rigidity that likely masks the H13 residue, or alternatively, the H13 residue is not required for neuronal binding of these proteins as it is for Abeta40. Late state fibrils also showed enhanced neuronal binding for E22Delta but not Abeta40 with subsequent intraneuronal accumulation in lysosomes. This suggests that there are multiple pathways of binding/internalization for the different Abeta proteins and their aggregation states or fibrillar structure.

22546279|t|Examining the mechanisms that link beta-amyloid and alpha-synuclein pathologies.
22546279|a|beta-amyloid (Abeta) and alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) are aggregation-prone proteins typically associated with two distinct neurodegenerative disorders: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease. Yet alpha-syn was first found in association with AD plaques several years before being linked to Parkinson's disease or Lewy body formation. Nowadays, a large subset of AD patients (~50%) is well recognized to co-exhibit significant alpha-syn Lewy body pathology. Unfortunately, these AD Lewy body variant patients suffer from additional symptoms and an accelerated disease course. Basic research has begun to show that Abeta and alpha-syn may act synergistically to promote the aggregation and accumulation of each other. While the exact mechanisms by which these proteins interact remain unclear, growing evidence suggests that Abeta may drive alpha-syn pathology by impairing protein clearance, activating inflammation, enhancing phosphorylation, or directly promoting aggregation. This review examines the interactions between Abeta and alpha-syn and proposes potential mechanistic links between Abeta accumulation and alpha-syn pathogenesis.

22547072|t|Conformational differences between two amyloid beta oligomers of similar size and dissimilar toxicity.
22547072|a|Several protein conformational disorders (Parkinson and prion diseases) are linked to aberrant folding of proteins into prefibrillar oligomers and amyloid fibrils. Although prefibrillar oligomers are more toxic than their fibrillar counterparts, it is difficult to decouple the origin of their dissimilar toxicity because oligomers and fibrils differ both in terms of structure and size. Here we report the characterization of two oligomers of the 42-residue amyloid beta (Abeta42) peptide associated with Alzheimer disease that possess similar size and dissimilar toxicity. We find that Abeta42 spontaneously forms prefibrillar oligomers at Abeta concentrations below 30 mum in the absence of agitation, whereas higher Abeta concentrations lead to rapid formation of fibrils. Interestingly, Abeta prefibrillar oligomers do not convert into fibrils under quiescent assembly conditions but instead convert into a second type of oligomer with size and morphology similar to those of Abeta prefibrillar oligomers. Strikingly, this alternative Abeta oligomer is non-toxic to mammalian cells relative to Abeta monomer. We find that two hydrophobic peptide segments within Abeta (residues 16-22 and 30-42) are more solvent-exposed in the more toxic Abeta oligomer. The less toxic oligomer is devoid of beta-sheet structure, insoluble, and non-immunoreactive with oligomer- and fibril-specific antibodies. Moreover, the less toxic oligomer is incapable of disrupting lipid bilayers, in contrast to its more toxic oligomeric counterpart. Our results suggest that the ability of non-fibrillar Abeta oligomers to interact with and disrupt cellular membranes is linked to the degree of solvent exposure of their central and C-terminal hydrophobic peptide segments.

22547798|t|Toxic fibrillar oligomers of amyloid-beta have cross-beta structure.
22547798|a|Although amyloid fibers are found in neurodegenerative diseases, evidence points to soluble oligomers of amyloid-forming proteins as the cytotoxic species. Here, we establish that our preparation of toxic amyloid-beta(1-42) (Abeta42) fibrillar oligomers (TABFOs) shares with mature amyloid fibrils the cross-beta structure, in which adjacent beta-sheets adhere by interpenetration of protein side chains. We study the structure and properties of TABFOs by powder X-ray diffraction, EM, circular dichroism, FTIR spectroscopy, chromatography, conformational antibodies, and celluar toxicity. In TABFOs, Abeta42 molecules stack into short protofilaments consisting of pairs of helical beta-sheets that wrap around each other to form a superhelix. Wrapping results in a hole along the superhelix axis, providing insight into how Abeta may form pathogenic amyloid pores. Our model is consistent with numerous properties of Abeta42 fibrillar oligomers, including heterogenous size, ability to seed new populations of fibrillar oligomers, and fiber-like morphology.

22551351|t|Structural dynamics of the amyloid beta-protein monomer folding nucleus.
22551351|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is linked to the aberrant assembly of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta). The (21)AEDVGSNKGA(30) segment, Abeta(21-30), forms a turn that acts as a monomer folding nucleus. Amino acid substitutions within this nucleus cause familial forms of AD. To determine the biophysical characteristics of the folding nucleus, we studied the biologically relevant acetyl-Abeta(21-30)-amide peptide using experimental techniques (limited proteolysis, thermal denaturation, urea denaturation followed by pulse proteolysis, and electron microscopy) and computational methods (molecular dynamics). Our results reveal a highly stable foldon and suggest new strategies for therapeutic drug development.

22551668|t|Cholesterol-depletion corrects APP and BACE1 misstrafficking in NPC1-deficient cells.
22551668|a|Cholesterol accumulation in Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC) causes increased levels of the amyloid-precursor-protein C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) and intracellular amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), the two central molecules in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. We previously reported that cholesterol accumulation in NPC-cells leads to cholesterol-dependent increased APP processing by beta-secretase (BACE1) and decreased APP expression at the cell surface (Malnar et al. Biochim Biophys Acta. 1802 (2010) 682-691.). We hypothesized that increased formation of APP-CTFs and Abeta in NPC disease is due to cholesterol-mediated altered endocytic trafficking of APP and/or BACE1. Here, we show that APP endocytosis is prerequisite for enhanced Abeta levels in NPC-cells. Moreover, we observed that NPC cells show cholesterol dependent sequestration and colocalization of APP and BACE1 within enlarged early/recycling endosomes which can lead to increased beta-secretase processing of APP. We demonstrated that increased endocytic localization of APP in NPC-cells is likely due to both its increased internalization and its decreased recycling to the cell surface. Our findings suggest that increased cholesterol levels, such as in NPC disease and sporadic AD, may be the upstream effector that drives amyloidogenic APP processing characteristic for Alzheimer's disease by altering endocytic trafficking of APP and BACE1.

22551728|t|Nutrient intake and plasma beta-amyloid.
22551728|a|OBJECTIVE: The widely reported associations between various nutrients and cognition may occur through many biologic pathways including those of beta-amyloid (Abeta). However, little is known about the possible associations of dietary factors with plasma Abeta40 or Abeta42. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the association between nutrient intake and plasma Abeta levels. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, plasma Abeta40 and Abeta42 and dietary data were obtained from 1,219 cognitively healthy elderly (age >65 years), who were participants in a community-based multiethnic cohort. Information on dietary intake was obtained 1.2 years, on average, before Abeta assay. The associations of plasma Abeta40 and Abeta42 levels and dietary intake of 10 nutrients were examined using linear regression models, adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity, education, caloric intake, apolipoprotein E genotype, and recruitment wave. Nutrients examined included saturated fatty acid, monounsaturated fatty acid, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), omega-6 PUFA, vitamin E, vitamin C, beta-carotene, vitamin B(12), folate, and vitamin D. RESULTS: In unadjusted models that simultaneously included all nutrients, higher intake of omega-3 PUFA was associated with lower levels of Abeta40 (beta = -24.7, p < 0.001) and lower levels of Abeta42 (beta = -12.3, p < 0.001). In adjusted models, omega-3 PUFA remained a strong predictor of Abeta42 (beta = -7.31, p = 0.02), whereas its association with Abeta40 was attenuated (beta = -11.96, p = 0.06). Other nutrients were not associated with plasma Abeta levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that higher dietary intake of omega-3 PUFA is associated with lower plasma levels of Abeta42, a profile linked with reduced risk of incident AD and slower cognitive decline in our cohort.

22551949|t|Protective effects of diazoxide against Abeta25-35-induced PC12 cell apoptosis due to prevention of endoplasmic reticulum stress.
22551949|a|Accumulated amyloid-beta (Abeta) is a well-known cause of neuronal apoptosis in Alzheimer's disease and exerts its action partly by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction. Previous studies have suggested a neuroprotective role for mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel openers against Abeta damages, but the molecular details were unclear. Recent evidence indicates that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress also plays an important role in the process of cell apoptosis. It remains to be determined whether KATP channel openers mediate their potential neuroprotective role by inhibiting ER stress pathways. The mRNA and protein expression levels of caspase-12, an ER-specific caspase, were observed. Here we showed that in response to the treatment with Abeta25-35 (10 muM) for 24 h the mRNA and protein expression levels of caspase-12 were significantly upregulated; however, this change could be partly reversed by pretreatment with diazoxide (1 mM) for 1 h. This effect was negated by 5-hydroxydecanoate, a selective mitochondrial KATP channel blocker. Our results indicate that the cytoprotective efficacy of diazoxide under Abeta25-35-induced insults is mediated, at least in part, by inhibition of ER stress. Demonstration of the neuroprotective action of diazoxide provides additional insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of Abeta25-35 toxicity and defines possible molecular targets for therapeutic intervention.

22552354|t|The chalcone derivative Chana 1 protects against amyloid beta peptide-induced oxidative stress and cognitive impairment.
22552354|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease to cause dementia in the elderly. Amyloid beta (Abeta)-peptide induced oxidative stress causes the initiation and progression of AD. Recently, new chalcone derivatives termed the Chana series were synthesized. Among them, Chana 1 showed high free radical scavenging activity (72.5%), as measured by a DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) assay. In this study, we investigated the effect of Chana 1 against Abeta-induced cytotoxicity and cognitive deficits. Additionally, we sought to estimate the lethal dose, 50% (LD50) of Chana 1 in mice using an acute oral toxicity test. We found that Chana 1 significantly protected against Abeta-induced neuronal cell death in PC12 cells. Oral administration of Chana 1 at a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight/day significantly improved Abeta-induced learning and memory impairment in mice, as measured in Y-maze and passive avoidance tests. In acute toxicity tests, the LD50 in mice was determined to be 520.44 mg/kg body weight. The data are valuable for future studies and suggest that Chana 1 has therapeutic potential for the management of neurodegenerative disease.

22552903|t|Development and advanced validation of an optimized method for the quantitation of Abeta42 in human cerebrospinal fluid.
22552903|a|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers have been extensively utilized in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and characterization of progression. One important CSF biomarker is the amyloid beta 42 (Abeta(42)) peptide, a key player in AD pathogenesis. The INNOTEST  Abeta(42) ELISA kit has been widely used but an advanced level of method development and validation has not been reported. To support a clinical trial in AD, we successfully completed a Good Laboratory Practices (GLP)-level validation of the method to establish the parameters of precision, accuracy, parallelism, selectivity, specificity, and linearity of dilution of the assay in CSF matrix, as well as CSF storage stability. Several modifications were required to optimize the assay and ensure consistent results in a clinical-trial setting. These included the use of additional calibrators, an adjusted standard curve range, a minimum required dilution (MRD) of CSF by 6-fold to avoid matrix interference and mitigation of analyte adsorption to labware by the addition of Tween-20. The optimized method displayed a quantitative range of 375-4,500 pg/mL. The inter-assay precision was <=12.1 % CV and the inter-assay relative accuracy was <=10.9 % absolute bias, bringing the total error of the assay to <=23 %. The intra-assay precision of the assay at the high validation standard and below was <=5.5 % CV; this enables sensitive detection of biomarker changes across a therapeutic regime. The INNOTEST  Abeta(42) ELISA kit, modified as reported here, may be appropriate for many applications, including regulatory agency acceptable clinical diagnosis and pharmacodynamic assessment.

22553349|t|Adaptor protein 2-mediated endocytosis of the beta-secretase BACE1 is dispensable for amyloid precursor protein processing.
22553349|a|The beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP)-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is a transmembrane aspartyl protease that catalyzes the proteolytic processing of APP and other plasma membrane protein precursors. BACE1 cycles between the trans-Golgi network (TGN), the plasma membrane, and endosomes by virtue of signals contained within its cytosolic C-terminal domain. One of these signals is the DXXLL-motif sequence DISLL, which controls transport between the TGN and endosomes via interaction with GGA proteins. Here we show that the DISLL sequence is embedded within a longer [DE]XXXL[LI]-motif sequence, DDISLL, which mediates internalization from the plasma membrane by interaction with the clathrin-associated, heterotetrameric adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) complex. Mutation of this signal or knockdown of either AP-2 or clathrin decreases endosomal localization and increases plasma membrane localization of BACE1. Remarkably, internalization-defective BACE1 is able to cleave an APP mutant that itself cannot be delivered to endosomes. The drug brefeldin A reversibly prevents BACE1-catalyzed APP cleavage, ruling out that this reaction occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or ER-Golgi intermediate compartment. Taken together, these observations support the notion that BACE1 is capable of cleaving APP in late compartments of the secretory pathway.

22553492|t|The clinical problem of symptomatic Alzheimer disease and mild cognitive impairment.
22553492|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. Clinicopathological studies support the presence of a long preclinical phase of the disease, with the initial deposition of AD pathology estimated to begin approximately 10-15 years prior to the onset of clinical symptoms. The hallmark clinical phenotype of AD is a gradual and progressive decline in two or more cognitive domains, most commonly involving episodic memory and executive functions, that is sufficient to cause social or occupational impairment. Current diagnostic criteria can accurately identify AD in the majority of cases. As disease-modifying therapies are being developed, there is growing interest in the identification of individuals in the earliest symptomatic, as well as presymptomatic, stages of disease, because it is in this population that such therapies may have the greatest chance of success. The use of informant-based methods to establish cognitive and functional decline of an individual from previously attained levels of performance best allows for the identification of individuals in the very mildest stages of cognitive impairment.

22553493|t|Trafficking and proteolytic processing of APP.
22553493|a|Accumulations of insoluble deposits of amyloid beta-peptide are major pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease. Amyloid beta-peptide is derived by sequential proteolytic processing from a large type I trans-membrane protein, the beta-amyloid precursor protein. The proteolytic enzymes involved in its processing are named secretases. beta- and gamma-secretase liberate by sequential cleavage the neurotoxic amyloid beta-peptide, whereas alpha-secretase prevents its generation by cleaving within the middle of the amyloid domain. In this chapter we describe the cell biological and biochemical characteristics of the three secretase activities involved in the proteolytic processing of the precursor protein. In addition we outline how the precursor protein maturates and traffics through the secretory pathway to reach the subcellular locations where the individual secretases are preferentially active. Furthermore, we illuminate how neuronal activity and mutations which cause familial Alzheimer disease affect amyloid beta-peptide generation and therefore disease onset and progression.

22554145|t|Specific binding of a beta-cyclodextrin dimer to the amyloid beta peptide modulates the peptide aggregation process.
22554145|a|Alzheimer's disease involves progressive neuronal loss. Linked to the disease is the amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide, a 38-43-amino acid peptide found in extracellular amyloid plaques in the brain. Cyclodextrins are nontoxic, cone-shaped oligosaccharides with a hydrophilic exterior and a hydrophobic cavity making them suitable hosts for aromatic guest molecules in water. beta-Cyclodextrin consists of seven alpha-d-glucopyranoside units and has been shown to reduce the level of fibrillation and neurotoxicity of Abeta. We have studied the interaction between Abeta and a beta-cyclodextrin dimer, consisting of two beta-cyclodextrin monomers connected by a flexible linker. The beta-cyclodextrin monomer has been found to interact with Abeta(1-40) at sites Y10, F19, and/or F20 with a dissociation constant (K(D)) of 3.9 +- 2.0 mM. Here (1)H-(15)N and (1)H-(13)C heteronuclear single-quantum correlation nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra show that in addition, the beta-cyclodextrin monomer and dimer bind to the histidines. NMR translational diffusion experiments reveal the increased affinity of the beta-cyclodextrin dimer (apparent K(D) of 1.1 +- 0.5 mM) for Abeta(1-40) compared to that of the beta-cyclodextrin monomer. Kinetic aggregation experiments based on thioflavin T fluorescence indicate that the dimer at 0.05-5 mM decreases the lag time of Abeta aggregation, while a concentration of 10 mM increases the lag time. The beta-cyclodextrin monomer at a high concentration decreases the lag time of the aggregation. We conclude that cyclodextrin monomers and dimers have specific, modulating effects on the Abeta(1-40) aggregation process. Transmission electron microscopy shows that the regular fibrillar aggregates formed by Abeta(1-40) alone are replaced by a major fraction of amorphous aggregates in the presence of the beta-cyclodextrin dimer.

22555375|t|Amyloid-beta secretion, generation, and lysosomal sequestration in response to proteasome inhibition: involvement of autophagy.
22555375|a|The proteasome is important for degradation of worn out and misfolded proteins. Decreased proteasome activity has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Proteasome inhibition induces autophagy, but it is still unknown whether autophagy is beneficial or deleterious to AD neurons, as the autophagosome has been suggested as a site of amyloid-beta (Abeta) generation. In this study, we investigated the effect of proteasome inhibition on Abeta accumulation and secretion, as well as the processing of amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) in AbetaPP(Swe) transfected SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. We show that proteasome inhibition resulted in autophagy-dependent accumulation of Abeta in lysosomes, and increased levels of intracellular and secreted Abeta. The enhanced levels of Abeta could not be explained by increased amounts of AbetaPP. Instead, reduced degradation of the C-terminal fragment of AbetaPP (C99) by the proteasome makes C99 available for gamma-secretase cleavage, leading to Abeta generation. Inhibition of autophagy after proteasome inhibition led to reduced levels of intracellular, but not secreted Abeta, and tended to further increase the C99 to AbetaPP ratio, supporting involvement of the autophagosome in Abeta generation. Furthermore, proteasome inhibition caused a reduction in cellular viability, which was reverted by inhibition of autophagy. Dysfunction of the proteasome could cause lysosomal accumulation of Abeta, as well as increased generation and secretion of Abeta, which is partly facilitated by autophagy. As a decrease in cellular viability was also detected, it is possible that upregulation of autophagy is an unsuccessful rescue mechanism, which instead of being protective, contributes to AD pathogenesis.

22556189|t|Amyloid burden and metabolic function in early-onset Alzheimer's disease: parietal lobe involvement.
22556189|a|Alzheimer's disease with early onset often presents with a distinct cognitive profile, potentially reflecting a different distribution of underlying neuropathology. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between age and both in vivo fibrillary amyloid deposition and glucose metabolism in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Dynamic [(11)C]Pittsburgh compound-B (90 min) and static [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (15 min) scans were obtained in 100 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 20 healthy controls. Parametric non-displaceable binding potential images of [(11)C]Pittsburgh compound-B and standardized uptake value ratio images of [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose were generated using cerebellar grey matter as reference tissue. Nine [(11)C]Pittsburgh compound-B-negative patients were excluded. The remaining patients were categorized into younger (n=45, age: 56 +- 4 years) and older (n=46, age: 69 +- 5 years) groups, based on the median age (62 years) at time of diagnosis. Younger patients showed more severe impairment on visuo-spatial function, attention and executive function composite scores (P<0.05), while we found a trend towards poorer memory performance for older patients (P=0.11). Differences between groups were assessed using a general linear model with repeated measures (gender adjusted) with age as between subjects factor, region (frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital and posterior cingulate cortices) as within subjects factor and [(11)C]Pittsburgh compound-B binding/[(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose uptake as dependent variables. There was no main effect of age for [(11)C]Pittsburgh compound-B or [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose, suggesting that overall, the extent of amyloid deposition or glucose hypometabolism did not differ between groups. Regional distributions of [(11)C]Pittsburgh compound-B binding and [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose uptake (both P for interaction <0.05) differed between groups, however, largely due to increased [(11)C]Pittsburgh compound-B binding and decreased [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the parietal cortex of younger patients (both P<0.05). Linear regression analyses showed negative associations between visuo-spatial functioning and parietal [(11)C]Pittsburgh compound-B binding for younger patients (standardized beta: -0.37) and between visuo-spatial functioning and occipital binding for older patients (standardized beta: -0.39). For [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose, associations were found between parietal uptake with visuo-spatial (standardized beta: 0.55), attention (standardized beta: 0.39) and executive functioning (standardized beta: 0.37) in younger patients, and between posterior cingulate uptake and memory in older patients (standardized beta: 0.41, all P<0.05). These in vivo findings suggest that clinical differences between younger and older patients with Alzheimer's disease are not restricted to topographical differentiation in downstream processes but may originate from distinctive distributions of early upstream events. As such, increased amyloid burden, together with metabolic dysfunction, in the parietal lobe of younger patients with Alzheimer's disease may contribute to the distinct cognitive profile in these patients.

22559202|t|Label-free quantitative LC-MS proteomics of Alzheimer's disease and normally aged human brains.
22559202|a|Quantitative proteomics analysis of cortical samples of 10 Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains versus 10 normally aged brains was performed by following the accurate mass and time tag (AMT) approach with the high resolution LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer. More than 1400 proteins were identified and quantitated. A conservative approach of selecting only the consensus results of four normalization methods was suggested and used. A total of 197 proteins were shown to be significantly differentially abundant (p-values <0.05, corrected for multiplicity of testing) in AD versus control brain samples. Thirty-seven of these proteins were reported as differentially abundant or modified in AD in previous proteomics and transcriptomics publications. The rest to the best of our knowledge are new. Mapping of the discovered proteins with bioinformatic tools revealed significant enrichment with differentially abundant proteins of pathways and processes known to be important in AD, including signal transduction, regulation of protein phosphorylation, immune response, cytoskeleton organization, lipid metabolism, energy production, and cell death.

22560596|t|Stromal cell-derived factor 1alpha decreases beta-amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's disease mouse model.
22560596|a|beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregates are known to induce neuronal and synaptic dysfunction, and thus are involved in learning and memory deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD), making Abeta deposits a potential target for prevention or treatment. Microglia, especially bone marrow-derived microglia (BMDM), has been recently thought to play important roles in internalizing and phagocytozing Abeta. BMDM originate in the bone marrow, migrate into the blood as hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) and enter the brain in a chemokine-dependent manner. An effective chemoattractant for HPCs is stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), which is also involved in regulating HPCs differentiation. Therefore, we hypothesize that SDF-1 might have influence on the migration of BMDM from peripheral cycle to brain. To explore whether treatment with SDF-1alpha can decrease Abeta burden, APP/PS1 double transgenic mice were given intracerebroventricular injection of SDF-1alpha weekly from the age of 28 to 32 weeks (4 weeks of injections) or from 28 to 36 weeks (8 weeks of injections). The results of our study showed that SDF-1alpha treatment decreased the area and the number of Abeta deposits, increased the level of Iba-1, a marker of microglia, and increased the number of plaque associated microglia in the parenchyma of APP/PS1 transgenic mice. These results suggest that SDF-1 could provide a novel and promising target for the purpose of lowering Abeta pathology in AD.

22561032|t|The newly identified K+ channel blocker talatisamine attenuates beta-amyloid oligomers induced neurotoxicity in cultured cortical neurons.
22561032|a|Loss of cytosolic K(+) through up-regulated delayed rectifier K(+) channels play an important role in beta-amyloid (Abeta) induced neurotoxicity. Potent K(+) channel blocker, particular specific for I(K) channels has been suggested as an attractive candidate for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Talatisamine is a novel I(K) channel blocker discovered by virtual screening and electrophysiological characterization. In the present study, we examined the neuroprotective effect of talatisamine against Abeta oligomers induced cytotoxicity in primarily cultured cortical neurons. The neurotoxicity related to K(+) loss caused by Abeta40 oligomers included enhanced I(K) density, increased cell membrane permeability, reduced cell viability, and impaired mitochondrial transmembrane potential. Decreased Bcl-2 and increased Bax level, activation of Caspase-3 and Caspase-9 were also observed after Abeta40 oligomers incubation. Talatisamine (120 muM) and TEA (5mM) inhibited the enhanced I(K) caused by Abeta40 oligomers, attenuated cytotoxicity of Abeta oligomers by restoring cell viability and suppressing K(+) loss related apoptotic response. Our results suggested that talatisamine may become a leading compound as I(K) channel blocker for neuroprotection.

22561406|t|The protective effects of tanshinone IIA on neurotoxicity induced by beta-amyloid protein through calpain and the p35/Cdk5 pathway in primary cortical neurons.
22561406|a|The characteristic pathological change of Alzheimer's disease (AD) include deposits of beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) in brain, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), as well as a few neuronal loss. Evidence shows that Abeta causes calcium influx and induces the cleavage of p35 into p25. Furthermore, the binding of p25 to cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) constitutively activates Cdk5. The p25/Cdk5 complex then hyperphosphorylates tau. Tanshinone IIA (tanIIA), a natural product extracted from Chinese herbal medicine Salvia miltiorrhiza BUNGE, has been reported to exert antioxidative activity. However, its neuroprotective activity remains unclear. The present study determined whether tanIIA protects neurons against Abeta(25-35)-induced cytotoxicity and detected the association of this protective effect with calpain and the p35/Cdk5 pathway. The results showed that tanIIA protected neurons against the neurotoxicity of Abeta(25-35), increased the viability of neurons, decreased expression of phosphorylated tau in neurons induced by Abeta(25-35), improved the impairment of the cell ultrastructure (such as nuclear condensation and fragmentation, and neurofibril collapse). Further more, we found that tanIIA maintained the normal expression of p35 on peripheral membranes, and decreased p25 expression in the cytoplasm. TanIIA also inhibited the translocation of Cdk5 from the nucleus into the cytoplasm of primary neurons induced by Abeta(25-35). These data suggested that tanIIA possessed neuroprotective action and the protection may involve in calpain and the p35/Cdk5 pathway.

22561904|t|Inhibitory effect of curcumin on the Al(III)-induced Abeta42 aggregation and neurotoxicity in vitro.
22561904|a|The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves a key event which changes the morphology of amyloid-beta 42 (Abeta)42 peptide from its soluble monomeric form into the fibrillated aggregates in the brain. Aluminum ion, Al(III), is known to act as a pathological chaperone of the Abeta42 in this process; curcumin, a natural phenolic compound, is considered capable of binding Al(III) and Abeta42; nevertheless, little is known about the combined action of curcumin and Al(III) on the Abeta42 fibrillation and neurotoxicity. Here, combinations of circular dichroism spectroscopy, thioflavin T fluorescence, atomic force microscopy, Bradford and MTT assays, it is demonstrated that although Al(III) can promote the Abeta42 fibrillation dose-dependently, leading to the high neurotoxicity to PC12 cells, curcumin can inhibit the events. Besides, we found that curcumin is able not only to inhibit the formation of Al(III)-induced Abeta42 fibrillation, but also to form the Al(III)-curcumin complexes which in turn can remold the preformed, mature, ordered Abeta42 fibrils into the low toxic amorphous aggregates. These findings suggest that curcumin could block the binding of Al(III) with Abeta42 and form the Al(III)-curcumin complexes, so as to inhibit the Al(III)-induced Abeta42 fibrillation and neurotoxicity. The Al(III)-curcumin complexes are worth potentially developing as a therapy agent against the neurodegenerative disorders in the future.

22563077|t|Exercise is more effective than diet control in preventing high fat diet-induced beta-amyloid deposition and memory deficit in amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice.
22563077|a|Accumulating evidence suggests that some dietary patterns, specifically high fat diet (HFD), increase the risk of developing sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD). Thus, interventions targeting HFD-induced metabolic dysfunctions may be effective in preventing the development of AD. We previously demonstrated that amyloid precursor protein (APP)-overexpressing transgenic mice fed HFD showed worsening of cognitive function when compared with control APP mice on normal diet. Moreover, we reported that voluntary exercise ameliorates HFD-induced memory impairment and beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition. In the present study, we conducted diet control to ameliorate the metabolic abnormality caused by HFD on APP transgenic mice and compared the effect of diet control on cognitive function with that of voluntary exercise as well as that of combined (diet control plus exercise) treatment. Surprisingly, we found that exercise was more effective than diet control, although both exercise and diet control ameliorated HFD-induced memory deficit and Abeta deposition. The production of Abeta was not different between the exercise- and the diet control-treated mice. On the other hand, exercise specifically strengthened the activity of neprilysin, the Abeta-degrading enzyme, the level of which was significantly correlated with that of deposited Abeta in our mice. Notably, the effect of the combination treatment (exercise and diet control) on memory and amyloid pathology was not significantly different from that of exercise alone. These studies provide solid evidence that exercise is a useful intervention to rescue HFD-induced aggravation of cognitive decline in transgenic model mice of AD.

22564527|t|Loss of thioredoxin function in retinas of mice overexpressing amyloid beta.
22564527|a|Amyloid beta peptides (Abeta) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) and glaucoma. In this study, retinas of mice overexpressing Abeta (Tg) were compared to those of wild-type mice (Wt) and analyzed for oxidative stress parameters. We observed a progressive decrease in all retinal cell layers, which was significantly greater in Tg mice at 14 months and culminated in loss of the outer retina at 18 months of age. We also observed higher levels of reactive oxygen species, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and hydroperoxide in Tg versus Wt mice (14 months). These effects were associated with phosphorylation/activation of the apoptosis signal kinase 1 and the p38 mitogen-activated kinase. Western blotting analysis revealed progressive increases in the levels of thioredoxin 1 and thioredoxin inhibitory protein in Tg compared to Wt mice. No changes were observed in the levels of thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1); however, measurements of TrxR1 activity showed a 42.7+-8% reduction in Tg mice versus Wt at 14 months of age. Our data suggest that Abeta-mediated retinal neurotoxicity involves impairment of the thioredoxin system and enhanced oxidative stress, potentially implicating this mechanism in the pathogenesis of ARMD and glaucoma.

22565051|t|Evaluation of sialic acid-analogs for the attenuation of amyloid-beta toxicity.
22565051|a|BACKGROUND: Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is the main constituent of senile plaques and is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To that end, agents which either sequester Abeta or interfere with Abeta interaction/binding to cells have been investigated as a means to reduce the pathological effects of Abeta. METHODS: Different structural analogs of sialic acid (N-acetylneuramic acid) were used to decorate a chitosan backbone using EDC chemistry. FTIR and colorimetric assays were used to characterize the complexes. The ability of these complexes to attenuate Abeta toxicity was investigated in vitro using a model neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y. RESULTS: Oxygen substitution in ring structure is responsible for the increase in toxicity and increase in protective properties of the complexes. Also, the multi OH tail present in sialic acid is critical to attenuate toxicity. Analogs show no protective properties which reinforces the conclusion that clustering of sugars in cellular membranes play a significant role in Abeta binding. CONCLUSIONS: Successfully produced compounds that showed varying degree of efficacy in attenuating Abeta toxicity to cells in culture. This work elucidates the impact that certain structures of sialic acid and its analogs can have on Abeta binding. It will allow for more specific and detailed improvements in the therapeutic polysaccharide structures that can be developed and modified to overcome other shortcomings of AD therapeutic development, particularly of penetrating the blood-brain barrier. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Oxygen atom plays crucial role on therapeutic effectiveness. This work can help as a general guideline for further therapeutic development.

22566623|t|Mixed-lineage kinase 3 phosphorylates prolyl-isomerase Pin1 to regulate its nuclear translocation and cellular function.
22566623|a|Nuclear protein peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1-mediated prolyl isomerization is an essential and novel regulatory mechanism for protein phosphorylation. Therefore, tight regulation of Pin1 localization and catalytic activity is crucial for its normal nuclear functions. Pin1 is commonly dysregulated during oncogenesis and likely contributes to these pathologies; however, the mechanism(s) by which Pin1 catalytic activity and nuclear localization are increased is unknown. Here we demonstrate that mixed-lineage kinase 3 (MLK3), a MAP3K family member, phosphorylates Pin1 on a Ser138 site to increase its catalytic activity and nuclear translocation. This phosphorylation event drives the cell cycle and promotes cyclin D1 stability and centrosome amplification. Notably, Pin1 pSer138 is significantly up-regulated in breast tumors and is localized in the nucleus. These findings collectively suggest that the MLK3-Pin1 signaling cascade plays a critical role in regulating the cell cycle, centrosome numbers, and oncogenesis.

22568827|t|Presymptomatic alterations in energy metabolism and oxidative stress in the APP23 mouse model of Alzheimer disease.
22568827|a|Glucose hypometabolism is the earliest symptom observed in the brains of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients. In a former study, we analyzed the cortical proteome of the APP23 mouse model of AD at presymptomatic age (1 month) using a 2-D electrophoresis-based approach. Interestingly, long before amyloidosis can be observed in APP23 mice, proteins associated with energy metabolism were predominantly altered in transgenic as compared to wild-type mice indicating presymptomatic changes in energy metabolism. In the study presented here, we analyzed whether the observed changes were associated with oxidative stress and confirmed our previous findings in primary cortical neurons, which exhibited altered ADP/ATP levels if transgenic APP was expressed. Reactive oxygen species produced during energy metabolism have important roles in cell signaling and homeostasis as they modify proteins. We observed an overall up-regulation of protein oxidation status as shown by increased protein carbonylation in the cortex of presymptomatic APP23 mice. Interestingly, many carbonylated proteins, such as Vilip1 and Syntaxin were associated to synaptic plasticity. This demonstrates an important link between energy metabolism and synaptic function, which is altered in AD. In summary, we demonstrate that changes in cortical energy metabolism and increased protein oxidation precede the amyloidogenic phenotype in a mouse model for AD. These changes might contribute to synaptic failure observed in later disease stages, as synaptic transmission is particularly dependent on energy metabolism.

22569063|t|Effects of beta-amyloid accumulation on neural function during encoding across the adult lifespan.
22569063|a|Limited functional imaging evidence suggests that increased beta-amyloid deposition is associated with alterations in brain function, even in healthy older adults. However, the majority of these findings report on resting-state activity or functional connectivity in adults over age 60. Much less is known about the impact of beta-amyloid on neural activations during cognitive task performance, or the impact of amyloid in young and middle-aged adults. The current study measured beta-amyloid burden from PET imaging using (18)Florbetapir, in a large continuous age sample of highly-screened, healthy adults (N=137; aged 30-89 years). The same participants also underwent fMRI scanning, performing a memory encoding task. Using both beta-amyloid burden and age as continuous predictors of encoding activity, we report a dose-response relationship of beta-amyloid load to neural function, beyond the effects of age. Specifically, individuals with greater amyloid burden evidence less neural activation in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a region important for memory encoding, as well as reduced neural modulation in areas associated with default network activity: bilateral superior/medial frontal and lateral temporal cortex. Importantly, this reduction of both activation and suppression as a function of amyloid load was found across the lifespan, even in young- and middle-aged individuals. Moreover, this frontal and temporal amyloid-reduced activation/suppression was associated with poorer processing speed, verbal fluency, and fluid reasoning in a subgroup of individuals with elevated amyloid, suggesting that it is detrimental, rather than compensatory in nature.

22571982|t|Comparison of xMAP and ELISA assays for detecting cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease.
22571982|a|The best-studied biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are the pathologically-linked cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins amyloid-beta 42 (Abeta(1-42)), total tau (t-tau), and tau phosphorylated on amino acid 181 (p-tau(181)). Many laboratories measure these proteins using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Multiplex xMAP Luminex is a semi-automated assay platform with reduced intra-sample variance, which could facilitate its use in CLIA-approved clinical laboratories. CSF concentrations of these three biomarkers reported using xMAP technology differ from those measured by the most commonly used ELISA, confounding attempts to compare results. To develop a model for converting between xMAP and ELISA levels of the three biomarkers, we analyzed CSF samples from 140 subjects (59 AD, 30 controls, 34 with mild cognitive impairment, and 17 with Parkinson's disease, including 1 with dementia). Log-transformation of ELISA and xMAP levels made the variance constant in all three biomarkers and improved the linear regression: t-tau concentrations were highly correlated (r = 0.94); p-tau(181) concentrations by ELISA can be better predicted using both the t-tau and p-tau(181) xMAP values (r = 0.96) as compared to p-tau(181) concentrations alone (r = 0.82); correlation of Abeta(1-42) concentrations was relatively weaker but still high (r = 0.77). Among all six protein/assay combinations, xMAP Abeta(1-42) had the best accuracy for diagnostic classification (88%) between AD and control subjects. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that multiplex xMAP is an appropriate assay platform providing results that can be correlated with research-based ELISA values, facilitating the incorporation of this diagnostic biomarker into routine clinical practice.

22572706|t|Amyloid deposition after cerebral hypoperfusion: evidenced on [(18)F]AV-45 positron emission tomography.
22572706|a|Animal studies have shown that cerebral hypoperfusion may be associated with amyloid plaque accumulation. Amyloid plaque is known to be associated with dementia and [(18)F]AV-45 is a positron emission tomography (PET) ligand that binds to extracelluar plaques. We hypothesized that demented patients with cerebral hypoperfusion may have increased [(18)F]AV-45 uptake. Five demented patients with cerebral hypoperfusion due to unilateral carotid artery stenosis (CAS) were examined with [(18)F]AV-45 PET, and the results were compared with six elderly controls. The standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) of each region of interest (ROI) was created using whole cerebellum as the reference region. All subjects underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for obtaining structural information. Patients with dementia and unilateral CAS had a higher global [(18)F]AV-45 SUVR (1.34 +- 0.06) as compared with controls (1.10 +- 0.04, p=0.0043), especially over the frontal, temporal, precuneus, anterior cingulate and occipital regions. The statistical distribution maps revealed a significantly increased [(18)F]AV-45 SUVR in the medial frontal, caudate, thalamus, posterior cingulate, occipital and middle and superior temporal regions ipsilateral to the side of CAS (p<0.01). The present study found that cerebral [(18)F]AV-45 binding is increased in demented patients with CAS, and its distribution is lateralized to the CAS side, suggesting that amyloid-related dementia may occur under cerebral hypoperfusion.

22573143|t|Reduced platelet amyloid precursor protein ratio (APP ratio) predicts conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease.
22573143|a|Studies have shown that platelet APP ratio (representing the percentage of 120-130 kDa to 110 kDa isoforms of the amyloid precursor protein) is reduced in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, we sought to determine if baseline APP ratio predicts the conversion from MCI to AD dementia after 4 years of longitudinal assessment. Fifty-five older adults with varying degrees of cognitive impairment (34 with MCI and 21 with AD) were assessed at baseline and after 4 years. MCI patients were re-classified according to the conversion status upon follow-up: 25 individuals retained the diagnostic status of MCI and were considered as stable cases (MCI-MCI); conversely, in nine cases the diagnosis of dementia due to AD was ascertained. The APP ratio (APPr) was determined by the Western blot method in samples of platelets collected at baseline. We found a significant reduction of APPr in MCI patients who converted to dementia upon follow-up. These individuals had baseline APPr values similar to those of demented AD patients. The overall accuracy of APPr to identify subjects with MCI who will progress to AD was 0.74 +- 0.10, p = 0.05. The cut-off of 1.12 yielded a sensitivity of 75 % and a specificity of 75 %. Platelet APPr may be a surrogate marker of the disease process in AD, with potential implications for the assessment of abnormalities in the APP metabolism in patients with and at risk for dementia. However, diagnostic accuracy was relatively low. Therefore, studies in larger samples are needed to determine whether APPr may warrant its use as a biomarker to support the early diagnosis of AD.

22573671|t|beta-amyloid inhibits protein prenylation and induces cholesterol sequestration by impairing SREBP-2 cleavage.
22573671|a|Accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) inside brain neurons is an early and crucial event in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies in brains of AD patients and mice models of AD suggested that cholesterol homeostasis is altered in neurons that accumulate Abeta. Here we directly investigated the role of intracellular oligomeric Abeta(42) (oAbeta(42)) in neuronal cholesterol homeostasis. We report that oAbeta(42) induces cholesterol sequestration without increasing cellular cholesterol mass. Several features of AD, such as endosomal abnormalities, brain accumulation of Abeta and neurofibrillary tangles, and influence of apolipoprotein E genotype, are also present in Niemann-Pick type C, a disease characterized by impairment of intracellular cholesterol trafficking. These common features and data presented here suggest that a pathological mechanism involving abnormal cholesterol trafficking could take place in AD. Cholesterol sequestration in Abeta-treated neurons results from impairment of intracellular cholesterol trafficking secondary to inhibition of protein prenylation. oAbeta(42) reduces sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) cleavage, causing decrease of protein prenylation. Inhibition of protein prenylation represents a mechanism of oAbeta(42)-induced neuronal death. Supply of the isoprenoid geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate to oAbeta(42)-treated neurons recovers normal protein prenylation, reduces cholesterol sequestration, and prevents Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. Significant to AD, reduced levels of protein prenylation are present in the cerebral cortex of the TgCRND8 mouse model. In conclusion, we demonstrate a significant inhibitory effect of Abeta on protein prenylation and identify SREBP-2 as a target of oAbeta(42), directly linking Abeta to cholesterol homeostasis impairment.

22576872|t|An online nano-LC-ESI-FTICR-MS method for comprehensive characterization of endogenous fragments from amyloid beta and amyloid precursor protein in human and cat cerebrospinal fluid.
22576872|a|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is the precursor protein to amyloid beta (Abeta), the main constituent of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Endogenous Abeta peptides reflect the APP processing, and greater knowledge of different APP degradation pathways is important to understand the mechanism underlying AD pathology. When one analyzes longer Abeta peptides by low-energy collision-induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), mainly long b-fragments are observed, limiting the possibility to determine variations such as amino acid variants or post-translational modifications (PTMs) within the N-terminal half of the peptide. However, by using electron capture dissociation (ECD), we obtained a more comprehensive sequence coverage for several APP/Abeta peptide species, thus enabling a deeper characterization of possible variants and PTMs. Abnormal APP/Abeta processing has also been described in the lysosomal storage disease Niemann-Pick type C and the major large animal used for studying this disease is cat. By ECD MS/MS, a substitution of Asp7   Glu in cat Abeta was identified. Further, sialylated core 1 like O-glycans at Tyr10, recently discovered in human Abeta (a previously unknown glycosylation type), were identified also in cat cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). It is therefore likely that this unusual type of glycosylation is common for (at least) species belonging to the magnorder Boreoeutheria. We here describe a detailed characterization of endogenous APP/Abeta peptide species in CSF by using an online top-down MS-based method.

22577238|t|Initial clinical comparison of 18F-florbetapir and 18F-FDG PET in patients with Alzheimer disease and controls.
22577238|a|UNLABELLED: The purpose of this study was to determine how clinical interpretations of the (18)F-amyloid tracer florbetapir compares diagnostically with (18)F-FDG PET when evaluating patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) and controls. METHODS: Nineteen patients with a clinical diagnosis of AD and 21 elderly controls were evaluated with both (18)F-florbetapir and (18)F-FDG PET scans. Scans were interpreted together by 2 expert readers masked to any case information and were assessed for tracer binding patterns consistent with AD. The criteria for interpreting the (18)F-florbetapir scan as positive for AD was the presence of binding in the cortical regions relative to the cerebellum. (18)F-FDG PET scans were interpreted as positive if they displayed the classic pattern of hypometabolism in the temporoparietal regions. Scans were interpreted as either positive or negative for AD. In addition, a relative scoring system was used to assess the degree of either hypometabolism or amyloid binding in specified regions. The metabolism and amyloid binding scores for each region were compared across subjects. An overall ratio was calculated on the basis of values in regions expected to be affected by AD and those not expected to be affected. The metabolic ratio and amyloid ratio were then correlated with the mini-mental status examination (MMSE) score. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity, compared with the clinical diagnosis of AD or controls, for the (18)F-florbetapir scans were 95% and 95%, respectively, and for the (18)F-FDG scans 89% and 86%, respectively. When a comparison with MMSE scores was made, (18)F-FDG significantly correlated with MMSE when both controls and AD patients were included (r = 0.79, P < 0.0001) and in AD patients alone (r = 0.70, P = 0.001). The (18)F-florbetapir scores significantly correlated with MMSE scores only when both controls and AD patients were included (r = 0.62, P < 0.001) but not in the AD group alone (r = 0.12, P = 0.66). CONCLUSION: Overall, both scans performed well in detecting AD in patients with known clinical AD. Both scans correlated well with cognitive status as determined by MMSE when the entire cohort of controls and AD patients was evaluated. However, only the (18)F-FDG scans correlated with cognitive status when AD patients were evaluated separately.

22578456|t|Fluorescent 2-styrylpyridazin-3(2H)-one derivatives as probes targeting amyloid-beta plaques in Alzheimer's disease.
22578456|a|Amyloid plaques, which are primarily composed of aggregated amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide, are the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Fluorescent markers containing 2-styrylpyridazin-3(2H)-ones were developed to detect intracellular aggregated Abeta peptides. Nine compounds exhibited a greater than 10-fold increase of in emission spectra before and after mixing with Abeta aggregates compared with before mixing. Among these compounds, compound 9n exhibited the highest affinity for Abeta aggregates (K(d)=1.84 muM) and selectively stained both aggregated intracellular Abeta and Abeta plaques in the transgenic AD model mice (APP/PS1). These preliminary results indicate that 2-styrylpyridazin-3(2H)-one derivatives are promising alternative fluorescence imaging agent for the study of AD.

22578498|t|Reduction of hippocampal hyperactivity improves cognition in amnestic mild cognitive impairment.
22578498|a|Elevated hippocampal activation is observed in conditions that confer risk for Alzheimer's disease, including amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Studies in relevant animal models have indicated that overactivity in selective hippocampal circuits contributes to cognitive impairment. Here, we tested the effect of reducing hippocampal activation in aMCI. Under placebo treatment, hippocampal activation in the dentate gyrus/CA3 was elevated in aMCI patients compared to a healthy control group. By using a low dose of the antiepileptic levetiracetam hippocampal activation in aMCI was reduced to a level that did not differ from the control group. Compared to aMCI memory performance under placebo, performance in the scanning task was significantly improved under drug treatment. Contrary to the view that greater hippocampal activation might serve a beneficial function, these results support the view that increased hippocampal activation in aMCI is a dysfunctional condition and that targeting excess hippocampal activity has therapeutic potential.

22579683|t|Curcumin modulates the self-assembly of the islet amyloid polypeptide by disassembling alpha-helix.
22579683|a|Understanding how small molecules affect amyloid formation is of major biomedical and pharmaceutical importance due to the association of amyloid with incurable diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and type II diabetes. Using solution state (1)H NMR, we demonstrate that curcumin, a planar biphenolic compound found in the Indian spice turmeric, delays the self-assembly of islet amyloid polypeptide to NMR-invisible assemblies. Accompanying circular dichroism studies show that curcumin disassembles alpha-helix in maturing assemblies of IAPP. The amount of alpha-helix disassembled correlates with predicted and experimentally determined helical content of IAPP obtained by others. Taken together, these results indicate that curcumin modulates IAPP self-assembly by unfolding alpha-helix on pathway to amyloid. The implications of this work in the elucidation of the mechanism for amyloid formation by IAPP in the presence of curcumin are discussed.

22580042|t|NDM29, a RNA polymerase III-dependent non coding RNA, promotes amyloidogenic processing of APP and amyloid beta secretion.
22580042|a|Neuroblastoma Differentiation Marker 29 (NDM29) is a RNA polymerase (pol) III-transcribed non-coding (nc) RNA whose synthesis drives neuroblastoma (NB) cell differentiation to a nonmalignant neuron-like phenotype. Since in this process a complex pattern of molecular changes is associated to plasma membrane protein repertoire we hypothesized that the expression of NDM29 might influence also key players of neurodegenerative pathways. In this work we show that the NDM29-dependent cell maturation induces amyloid precursor protein (APP) synthesis, leading to the increase of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) secretion and the concomitant increment of Abeta x-42/Abeta x-40 ratio. We also demonstrate that the expression of NDM29 RNA, and the consequent increase of Abeta formation, can be promoted by inflammatory stimuli (and repressed by anti-inflammatory drugs). Moreover, NDM29 expression was detected in normal human brains although an abnormal increased synthesis of this ncRNA is induced in patients affected by neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, the complex of events triggered by NDM29 expression induces a condition that favors the formation of Abeta peptides in the extracellular space, as it may occur in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). In addition, these data unexpectedly show that a pol III-dependent small RNA can act as key regulator of brain physiology and/or pathology suggesting that a better knowledge of this portion of the human transcriptome might provide hints for neurodegeneration studies.

22580285|t|Utilization of a multiple antigenic peptide as a calibration standard in the BAN50 single antibody sandwich ELISA for Abeta oligomers.
22580285|a|Soluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers are thought to be a cause of neurodegeneration and memory loss in Alzheimer disease (AD). We recently reported a newly developed enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for high molecular weight (HMW) Abeta oligomers in which the same Abeta monoclonal antibody, BAN50, was used for both capture and detection in a single antibody sandwich ELISA (SAS-ELISA) system. Our previous data suggest that this assay will be useful for the early diagnosis of AD, but its practical application to large-scale or longitudinal studies has been limited because of lack of a reliable calibration standard. In order to develop such a standard, we have now constructed a novel peptide using the multiple antigenic peptide (MAP) technique, where multiple epitopes of BAN50 were linked, via a spacer, to a branching lysine core. We show that the standard curve constructed from a 16-mer MAP covered the physiological range of signals obtained in the BAN50 SAS-ELISA from samples of human CSF, serum, and plasma. Furthermore, this 16-mer MAP is available in large quantities and is stable against freeze-thawing. We estimate that the signal per 1 pM of this standard corresponds to 1.54-5.0 pM of HMW Abeta oligomers. This MAP approach could also be used to provide an effective calibration standard for other SAS-ELISAs.

22581851|t|Increased cortical and thalamic excitability in freely moving APPswe/PS1dE9 mice modeling epileptic activity associated with Alzheimer's disease.
22581851|a|Amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice modeling Alzheimer's disease display frequent occurrence of seizures peaking at an age when amyloid plaques start to form in the cortex and hippocampus. We tested the hypothesis that numerous reported interactions of amyloid-beta with cell surface molecules result in altered excitation-inhibition balance in brain-wide neural networks, eventually leading to epileptogenesis. We examined electroencephalograms (EEGs) and auditory-evoked potentials (AEPs) in freely moving 4-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 (APdE9) and wild-type (WT) control mice in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and thalamus during movement, quiet waking, non-rapid eye movement sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Cortical EEG power was higher in APdE9 mice than in WT mice over a broad frequency range (5-100 Hz) and during all 4 behavioral states. Thalamic EEG power was also increased but in a narrower range (10-80 Hz). Furthermore, APdE9 mice displayed augmented cortical and thalamic AEPs. While power and theta-gamma modulation were preserved in the APdE9 hippocampus, REM sleep-related phase shift of theta-gamma modulation was altered. Our data suggest that at the early stage of amyloid pathology, cortical principal cells become hyperexcitable and via extensive cortico-thalamic connection drive thalamic cells. Minor hippocampal changes are most likely secondary to abnormal entorhinal input.

22582169|t|Subpixel colocalization reveals amyloid precursor protein-dependent kinesin-1 and dynein association with axonal vesicles.
22582169|a|Intracellular transport of vesicles and organelles along microtubules is powered by kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein molecular motors. Both motors can attach to the same cargo and thus must be coordinated to ensure proper distribution of intracellular materials. Although a number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain how these motors are coordinated, considerable uncertainty remains, in part because of the absence of methods for assessing motor subunit composition on individual vesicular cargos. We developed a robust quantitative immunofluorescence method based on subpixel colocalization to elucidate relative kinesin-1 and cytoplasmic dynein motor subunit composition of individual, endogenous amyloid precursor protein (APP) vesicles in mouse hippocampal cells. The resulting method and data allow us to test a key in vivo prediction of the hypothesis that APP can recruit kinesin-1 to APP vesicles in neuronal axons. We found that APP levels are well-correlated with the amount of the light chain of kinesin-1 (KLC1) and the heavy chain of cytoplasmic dynein (DHC1) on vesicles. In addition, genetic reduction of APP diminishes KLC1 and DHC1 levels on APP cargos. Finally, our data reveal that reduction of KLC1 leads to decreased levels of DHC1 on APP vesicles, suggesting that KLC1 is necessary for the association of DHC1 to these cargos, and help to explain previously reported retrograde transport defects generated when kinesin-1 is reduced.

22583494|t|Lithium reduces BACE1 overexpression, beta amyloid accumulation, and spatial learning deficits in mice with traumatic brain injury.
22583494|a|Traumatic brain injury (TBI) leads to both acute injury and long-term neurodegeneration, and is a major risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Beta amyloid (Abeta) peptide deposits in the brain are one of the pathological hallmarks of AD. Abeta levels increase after TBI in animal models and in patients with head trauma, and reducing Abeta levels after TBI has beneficial effects. Lithium is known to be neuroprotective in various models of neurodegenerative disease, and can reduce Abeta generation by modulating glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) activity. In this study we explored whether lithium would reduce Abeta load after TBI, and improve learning and memory in a mouse TBI model. Lithium chloride (1.5 mEq/kg, IP) was administered 15 min after TBI, and once daily thereafter for up to 3 weeks. At 3 days after injury, lithium attenuated TBI-induced Abeta load increases, amyloid precursor protein (APP) accumulation, and beta-APP-cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1) overexpression in the corpus callosum and hippocampus. Increased Tau protein phosphorylation in the thalamus was also attenuated after lithium treatment following TBI at the same time point. Notably, lithium treatment significantly improved spatial learning and memory in the Y-maze test conducted 10 days after TBI, and in the Morris water maze test performed 17-20 days post-TBI, in association with increased hippocampal preservation. Thus post-insult treatment with lithium appears to alleviate the TBI-induced Abeta load and consequently improves spatial memory. Our findings suggest that lithium is a potentially useful agent for managing memory impairments after TBI or other head trauma.

22584060|t|Dimeric structure of transmembrane domain of amyloid precursor protein in micellar environment.
22584060|a|Some pathogenic mutations associated with Alzheimer's disease are thought to affect structural-dynamic properties and the lateral dimerization of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in neuron membrane. Dimeric structure of APP transmembrane fragment Gln(686)-Lys(726) was determined in membrane-mimicking dodecylphosphocholine micelles using high-resolution NMR spectroscopy. The APP membrane-spanning alpha-helix Lys(699)-Lys(724) self-associates in a left-handed parallel dimer through extended heptad repeat motif I(702)X(3)M(706)X(2)G(709)X(3)A(713)X(2)I(716)X(3)I(720)X(2)I(723), whereas the juxtamembrane region Gln(686)-Val(695) constitutes the nascent helix, also sensing the dimerization. The dimerization mechanism of APP transmembrane domain has been described at atomic resolution for the first time and is important for understanding molecular events of APP sequential proteolytical cleavage resulting in amyloid-beta peptide.

22584945|t|Surface-engineered nanoliposomes by chelating ligands for modulating the neurotoxicity associated with beta-amyloid aggregates of Alzheimer's disease.
22584945|a|PURPOSE: To develop chelating ligand-bound nanoliposomes (NLPs) for the prevention and reversal of beta-Amyloid (Abeta) aggregation associated with promoting neurotoxicity in Alzheimer disease (AD). METHODS: Four different chelating ligands (CuAc, EDTA, histidine and ZnAc) were surface-engineered onto NLPs using either covalent or non-covalent conjugation. Successful conjugation of chelating ligands onto the surface of NLPs was confirmed by characterization studies: SEM, TEM and FTIR analysis. Chelation energetics of EDTA with Cu(II)/Zn(II)-Abeta(10-21) and nanoformation of emulsified polymers were computed and corroborated with experimental and analytical data using chemometric molecular modeling. RESULTS: The modified NLPs produced were spherical in shape, 127-178 nm in size, with polydispersity index from 0.217-0.920 and zeta potential range of -9.59 to -37.3 mV. Conjugation efficiencies were 30-76 %, which confirmed that chelating ligands were attached to the NLP surface. CONCLUSIONS: In vitro and ex vivo results elucidated the effectiveness of chelating ligand-bound NLPs for prevention of CuAbeta(1-42) or ZnAbeta(1-42) aggregate buildup associated with neurotoxicity in PC12 neuronal cells, as well as promotion of intracellular uptake in the presence of Cu(II) or Zn(II) metal ions.

22586140|t|The ups and downs of the posteromedial cortex: age- and amyloid-related functional alterations of the encoding/retrieval flip in cognitively normal older adults.
22586140|a|Neural networks supporting memory function decline with increasing age. Accumulation of amyloid-beta, a histopathological finding in Alzheimer's disease, is a likely contributor. Posteromedial cortices (PMCs) are particularly vulnerable to early amyloid pathology and play a role in both encoding and retrieval processes. The extent to which aging and amyloid influence the ability to modulate activity between these processes within the PMC was investigated by combining positron emission tomography-amyloid imaging with functional magnetic resonance imaging in cognitively normal older and young adults. Young subjects exhibited a marked decrease in activity during encoding and an increase during retrieval (also known as encoding/retrieval "flip"). Impaired ability to modulate activity was associated with increasing age, greater amyloid burden, and worse memory performance. In contrast, the hippocampus showed increased activity during both encoding and retrieval, which was not related to these variables. These findings support a specific link between amyloid pathology and neural dysfunction in PMC and elucidate the underpinnings of age-related memory dysfunction.

22587454|t|Dynamics of metastable beta-hairpin structures in the folding nucleus of amyloid beta-protein.
22587454|a|The amyloid beta-protein (Abeta), which is present predominately as a 40- or 42-residue peptide, is postulated to play a seminal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Folding of the Abeta(21-30) decapeptide region is a critical step in the aggregation of Abeta. We report results of constant temperature all-atom molecular dynamics simulations in explicit water of the dynamics of monomeric Abeta(21-30) and its Dutch [Glu22Gln], Arctic [Glu22Gly], and Iowa [Asp23Asn] isoforms that are associated with familial forms of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and AD. The simulations revealed a variety of loop conformers that exhibited a hydrogen bond network involving the Asp23 and Ser26 amino acids. A population of conformers, not part of the loop population, was found to form metastable beta-hairpin structures with the highest probability in the Iowa mutant. At least three beta-hairpin structures were found that differed in their hydrogen bonding register, average number of backbone hydrogen bonds, and lifetimes. Analysis revealed that the Dutch mutant had the longest beta-hairpin lifetime (>=500 ns), closely followed by the Iowa mutant ( 500 ns). Abeta(21-30) and the Arctic mutant had significantly lower lifetimes ( 200 ns). Hydrophobic packing of side chains was responsible for enhanced beta-hairpin lifetimes in the Dutch and Iowa mutants, whereas lifetimes in Abeta(21-30) and its Arctic mutant were influenced by the backbone hydrogen bonding. The data suggest that prolonged beta-hairpin lifetimes may impact peptide pathogenicity in vivo.

22587837|t|Anti-amyloidogenic effects of soybean isoflavones in vitro: Fluorescence spectroscopy demonstrating direct binding to Abeta monomers, oligomers and fibrils.
22587837|a|Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the presence of extracellular deposits of amyloid, primarily composed of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta). A growing body of evidence indicates that oligomeric forms of Abeta play a critical role in disease causation. Soybean isoflavones are flavonoids with an isoflavone backbone. Isoflavones have been reported to protect against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity in cultured cell systems, the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Our previous studies demonstrated that red wine-related flavonoids with a flavone backbone are able to inhibit Abeta assembly and destabilize preformed Abeta aggregates. Here, we show that isoflavones, especially glycitein and genistein, have anti-fibrillization, anti-oligomerization and fibril-destabilizing effects on Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42)in vitro at physiological pH and temperature, by using nucleation-dependent polymerization monitored by thioflavin T fluorescence, atomic force microscopy, electron microscopy, and photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins followed by SDS-PAGE. Our three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopic analyses demonstrated that glycitein interacted with Abeta monomers, oligomers and fibrils, indicating specific binding of glycitein to these Abeta species. Glycitein also interacted with different Abeta fragments (Abeta(1-42), Abeta(1-40), Abeta(1-16) and Abeta(25-35)), exhibiting the highest fluorescence enhancement with Abeta(25-35). We speculated that glycitein's anti-amyloidogenic properties are specifically mediated by its binding to Abeta monomers, oligomers and fibrils. Isoflavones may hold promise as a treatment option for preventative strategies targeting amyloid formation in Alzheimer's disease.

22587890|t|Evaluation of the effects of testosterone and luteinizing hormone on regulation of beta-amyloid in male 3xTg-AD mice.
22587890|a|During normal aging, men experience a significant decline in testosterone levels and a compensatory elevation in levels of gonadotropin luteinizing hormone (LH). Both low testosterone and elevated LH have been identified as significant risk factors for the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in men. It is unclear whether changes in testosterone or LH primarily underlie the relationship with AD, and therefore may be a more suitable therapeutic target. To examine this issue, we compared levels of beta-amyloid (Abeta) immunoreactivity in male 3xTg-AD mice under varying experimental conditions associated with relatively low or high levels of testosterone and/or LH. In gonadally intact mice, Abeta accumulation increased after treatment with the gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist leuprolide, which inhibits the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and reduces both testosterone and LH levels. In gonadectomized (GDX) mice with low testosterone and high LH, we also observed increased Abeta levels. Treatment of GDX mice with testosterone significantly reduced Abeta levels. In contrast, leuprolide did not significantly decrease Abeta levels and moreover, inhibited the Abeta-lowering effect of testosterone. Evaluation of hippocampal-dependent behavior revealed parallel findings, with performance in GDX mice improved by testosterone but not leuprolide. These data suggest that Abeta-lowering actions of testosterone are mediated directly by androgen pathways rather than indirectly via regulation of LH and the HPG axis. These findings support the clinical evaluation of androgen therapy in the prevention and perhaps treatment of AD in hypogonadal men.

22589542|t|Solid-state NMR reveals a close structural relationship between amyloid-beta protofibrils and oligomers.
22589542|a|We have studied tertiary contacts in protofibrils and mature fibrils of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides using solid-state NMR spectroscopy. Although intraresidue contacts between Glu-22 and Ile-31 were found in Abeta protofibrils, these contacts were completely absent in mature Abeta fibrils. This is consistent with the current models of mature Abeta fibrils. As these intramolecular contacts have also been reported in Abeta oligomers, our measurements suggest that Abeta protofibrils are structurally more closely related to oligomers than to mature fibrils. This suggests that some structural alterations have to take place on the pathway from Abeta oligomers/protofibrils to mature fibrils, in agreement with a model that suggests a conversion of intramolecular hydrogen-bonded structures of Abeta oligomers to the intermolecular stabilized mature fibrils (Hoyer, W., Gronwall, C., Jonsson, A., Stahl, S., and Hard, T. (2008) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 105, 5099-5104).

22592800|t|Critical role of soluble amyloid-beta for early hippocampal hyperactivity in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
22592800|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a progressive dysfunction of central neurons. Recent experimental evidence indicates that in the cortex, in addition to the silencing of a fraction of neurons, other neurons are hyperactive in amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaque-enriched regions. However, it has remained unknown what comes first, neuronal silencing or hyperactivity, and what mechanisms might underlie the primary neuronal dysfunction. Here we examine the activity patterns of hippocampal CA1 neurons in a mouse model of AD in vivo using two-photon Ca(2+) imaging. We found that neuronal activity in the plaque-bearing CA1 region of older mice is profoundly altered. There was a marked increase in the fractions of both silent and hyperactive neurons, as previously also found in the cortex. Remarkably, in the hippocampus of young mice, we observed a selective increase in hyperactive neurons already before the formation of plaques, suggesting that soluble species of Abeta may underlie this impairment. Indeed, we found that acute treatment with the gamma-secretase inhibitor LY-411575 reduces soluble Abeta levels and rescues the neuronal dysfunction. Furthermore, we demonstrate that direct application of soluble Abeta can induce neuronal hyperactivity in wild-type mice. Thus, our study identifies hippocampal hyperactivity as a very early functional impairment in AD transgenic mice and provides direct evidence that soluble Abeta is crucial for hippocampal hyperactivity.

22594938|t|Laser-induced liquid bead ion desorption mass spectrometry: an approach to precisely monitor the oligomerization of the beta-amyloid peptide.
22594938|a|In the present work, the recently developed laser-induced liquid bead ion desorption mass spectrometry (LILBID MS) is applied as a novel technique to study Abeta oligomerization, thought to be crucial in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The characterization of the earliest nucleation events of this peptide necessitates the application of several techniques to bridge the gap between small oligomers and large fibrils. We precisely monitored in time the transformation of monomeric Abeta (1-42) into oligomeric Abeta(n) (n < 20) and its dependence on concentration and agitation. The distribution shows signs of the hexamer being crucial in the assembly process. The intensity of the monomer decreases in time with a time constant of about 9 h. After a lag time of around 10 h, a phase transition occurred in which the total ion current of the oligomers goes to nearly zero. In this late stage of aggregation, protofibrils are formed and mass spectrometry is no longer sensitive. Here fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) are complementary tools for detection and size characterization of these large species. We also utilized the oligomers of Abeta (1-42) as a model of the corresponding in vivo process to screen the efficacy and specificity of small molecule inhibitors of oligomerization. The LILBID results are in excellent agreement with condensed phase behavior determined in other studies. Our data identified LILBID MS as a powerful technique that will advance the understanding of peptide oligomerization in neurodegenerative diseases and represents a powerful tool for the identification of small oligomerization inhibitors.

22596218|t|Amyloid-beta fibril disruption by C60-molecular guidance for rational drug design.
22596218|a|The WHO has listed Alzheimer's disease among the major neurological disorders with an estimated 35 million people affected worldwide. Amyloid-beta is mostly believed to be the causative factor in Alzheimer's disease and the severity of the disease correlates with the tendency of amyloid-beta to form aggregation patterns-plaques. Lacking effective medication, the identification of any underlying mechanistic principles regarding plaque formation appears to be crucial. Here we carry out computer simulations to study the effect of C60 on structure and stability of an idealised pentameric construct of amyloid-beta units (a model fibril). A binding site on top of the structurally ordered stack of beta-sheets is identified that triggers structural alterations at the turn region of the hook-like beta-sheet assembly. Significant structural alterations are: (i) the destruction of regular helical twist, (ii) the loss of a stabilizing salt bridge and (iii) the loss of a stabilizing hydrophobic interaction close to the turn. Consequently, the main effect of C60 is the induction of sizable destabilization in native fibril structure. These structural insights may serve as a molecular guide for further rational drug design of effective inhibitors targeting fibril formation in Alzheimer's disease.

22608923|t|Negative regulation of the stability and tumor suppressor function of Fbw7 by the Pin1 prolyl isomerase.
22608923|a|Fbw7 is the substrate recognition component of the Skp1-Cullin-F-box (SCF)-type E3 ligase complex and a well-characterized tumor suppressor that targets numerous oncoproteins for destruction. Genomic deletion or mutation of FBW7 has been frequently found in various types of human cancers; however, little is known about the upstream signaling pathway(s) governing Fbw7 stability and cellular functions. Here we report that Fbw7 protein destruction and tumor suppressor function are negatively regulated by the prolyl isomerase Pin1. Pin1 interacts with Fbw7 in a phoshorylation-dependent manner and promotes Fbw7 self-ubiquitination and protein degradation by disrupting Fbw7 dimerization. Consequently, overexpressing Pin1 reduces Fbw7 abundance and suppresses Fbw7's ability to inhibit proliferation and transformation. By contrast, depletion of Pin1 in cancer cells leads to elevated Fbw7 expression, which subsequently reduces Mcl-1 abundance, sensitizing cancer cells to Taxol. Thus, Pin1-mediated inhibition of Fbw7 contributes to oncogenesis, and Pin1 may be a promising drug target for anticancer therapy.

22609331|t|Norepinephrine differentially modulates the innate inflammatory response provoked by amyloid-beta peptide via action at beta-adrenoceptors and activation of cAMP/PKA pathway in human THP-1 macrophages.
22609331|a|Evidence indicates that norepinephrine (NE) has antiinflammatory activities and plays a neuroprotective role where inflammatory events contribute to Alzheimer's disease pathology. Here, we evaluated the effects of NE on amyloid beta 1-42 (Abeta1-42)-induced cytotoxicity and proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine secretion, and determined the mechanisms through which NE exerts its actions in human THP-1 macrophages. NE clearly reduced the Abeta1-42-mediated production of the proinflammatory chemokine, monocytic chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2). In contrast to its ability to reduce MCP-1 secretion, NE enhanced the amounts of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1beta secreted from Abeta1-42 treated cells. NE significantly reduced the Abeta1-42-induced cytotoxicity in situations where it contributed to the increased IL-1beta and decreased MCP-1 during Abeta1-42 stimulation. The ability of NE to differentially modulate the Abeta1-42-induced immune responses was mediated by beta-adrenoceptors, as the aforementioned effects were replicated by the beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoproterenol, and blocked by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, dl-propranolol. Of note, the NE effects on Abeta1-42-induced responses were mimicked by dbcAMP and forskolin, but significantly blocked by H89, an inhibitor of PKA. Moreover, NE abolished Abeta1-42-mediated decline of CREB phosphorylation. Overall, NE suppresses Abeta1-42-mediated cytotoxicity and MCP-1 secretion, but enhances Abeta-mediated IL-1beta secretion through action at beta-adrenoceptors, accompanied by activation of cAMP/PKA pathway and CREB in human microglia-like THP-1 cells.

22609417|a|All-atom MD simulations of pre-formed aggregates of GNNQQNY with variable size (5 to 16 peptides), orientation (parallel or anti-parallel), organization (single or double sheet, with or without twist), charge status of termini and temperature (300 and 330K) have been performed for 50ns each (68 simulations; total time=3.4mus). Double-layer systems are stable irrespective of whether the peptides within the sheet are oriented parallel or anti-parallel. The lifetime of single sheet systems is determined by the protonation status, nature of association of peptides and the size of the aggregates. For example, single sheet 8-mers are stable with parallel arrangement and neutral termini, or with anti-parallel arrangement and charged termini. This suggests that the residues flanking the amyloidogenic sequence also play an important role in determining the organization of peptides in an aggregate. Twist of the cross-beta sheets is found to be intrinsic to the aggregates. Main chain H-bonds are key determinants of stability and loss of these H-bonds is followed by disorder and/or dissociation of the peptide despite the presence of side chain hydrogen bonds. Aggregates are inherently asymmetric along the fiber axis and dissociation from the C-edge is observed more often. An aggregate can disintegrate into smaller-sized oligomers or the edge peptides can dissociate sequentially. A variety of dissociation and disintegration events are observed pointing to the existence of multiple pathways for association during nucleation. It appears that a heterogeneous mixture of oligomers of different sizes exist prior to the formation of the critical nucleus.

22613765|t|The APP intracellular domain (AICD) inhibits Wnt signalling and promotes neurite outgrowth.
22613765|a|beta- and gamma-secretase cleave the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to release the amyloidogenic beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta) and the APP intracellular domain (AICD). Abeta has been widely believed to initiate pathogenic cascades culminating in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the physiological functions of the AICD remain elusive. In this study, we found the AICD to strongly inhibit Wnt-induced transcriptional reporter activity, and to counteract Wnt-induced c-Myc expression. Loss of the AICD resulted in an increased responsiveness to Wnt/beta-catenin-mediated transcription. Mechanically, the AICD was found to interact with glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3beta) and promote its kinase activity. The subsequent AICD-strengthened Axin-GSK3beta complex potentiates beta-catenin poly-ubiquitination. Functional studies in N(2)a mouse neuroblastoma cells, rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells and primary neurons showed that the AICD facilitated neurite outgrowth. And AICD antagonised Wnt3a-suppressed growth arrest and neurite outgrowth in N2a and PC12 cells. Taken together, our results identify the AICD as a novel inhibitory factor of the canonical Wnt signalling pathway and suggest its regulatory role in neuronal cell proliferation and differentiation.

22614327|t|CSF biomarker associations with change in hippocampal volume and precuneus thickness: implications for the Alzheimer's pathological cascade.
22614327|a|Neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and amyloid plaques are hallmark neuropathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is some debate as to which neuropathological feature comes first in the disease process, with early autopsy studies suggesting that NFT develop first, and more recent neuroimaging studies supporting the early role of amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of Abeta42 and hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) have been shown to serve as in vivo proxy measures of amyloid plaques and NFT, respectively. The aim of this study was to examine the association between CSF biomarkers and rate of atrophy in the precuneus and hippocampus. These regions were selected because the precuneus appears to be affected early and severely by Abeta deposition, and the hippocampus similarly by NFT pathology. We predicted (1) baseline Abeta42 would be related to accelerated rate of cortical thinning in the precuneus and volume loss in the hippocampus, with the latter relationship expected to be weaker, (2) baseline p-tau(181p) would be related to accelerated rate of hippocampal atrophy and cortical thinning in the precuneus, with the latter relationship expected to be weaker. Using all ADNI cohorts, we fitted separate linear mixed-effects models for changes in hippocampus and precuneus longitudinal outcome measures with baseline CSF biomarkers modeled as predictors. Results partially supported our hypotheses: Both baseline p-tau(181p) and Abeta42 were associated with hippocampal atrophy over time. Neither p-tau(181p) nor Abeta42 were significantly related to cortical thinning in the precuneus over time. However, follow-up analyses demonstrated that having abnormal levels of both Abeta42 and p-tau(181p) was associated with an accelerated rate of atrophy in both the hippocampus and precuneus. Results support early effects of Abeta in the Alzheimer's disease process, which are less apparent than and perhaps dependent on p-tau effects as the disease progresses. However, amyloid deposition alone may be insufficient for emergence of significant morphometric changes and clinical symptoms.

22615109|t|Hypertension induces brain beta-amyloid accumulation, cognitive impairment, and memory deterioration through activation of receptor for advanced glycation end products in brain vasculature.
22615109|a|Although epidemiological data associate hypertension with a strong predisposition to develop Alzheimer disease, no mechanistic explanation exists so far. We developed a model of hypertension, obtained by transverse aortic constriction, leading to alterations typical of Alzheimer disease, such as amyloid plaques, neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier dysfunction, and cognitive impairment, shown here for the first time. The aim of this work was to investigate the mechanisms involved in Alzheimer disease of hypertensive mice. We focused on receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) that critically regulates Abeta transport at the blood-brain barrier and could be influenced by vascular factors. The hypertensive challenge had an early and sustained effect on RAGE upregulation in brain vessels of the cortex and hippocampus. Interestingly, RAGE inhibition protected from hypertension-induced Alzheimer pathology, as showed by rescue from cognitive impairment and parenchymal Abeta deposition. The increased RAGE expression in transverse aortic coarctation mice was induced by increased circulating advanced glycation end products and sustained by their later deposition in brain vessels. Interestingly, a daily treatment with an advanced glycation end product inhibitor or antioxidant prevented the development of Alzheimer traits. So far, Alzheimer pathology in experimental animal models has been recognized using only transgenic mice overexpressing amyloid precursor. This is the first study demonstrating that a chronic vascular insult can activate brain vascular RAGE, favoring parenchymal Abeta deposition and the onset of cognitive deterioration. Overall we demonstrate that RAGE activation in brain vessels is a crucial pathogenetic event in hypertension-induced Alzheimer disease, suggesting that inhibiting this target can limit the onset of vascular-related Alzheimer disease.

22615372|t|Structural differences between apoE3 and apoE4 may be useful in developing therapeutic agents for Alzheimer's disease.
22615372|a|Apolipoproteins E3 and E4, proteins with a molecular mass of 34.15 kDa, differ by a single amino acid change. ApoE4 contains an arginine residue at position 112, whereas apoE3 has a cysteine at this position. ApoE4 is the major risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, whereas apoE3, the common isoform, is neutral with respect to this disease. Here, using literature data from both hydrogen-deuterium exchange and site-directed mutations, we suggest structural differences between these two isoforms that are distant from the site of the arginine-to-cysteine change. These structural differences involve sequences from both the N- and C-terminal domains, sequentially far apart but structurally close. In addition, these regions are close to regions that bind lipid and to a region involved in association of apoE monomers to higher molecular weight forms. We discuss the possibility that these regions could be targeted preferentially to affect the function of apoE4 relative to apoE3.

22617143|t|Ginsenoside Rg1 prevents SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cell apoptosis induced by supernatant from Abeta1-40-stimulated THP-1 monocytes.
22617143|a|Excessive accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) has been proposed as a pivotal event in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Possible mechanisms underlying Abeta-induced neurotoxicity include inflammation and apoptosis. Here, the protective effect of ginsenoside Rg1 (GRg1) on neuronal damage was examined in an in vitro inflammatory neurodegeneration model. Supernatant from Abeta(1-40)-stimulated THP-1 monocytes was added to SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cell culture medium. Incubation of SK-N-SH cells with cell-free supernatant from Abeta(1-40) (125nM)-treated THP-1 monocytes for 24 h significantly increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, cell apoptosis, Bax and caspase-3 expression in SK-N-SH cells. However, pretreating THP-1 monocytes with GRg1 (50, 100 or 150 muM) for 30 min markedly reduced IL-1beta, IL-8 and TNF-alpha levels in Abeta(1-40)-stimulated supernatant. LDH release, cell apoptosis, Bax and caspase-3 expression in SK-N-SH cells were significantly decreased when cultured with cell-free supernatant from Abeta(1-40)-stimulated THP-1 monocytes that were pretreated with GRg1. The results suggest that Abeta(1-40)-induced neuronal injury and apoptosis may be mediated by inflammatory monocyte reactions, and GRg1 exerts a protective effect against Abeta(1-40)-induced neuronal injury and apoptosis, likely through its anti-inflammatory mechanism.

22621179|t|Overlapping profiles of Abeta peptides in the Alzheimer's disease and pathological aging brains.
22621179|a|INTRODUCTION: A hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the presence of senile plaques composed of aggregated amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides. Pathological aging (PA) is a postmortem classification that has been used to describe brains with plaque pathology similar in extent to AD, minimal cortical tau pathology, and no accompanying history of cognitive decline in the brain donor prior to death. PA may represent either a prodromal phase of AD, a benign form of Abeta accumulation, or inherent individual resistance to the toxic effects of Abeta accumulation. To attempt to distinguish between these possibilities we have systematically characterized Abeta peptides in a postmortem series of PA, AD and non-demented control (NDC) brains. METHODS: Abeta was sequentially extracted with tris buffered saline (TBS), radioimmunoprecipitation buffer (RIPA), 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 70% formic acid (FA) from the pre-frontal cortex of 16 AD, eight PA, and six NDC patients. These extracts were analyzed by 1) a panel of Abeta sandwich ELISAs, 2) immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry (IP/MS) and 3) western blotting. These studies enabled us to asses Abeta levels and solubility, peptide profiles and oligomeric assemblies. RESULTS: In almost all extracts (TBS, RIPA, 2% SDS and 70% FA) the average levels of Abeta1-40, Abeta1-42, Abeta total, and Abetax-42 were greatest in AD. On average, levels were slightly lower in PA, and there was extensive overlap between Abeta levels in individual PA and AD cases. The profiles of Abeta peptides detected using IP/MS techniques also showed extensive similarity between the PA and AD brain extracts. In select AD brain extracts, we detected more amino-terminally truncated Abeta peptides compared to PA patients, but these peptides represented a minor portion of the Abeta observed. No consistent differences in the Abeta assemblies were observed by western blotting in the PA and AD groups. CONCLUSIONS: We found extensive overlap with only subtle quantitative differences between Abeta levels, peptide profiles, solubility, and SDS-stable oligomeric assemblies in the PA and AD brains. These cross-sectional data indicate that Abeta accumulation in PA and AD is remarkably similar. Such data would be consistent with PA representing a prodromal stage of AD or a resistance to the toxic effects of Abeta.

22621777|t|Tauroursodeoxycholic acid suppresses amyloid beta-induced synaptic toxicity in vitro and in APP/PS1 mice.
22621777|a|Synapses are considered the earliest site of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, where synapse density is reduced, and synaptic loss is highly correlated with cognitive impairment. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) has been shown to be neuroprotective in several models of AD, including neuronal exposure to amyloid beta (Abeta) and amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 1 (PS1) double-transgenic mice. Here, we show that TUDCA modulates synaptic deficits induced by Abeta in vitro. Specifically, TUDCA reduced the downregulation of the postsynaptic marker postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) and the decrease in spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) frequency, while increasing the number of dendritic spines. This contributed to the induction of more robust and synaptically efficient neurons, reflected in inhibition of neuronal death. In vivo, TUDCA treatment of APP/PS1 mice abrogated the decrease in PSD-95 reactivity in the hippocampus. Taken together, these results expand the neuroprotective role of TUDCA to a synaptic level, further supporting the use of this molecule as a potential therapeutic strategy for the prevention and treatment of AD.

22622366|t|A novel ARC gene polymorphism is associated with reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease.
22622366|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, and is clinically characterized by cognitive disturbances and the accumulation of the amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides in plaques in the brain. Recent studies have shown the links between AD and the immediate-early gene Arc (activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein), involved in synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation. For example, AD mouse models show a decreased expression of Arc mRNA in the brain. In additional, acute Abeta application to brain slices leads to a widespread ARC protein diffusion, unlike the normal defined localization to synapses. In this study, we investigated genetic variation in human ARC and the risk of developing AD. To this end, we genotyped 713 subjects diagnosed with AD and 841 controls without dementia. ARC was sequenced in a group of healthy individuals, and seven previously known SNPs and three novel SNPs were identified. Two of the newly found SNPs were intronic and one, +2852(G/A), was located in the 3'UTR. Three tag SNPs were selected, including the novel SNP +2852(G/A), to relate to risk of AD, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker levels of total tau (T-tau), hyperphosphorylated tau181 (P-tau(181)) and Abeta(1-42). The AA genotype of the newly found 3'-UTR SNP +2852(A/G), was associated with a decreased risk of AD (p                         (c) = 0.005; OR = 0.74; 95 % CI: 0.61-0.89). No associations of single SNPs or haplotypes with MMSE score or CSF biomarkers were found. Here we report a novel ARC SNP associated with a reduced risk of developing AD. To our knowledge, this is the first study associating a gene variant of ARC with any disease. The location of the SNP within the 3'UTR indicates that dendritic targeting of ARC mRNA could be involved in the molecular mechanisms underlying this protective function. However, further investigation of the importance of this SNP for ARC function, ARC processing and the pathology of AD is needed.

22622580|t|Apolipoprotein E controls cerebrovascular integrity via cyclophilin A.
22622580|a|Human apolipoprotein E has three isoforms: APOE2, APOE3 and APOE4. APOE4 is a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and is associated with Down's syndrome dementia and poor neurological outcome after traumatic brain injury and haemorrhage. Neurovascular dysfunction is present in normal APOE4 carriers and individuals with APOE4-associated disorders. In mice, lack of Apoe leads to blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, whereas APOE4 increases BBB susceptibility to injury. How APOE genotype affects brain microcirculation remains elusive. Using different APOE transgenic mice, including mice with ablation and/or inhibition of cyclophilin A (CypA), here we show that expression of APOE4 and lack of murine Apoe, but not APOE2 and APOE3, leads to BBB breakdown by activating a proinflammatory CypA-nuclear factor-kappaB-matrix-metalloproteinase-9 pathway in pericytes. This, in turn, leads to neuronal uptake of multiple blood-derived neurotoxic proteins, and microvascular and cerebral blood flow reductions. We show that the vascular defects in Apoe-deficient and APOE4-expressing mice precede neuronal dysfunction and can initiate neurodegenerative changes. Astrocyte-secreted APOE3, but not APOE4, suppressed the CypA-nuclear factor-kappaB-matrix-metalloproteinase-9 pathway in pericytes through a lipoprotein receptor. Our data suggest that CypA is a key target for treating APOE4-mediated neurovascular injury and the resulting neuronal dysfunction and degeneration.

22623685|t|Selectively silencing GSK-3 isoforms reduces plaques and tangles in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.
22623685|a|Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is linked to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), senile plaques (SPs), and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), but the specific contributions of each of the GSK-3 alpha and beta isoforms to mechanisms of AD have not been clarified. In this study, we sought to elucidate the role of each GSK-3alpha and GSK-3beta using novel viral and genetic approaches. First, we developed recombinant adeno-associated virus 2/1 short hairpin RNA constructs which specifically reduced expression and activity of GSK-3alpha or GSK-3beta. These constructs were injected intraventricularly in newborn AD transgenic (tg) mouse models of SPs (PDAPP+/-), both SPs and NFTs (PDAPP+/-;PS19+/-), or wild-type controls. We found that knockdown (KD) of GSK-3alpha, but not GSK-3beta, reduced SP formation in PDAPP+/- and PS19+/-;PDAPP+/- tg mice. Moreover, both GSK-3alpha and GSK-3beta KD reduced tau phosphorylation and tau misfolding in PS19+/-;PDAPP+/- mice. Next, we generated triple tg mice using the CaMKIIalpha-Cre (alpha-calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-Cre) system to KD GSK-3alpha in PDAPP+/- mice for further study of the effects of GSK-3alpha reduction on SP formation. GSK-3alpha KD showed a significant effect on reducing SPs and ameliorating memory deficits in PDAPP+/- mice. Together, the data from both approaches suggest that GSK-3alpha contributes to both SP and NFT pathogenesis while GSK-3beta only modulates NFT formation, suggesting common but also different targets for both isoforms. These findings highlight the potential importance of GSK-3alpha as a possible therapeutic target for ameliorating behavioral impairments linked to AD SPs and NFTs.

22624578|t|Imaging amyloid plaque in Alzheimer's disease brain with a biotinylated Abeta peptide radiopharmaceutical conjugated to an IgG-avidin fusion protein.
22624578|a|The Abeta amyloid peptide of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a potentially large molecule radiopharmaceutical for imaging the brain amyloid burden, should the peptide be made transportable across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Peptides can be made BBB-penetrating with the combined use of Trojan horse and avidin-biotin technologies. The peptide is monobiotinylated and attached to a fusion protein of avidin (AV) and a genetically engineered monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the human insulin receptor (HIR). The fusion protein is designated HIRMAb-AV, and is produced by stably transfected mammalian host cells grown in biotin free medium. The HIRMAb domain of the fusion protein acts as a molecular Trojan horse, which crosses the BBB via transport on the endogenous insulin receptor. The avidin domain of the fusion protein creates a high-affinity linker between the HIRMAb and the biotinylated peptide radiopharmaceutical. The 4 kDa Abeta(1-40) amyloid peptide of AD was N-biotinylated and radiolabeled with (125)I. The amyloid plaque binding of the [(125)I]-N-biotinyl-Abeta(1-40) peptide, either without or with conjugation to the HIRMAb-AV fusion protein, was tested with film autoradiography and tissue sections of autopsy AD brain. The study shows the biotinyl-Abeta(1-40) peptide still binds to amyloid plaque in AD brain to the same extent when the peptide radiopharmaceutical is either free or conjugated to the HIRMAb-AV fusion protein. The study supports further evaluation of antibody-targeted peptide radiopharmaceuticals as large molecule neuro-imaging agents that penetrate the BBB.

22626060|t|Reciprocal regulation of cholesterol and beta amyloid at the subcellular level in Alzheimer's disease.
22626060|a|Since the discovery that apolipoprotein E, a cholesterol transport protein, is a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) development, there has been a remarkable interest in understanding the many facets of the relationship between cholesterol and AD. Several lines of evidence have demonstrated the importance of cholesterol in amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) production and metabolism, as well as the involvement of Abeta in cholesterol homeostasis. The emerging picture is complex and still incomplete. This review discusses findings that indicate that a reciprocal regulation exists between Abeta and cholesterol at the subcellular level. The pathological impact of such regulation is highlighted.

22628162|a|Amyloid-beta deposition in Alzheimer's disease is thought to start while individuals are still cognitively unimpaired and it is hypothesized that after an early phase of fast accumulation, a plateau is reached by the time of cognitive decline. However, few longitudinal Pittsburgh compound B-positron emission tomography studies have tested this hypothesis, and with conflicting results. The purpose of this work is to further our understanding of the dynamics of amyloid-beta deposition in a large longitudinal cohort. A total of 32 patients with Alzheimer's disease, 49 subjects with mild cognitive impairment and 103 healthy controls underwent two Pittsburgh compound B-positron emission tomography scans 18 months apart. For each participant, a parametric map of Pittsburgh compound B-positron emission tomography rate of change was created [(follow-up scan - baseline scan)/follow-up duration] and entered in a voxelwise three-way analysis of covariance, with clinical status (healthy controls, mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease), disease progression (clinical conversion from healthy controls to mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease, or from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease) and Pittsburgh compound B status (positive versus negative) as independent factors. Only a significant effect of the Pittsburgh compound B status was found: both Pittsburgh compound B-positive and -negative subjects showed a significant increase in amyloid-beta deposition, with this increase being significantly higher in Pittsburgh compound B-positive individuals. This finding suggests either that Pittsburgh compound B-negative individuals have slower rates of amyloid-beta accumulation than positive, or that the proportion of individuals showing significant increase in amyloid-beta deposition, termed 'Pittsburgh compound B accumulators', is higher within the Pittsburgh compound B-positive group than within the Pittsburgh compound B-negative group. The bimodal distribution of the individual rates of neocortical amyloid-beta accumulation observed support the existence of 'Pittsburgh compound B non-accumulators' and 'Pittsburgh compound B accumulators' and different clustering analyses led to a consistent threshold to separate these two subgroups (0.014-0.022 standardized uptake value ratio(pons)/year). The voxelwise three-way analysis of covariance was thus recomputed with the 'Pittsburgh compound B accumulators' only and the results were almost unchanged, with the Pittsburgh compound B-positive group showing higher accumulation than the Pittsburgh compound B-negative group. Finally, a significant negative correlation was found between Pittsburgh compound B rate of change and Pittsburgh compound B baseline burden, but only in the Pittsburgh compound B-positive group (r= -0.24; P=0.025). Higher rates of amyloid-beta deposition are associated with higher amyloid-beta burden suggesting that amyloid-beta deposition does not reach a plateau when cognitive impairments manifest but is instead an ongoing process present even at the Alzheimer's disease stage. amyloid-beta accumulation also seems to slow down at the latest stages of the process, i.e. in participants with the highest amyloid burden. Furthermore, this study identified the existence of Pittsburgh compound 'accumulators' and 'non-accumulators', notably within the Pittsburgh compound B-negative group, which may be a relevant concept for future studies.

22631869|t|Selenium-enhanced electron microscopic imaging of different aggregate forms of a segment of the amyloid beta peptide in cells.
22631869|a|The aggregation of misfolded proteins is a common feature underlying a wide range of age-related degenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. A key aspect of understanding the molecular origins of these conditions is to define the manner in which specific types of protein aggregates influence disease pathogenesis through their interactions with cells. We demonstrate how selenium-enhanced electron microscopy (SE-EM), combined with tomographic reconstruction methods, can be used to image, here at a resolution of 5-10 nm, the interaction with human macrophage cells of amyloid aggregates formed from Abeta(25-36), a fragment of the Abeta peptide whose self-assembly is associated with Alzheimer's disease. We find that prefibrillar aggregates and mature fibrils are distributed into distinct subcellular compartments and undergo varying degrees of morphological change over time, observations that shed new light on the origins of their differential toxicity and the mechanisms of their clearance. In addition, the results show that SE-EM provides a powerful and potentially widely applicable means to define the nature and location of protein assemblies in situ and to provide detailed and specific information about their partitioning and processing.

22634014|t|Elevated amyloid beta production in senescent retinal pigment epithelium, a possible mechanism of subretinal deposition of amyloid beta in age-related macular degeneration.
22634014|a|Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of legal blindness in the elderly individuals in developed countries. Subretinally-deposited amyloid beta (Abeta) is a main contributor of developing AMD. However, the mechanism causing Abeta deposition in AMD eyes is unknown. Aging is the most significant risk of AMD, thus, we examined the effect of aging on subretinal Abeta deposition. mRNAs and cell lysates were isolated from retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells derived from 24-month-old (24M RPE) and 2-month-old (2M RPE) C57BL/6 mice. Abeta concentration in culture supernatants was measured by ELISA. Activity and expression of proteins that regulate Abeta level were examined by activity assay and real time PCR. Effect of beta-secretase (BACE) on Abeta production was examined by siRNA silencing. Abeta amounts in supernatants of 24M RPE were significantly higher than 2M RPE. Activity and mRNA levels of neprilysin, an Abeta degrading enzyme, were significantly decreased in 24M RPE compared to 2M RPE. PCR analysis found that BACE2 was significantly more abundantly expressed than BACE1 in RPE cells, however, inactivation of BACE2 gene did not affect Abeta production. BACE1 protein amounts did not differ between 24M and 2M RPE, however, BACE1 activity was significantly higher in 24M RPE compared to 2M RPE. There were no significant changes in the activities of alpha- or gamma-secretase between 2M and 24M RPE. In conclusion, RPE cells produce more amounts of Abeta when they are senescent, and this is probably caused by a decrease in Abeta degradation due to a reduction in the expression and activity of neprilysin and an increase in Abeta synthesis due to increased activity of BACE1.

22634229|t|WIN55212-2 attenuates amyloid-beta-induced neuroinflammation in rats through activation of cannabinoid receptors and PPAR-gamma pathway.
22634229|a|Cannabinoids have been shown to exert neuroprotective effects in a plethora of neurodegenerative conditions. Over the past decade, some studies demonstrate that cannabinoids can interact with nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). We investigated protective properties of WIN55212-2 (WIN, a non-selective cannabinoid receptor agonist) in beta-amyloid (Abeta)-induced neurodegeneration in rat hippocampus and possible involvement of PPAR-gamma (PPAR-gamma). Abeta (1-42) was injected into the hippocampus of male rats. Animals were administered by intracerebroventricular rout the following treatments on days 1, 3, 5, 7: vehicle, WIN, GW9662 (selective PPAR-gamma antagonist) plus WIN, AM251 (selective CB1 receptor antagonist) plus WIN, SR144528 (selective CB2 receptor antagonist) plus WIN, each of antagonists alone. Injection of Abeta-induced spatial memory impairment and a dramatic rise in hippocampal TNF-alpha, active caspase 3, nuclear NF-kB levels and TUNEL-positive neurons. WIN administration significantly improved memory function and diminished the elevated levels of these markers, while antagonizing either CB1 or CB2 receptor subtype partially attenuated the protective effects. Intriguingly, WIN significantly increased PPAR-gamma level and transcriptional activity, the latter being partially inhibited with AM251 but not with SR144528. The enhancing effect on PPAR-gamma pathway was crucial to WIN-induced neuroprotection since GW9662 partially reversed the beneficial actions of WIN. Co-administration of the three antagonists led to the complete abrogation of WIN effects. Our findings indicate that WIN exerts neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory actions against Abeta damage through both CB1 and CB2 receptors. Of great note, both direct and CB1-mediated increase in PPAR-gamma signaling also contributes to WIN-induced neuroprotection.

22635103|t|Human apolipoprotein E2 promotes parenchymal amyloid deposition and neuronal loss in vasculotropic mutant amyloid-beta protein Tg-SwDI mice.
22635103|a|Human apolipoprotein (ApoE) genotype influences the development of Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), where the epsilon4 allele increases and the epsilon2 allele decreases the risk for developing disease. Specific mutations within the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide have been identified that cause familial forms of CAA. However, the influence of APOE genotype on accumulation of CAA mutant Abeta in brain is not well understood. Earlier, we showed that human ApoE4 redistributes fibrillar amyloid deposition from the cerebral microvasculature to parenchymal plaques in Tg-SwDI mice, a model that accumulates human Dutch/Iowa (E22Q/D23N) CAA mutant Abeta in brain (Xu et al., J Neurosci 28, 5312-5320, 2008). Human ApoE2 can reduce Abeta pathology in transgenic models of parenchymal plaques. Here we determined if human ApoE2 can influence the location and severity of amyloid pathology in Tg-SwDI mice. Comparing Tg-SwDI mice bred onto a human APOE2/2 or human APOE4/4 background, we found there was no change in the brain levels of total Abeta(40) and Abeta(42) compared to mice on the endogenous mouse APOE background. In Tg-SwDI mice on either human APOE background, there was a similarly strong reduction in the levels of microvascular CAA and emergence of extensive parenchymal plaque amyloid. In both Tg-SwDI-hAPOE2/2 and Tg-SwDI-hAPOE4/4 mice, the distribution of ApoE proteins and neuronal loss were associated with parenchymal amyloid plaques. These findings suggest that compared with human ApoE4, human ApoE2 does not beneficially influence the quantitative or spatial accumulation of human Dutch/Iowa CAA mutant amyloid or associated pathology in transgenic mice.

22635104|t|Involvement of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor signaling in the amyloid-beta peptide oligomers-induced p75 neurotrophin receptor protein expression in mouse hippocampus.
22635104|a|The p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) has been thought to play a critical role in amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta)-mediated neurodegeneration and Abeta metabolism in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. Our previous report showed that membrane-associated p75NTR protein expression was significantly increased in the hippocampi of two different strains of transgenic AD mice and was associated with the age-dependent elevation of Abeta1-42 levels. Here, we provide evidence that the Abeta1-42 oligomers known as ADDLs (Abeta-derived diffusible ligands) induce p75NTR protein expression through insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) phosphorylation in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. An in vivo microinjection study demonstrated that microinjected ADDLs increased the p75NTR protein expression by 1.4-fold in the ipsilateral hippocampus compared to the contralateral hippocampus. In addition, ADDLs microinjected into mouse hippocampi facilitated IGF-1R phosphorylation within 30 min and the co-administration of picropodophyllin, an IGF-1R kinase inhibitor, blocked ADDLs-induced p75NTR expression. We examined the possible involvement of IGF-1R in the increased p75NTR protein expression in the hippocampi of 6-month-old AbetaPPswe/PS1dE9 AD model mice that had accumulated significant amounts of Abeta1-42 and showed significantly higher p75NTR expression than age-matched wild-type mice. We found that IGF-1R phosphorylation in these transgenic mice was higher than that in the wild-type mice. These findings indicate that Abeta1-42 oligomers stimulate the p75NTR protein expression in the hippocampus through IGF-1R signaling. Thus, Abeta1-42 oligomers-mediated IGF-1R activation may trigger an increase in p75NTR protein expression in the hippocampus of AD brain during the early stages of disease development.

22637581|t|C-terminal fragment of N-cadherin accelerates synapse destabilization by amyloid-beta.
22637581|a|The aetiology of Alzheimer's disease is thought to include functional impairment of synapses and synapse loss as crucial pathological events leading to cognitive dysfunction and memory loss. Oligomeric amyloid-beta peptides are well known to induce functional damage, destabilization and loss of brain synapses. However, the complex molecular mechanisms of amyloid-beta action resulting ultimately in synapse elimination are incompletely understood, thus limiting knowledge of potential therapeutic targets. Under physiological conditions, long-term synapse stability is mediated by trans-synaptically interacting adhesion molecules such as the homophilically binding N-cadherin/catenin complexes. In this study, we addressed whether inhibition of N-cadherin function affects amyloid-beta-induced synapse impairment. We found that blocking N-cadherin function, both by specific peptides interfering with homophilic binding and by expression of a dominant-negative, ectodomain-deleted N-cadherin mutant, resulted in a strong acceleration of the effect of amyloid-beta on synapse function in cultured cortical neurons. The frequency of AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) receptor-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents was reduced upon amyloid-beta application much earlier than observed in controls. We further hypothesized that ectodomain-shed, transmembrane C-terminal fragments that are generated during N-cadherin proteolytic processing might similarly enhance amyloid-beta-induced synapse damage. Indeed, expression of human N-cadherin C-terminal fragment 1 strongly accelerated amyloid-beta-triggered synapse impairment. Ectodomain-shed N-cadherin C-terminal fragment 1 is further proteolytically cleaved by gamma-secretase. Therefore, both pharmacological inhibition of gamma-secretase and expression of the dominant-negative presenilin 1 mutant L166P were used to increase the presence of endogeneous N-cadherin C-terminal fragment 1. Under these conditions, we again found a strong acceleration of amyloid-beta-induced synapse impairment, which could be compensated by over-expression of full-length N-cadherin. Intriguingly, western blot analysis of post-mortem brains from patients with Alzheimer's disease revealed an enhanced presence of N-cadherin C-terminal fragment 1. Thus, an inhibition of N-cadherin function by proteolytically generated N-cadherin C-terminal fragment 1 might play an important role in Alzheimer's disease progression by accelerating amyloid-beta-triggered synapse damage.

22637583|t|Apolipoprotein E4 effects in Alzheimer's disease are mediated by synaptotoxic oligomeric amyloid-beta.
22637583|a|The apolipoprotein E epsilon4 gene is the most important genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease, but the link between this gene and neurodegeneration remains unclear. Using array tomography, we analysed >50000 synapses in brains of 11 patients with Alzheimer's disease and five non-demented control subjects and found that synapse loss around senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease correlates with the burden of oligomeric amyloid-beta in the neuropil and that this synaptotoxic oligomerized peptide is present at a subset of synapses. Further analysis reveals apolipoprotein E epsilon4 patients with Alzheimer's disease have significantly higher oligomeric amyloid-beta burden and exacerbated synapse loss around plaques compared with apolipoprotein E epsilon3 patients. Apolipoprotein E4 protein colocalizes with oligomeric amyloid-beta and enhances synaptic localization of oligomeric amyloid-beta by >5-fold. Biochemical characterization shows that the amyloid-beta enriched at synapses by apolipoprotein E4 includes sodium dodecyl sulphate-stable dimers and trimers. In mouse primary neuronal culture, lipidated apolipoprotein E4 enhances oligomeric amyloid-beta association with synapses via a mechanism involving apolipoprotein E receptors. Together, these data suggest that apolipoprotein E4 is a co-factor that enhances the toxicity of oligomeric amyloid-beta both by increasing its levels and directing it to synapses, providing a link between apolipoprotein E epsilon4 genotype and synapse loss, a major correlate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.

22638775|t|Amyloid-beta protein modulates insulin signaling in presynaptic terminals.
22638775|a|Synaptic loss is a major neuropathological correlate of memory decline as a result of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This phenomenon appears to be aggravated by soluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers causing presynaptic terminals to be particularly vulnerable to damage. Furthermore, insulin is known to participate in synaptic plasticity through the activation of the insulin receptor (IR) and the PI3K signaling pathway, while low concentrations of soluble Abeta and Abeta oligomers aberrantly modulate IR function in cultured neurons. To further examine how Abeta and insulin interact in the pathology of AD, the present work analyzes the effect of insulin and Abeta in the activation of the IR/PI3K pathway in synaptosomes. We found that insulin increased mitochondrial activity and IR/Akt phosphorylation in synaptosomes taken from both hippocampus and cortex. Also, pretreatment with Abeta antagonized insulin's effect on hippocampal synaptosomes, but not vice versa. These results show that Abeta can reduce responsiveness to insulin. Combined with evidence that insulin desensitization can increase the risk of developing AD, our results suggest that the initial mechanism that impairs synaptic maintenance in AD might start with Abeta changes in insulin sensitivity.

22640423|t|Absence of amyloid beta oligomers at the postsynapse and regulated synaptic Zn2+ in cognitively intact aged individuals with Alzheimer's disease neuropathology.
22640423|a|BACKGROUND: Early cognitive impairment in Alzheimer Disease (AD) is thought to result from the dysfunctional effect of amyloid beta (Abeta) oligomers targeting the synapses. Some individuals, however, escape cognitive decline despite the presence of the neuropathologic features of AD (Abeta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles). We term this group Non-Demented with AD Neuropathology or NDAN. The present study illustrates one putative resistance mechanism involved in NDAN cases which may suggest targets for the effective treatment of AD. RESULTS: Here we describe the localization of Abeta oligomers at the postsynapse in hippocampi from AD cases. Notably, however, we also found that while present in soluble fractions, Abeta oligomers are absent from hippocampal postsynapses in NDAN cases. In addition, levels of phosphorylated (active) CREB, a transcription factor important for synaptic plasticity, are normal in NDAN individuals, suggesting that their synapses are functionally intact. Analysis of Zn2+ showed that levels were increased in both soluble fractions and synaptic vesicles in AD hippocampi, paralleled by a decrease of expression of the synaptic vesicle Zn2+ transporter, ZnT3. Conversely, in NDAN individuals, levels of Zn2+ in soluble fractions were significantly lower than in AD, whereas in synaptic vesicles the levels of Zn2+ were similar to AD, but accompanied by preserved expression of the ZnT3. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data illustrate that despite substantial AD neuropathology, Abeta oligomers, and increased synaptic vesicle Zn2+, susceptible brain tissue in these aged NDAN individuals features, as compared to symptomatic AD subjects, significantly lower total Zn2+ levels and no association of Abeta oligomers with the postsynapse, which collectively may promote the maintenance of intact cognitive function.

22644857|t|Inhibitory effects of Glycyrrhizae radix and its active component, isoliquiritigenin, on Abeta(25-35)-induced neurotoxicity in cultured rat cortical neurons.
22644857|a|This study investigated an ethanol extract from Glycyrrhizae radix (GR), the root of Glycyrrhiza uralensis (Leguminosae), for possible neuroprotective effects on neurotoxicity induced by amyloid beta protein (Abeta) (25-35) in cultured rat cortical neurons. Exposure of cultured cortical neurons to 10 muM Abeta (25-35) for 36 h induced neuronal apoptotic death. GR (10-50 mug/mL) prevented the Abeta (25-35)-induced neuronal apoptotic death, as assessed by a MTT assay and Hoechst 33342 staining. Furthermore, GR decreased the expression of Bax and active caspase-3, proapoptotic proteins, and increased Bcl-2, an antiapoptotic protein. GR also significantly inhibited Abeta (25-35)-induced elevation of the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) measured by fluorescent dyes. Isoliquiritigenin (1-20 muM), isolated from GR as an active component, inhibited Abeta (25-35)-induced neuronal apoptotic death, elevation of [Ca(2+)](i), ROS generation, and the change of apoptosis-associated proteins in cultured cortical neurons, suggesting that the neuroprotective effect of GR may be, at least partly, attributable to this compound. These results suggest that GR and isoliquiritigenin prevent Abeta (25-35)-induced neuronal apoptotic death by interfering with the increases of [Ca(2+)](i) and ROS, and GR may have a possible therapeutic role for preventing the progression of neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer's disease.

22645310|t|Prolyl isomerase Pin1 regulates neuronal differentiation via beta-catenin.
22645310|a|The Wnt/beta-catenin pathway promotes proliferation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) at early stages and induces neuronal differentiation from NPCs at late stages, but the molecular mechanisms that control this stage-specific response are unclear. Pin1 is a prolyl isomerase that regulates cell signaling uniquely by controlling protein conformation after phosphorylation, but its role in neuronal differentiation is not known. Here we found that whereas Pin1 depletion suppresses neuronal differentiation, Pin1 overexpression enhances it, without any effects on gliogenesis from NPCs in vitro. Consequently, Pin1-null mice have significantly fewer upper layer neurons in the motor cortex and severely impaired motor activity during the neonatal stage. A proteomic approach identified beta-catenin as a major substrate for Pin1 in NPCs, in which Pin1 stabilizes beta-catenin. As a result, Pin1 knockout leads to reduced beta-catenin during differentiation but not proliferation of NPCs in developing brains. Importantly, defective neuronal differentiation in Pin1 knockout NPCs is fully rescued in vitro by overexpression of beta-catenin but not a beta-catenin mutant that fails to act as a Pin1 substrate. These results show that Pin1 is a novel regulator of NPC differentiation by acting on beta-catenin and provides a new postphosphorylation signaling mechanism to regulate developmental stage-specific functioning of beta-catenin signaling in neuronal differentiation.

22646481|t|Alzheimer's disease, beta-amyloid, glutamate, NMDA receptors and memantine--searching for the connections.
22646481|a|beta-amyloid (Abeta) is widely accepted to be one of the major pathomechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD), although there is presently lively debate regarding the relative roles of particular species/forms of this peptide. Most recent evidence indicates that soluble oligomers rather than plaques are the major cause of synaptic dysfunction and ultimately neurodegeneration. Soluble oligomeric Abeta has been shown to interact with several proteins, for example glutamatergic receptors of the NMDA type and proteins responsible for maintaining glutamate homeostasis such as uptake and release. As NMDA receptors are critically involved in neuronal plasticity including learning and memory, we felt that it would be valuable to provide an up to date review of the evidence connecting Abeta to these receptors and related neuronal plasticity. Strong support for the clinical relevance of such interactions is provided by the NMDA receptor antagonist memantine. This substance is the only NMDA receptor antagonist used clinically in the treatment of AD and therefore offers an excellent tool to facilitate translational extrapolations from in vitro studies through in vivo animal experiments to its ultimate clinical utility.

22647259|t|Additive microglia-mediated neuronal injury caused by amyloid-beta and bacterial TLR agonists in murine neuron-microglia co-cultures quantified by an automated image analysis using cognition network technology.
22647259|a|Activated microglia is considered to be involved in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated the effect of amyloid-beta(1-40) (Abeta(40) and exogenous agonists of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 1/2 (Pam(3)CSK(4)) and TLR4 (LPS) on neurons in primary murine neuron-microglia co-cultures. Neuronal viability, assessed by quantifying the number of intact neuronal extensions and their crossings using a newly developed Definiens Cognition Network Technology-based method, was significantly decreased after treatment with Pam(3)CSK(4), LPS, and Abeta(40). Combined treatment with Abeta(40) and Pam(3)CSK(4) or LPS had an additive effect. Hence, in patients with AD, synergistic microglial activation by Abeta and bacterial products during infections might contribute to disease progression.

22647260|t|Astrocytic adenosine A2A receptors control the amyloid-beta peptide-induced decrease of glutamate uptake.
22647260|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a progressive cognitive impairment tightly correlated with the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides (mainly Abeta(1-42)). There is a precocious disruption of glutamatergic synapses in AD, in line with an ability of Abeta to decrease astrocytic glutamate uptake. Accumulating evidence indicates that caffeine prevents the burden of AD, likely through the antagonism of A(2A) receptors (A(2A)R) which attenuates Abeta-induced memory impairment and synaptotoxicity. Since A(2A)R also modulate astrocytic glutamate uptake, we now tested if A(2A)R blockade could prevent the decrease of astrocytic glutamate uptake caused by Abeta. In cultured astrocytes, Abeta(1-42). (1 muM for 24 hours) triggered an astrogliosis typified by an increased density of GFAP, which was mimicked by the A(2A)R agonist, CGS 26180 (30 nM), and prevented by the A(2A)R antagonist, SCH 58261 (100 nM). Abeta1-42 also decreased D-aspartate uptake by 28 +- 4%, an effect abrogated upon genetic inactivation or pharmacological blockade of A(2A)R. In accordance with the long term control of glutamate transporter expression by A(2A)R, Abeta(1-42). enhanced the expression and density of astrocytic A(2A)R and decreased GLAST and GLT-I expression in astrocytes from wild type, but not from A(2A)R knockout mice. This impact of Abeta(1-42). on glutamate transporters and uptake, dependent on A(2A)R function, was also confirmed in an ex vivo astrocyte preparation (gliosomes) from rats intracerebroventricularly (icv) injected with Abeta(1-42). . These results provide the first demonstration for a direct key role of astrocytic A(2A)R in the ability of Abeta-induced impairment of glutamate uptake, which may underlie glutamatergic synaptic dysfunction and excitotoxicity in AD.

22650238|t|Modulating metals as a therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease.
22650238|a|In 1906, Alois Alzheimer first characterized the disease that bears his name. Despite intensive research, which has led to a better understanding of the pathology, there is no effective treatment for this disease. Of the drugs approved by the US FDA, none are disease modifying, only symptomatic. Unfortunately, there have been a number of failed clinical trials in the past 10 years where studies show either no cognitive improvement or, worse, serious side effects associated with treatment. Hence, there is a need for the field to look at alternative approaches to therapy. In this review, we will discuss how metal dyshomeostasis occurs in aging and Alzheimer's disease. Concomitantly, we will discuss how targeting this dyshomeostasis offers an effective and novel therapeutic approach. Thus far, compounds that mediate these effects have shown great potential in both preclinical animal studies as well as in early-stage clinical trials.

22652052|t|Synthesis and biological evaluation of novel technetium-99m labeled phenylbenzoxazole derivatives as potential imaging probes for beta-amyloid plaques in brain.
22652052|a|Two uncharged (99m)Tc-labeled phenylbenzoxazole derivatives were biologically evaluated as potential imaging probes for beta-amyloid plaques. The (99m)Tc and corresponding rhenium complexes were synthesized by coupling monoamine-monoamide dithiol (MAMA) and bis(aminoethanethiol) (BAT) chelating ligand via a pentyloxy spacer to phenylbenzoxazole. The fluorescent rhenium complexes 6 and 9 selectively stainined the beta-amyloid plaques on the sections of transgenic mouse, and showed high affinity for Abeta((1-42)) aggregates (K(i)=11.1 nM and 14.3 nM, respectively). Autoradiography in vitro indicated that [(99m)Tc]6 clearly labeled beta-amyloid plaques on the sections of transgenic mouse. Biodistribution experiments in normal mice revealed that [(99m)Tc]6 displayed moderate initial brain uptake (0.81% ID/g at 2 min), and quickly washed out from the brain (0.25% ID/g at 60 min). The preliminary results indicate that the properties of [(99m)Tc]6 are promising, although additional refinements are needed to improve the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier.

22653657|t|Immunomodulatory therapies delay disease progression in multiple sclerosis.
22653657|a|BACKGROUND: Few studies have analysed long-term effects of immunomodulatory disease modifying drugs (DMDs). OBJECTIVE: Assessment of the efficacy of DMDs on long-term evolution of multiple sclerosis, using a Bayesian approach to overcome methodological problems related to open-label studies. METHODS: MS patients from three different Italian multiple sclerosis centres were divided into subgroups according to the presence of treatment in their disease history before the endpoint, which was represented by secondary progression. Patients were stratified on the basis of the risk score BREMS (Bayesian risk estimate for multiple sclerosis), which is able to predict the unfavourable long-term evolution of MS at an early stage. RESULTS: We analysed data from 1178 patients with a relapsing form of multiple sclerosis at onset and at least 10 years of disease duration, treated (59%) or untreated with DMDs. The risk of secondary progression was significantly lower in patients treated with DMDs, regardless of the initial prognosis predicted by BREMS. CONCLUSIONS: DMDs significantly reduce the risk of multiple sclerosis progression both in patients with initial high-risk and patients with initial low-risk. These findings reinforce the role of DMDs in modifying the natural course of the disease, suggesting that they have a positive effect not only on the inflammatory but also on the neurodegenerative process. The study also confirms the capability of the BREMS score to predict MS evolution.

22654059|t|The amyloid precursor protein has a flexible transmembrane domain and binds cholesterol.
22654059|a|C99 is the transmembrane carboxyl-terminal domain of the amyloid precursor protein that is cleaved by gamma-secretase to release the amyloid-beta polypeptides, which are associated with Alzheimer's disease. Nuclear magnetic resonance and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy show that the extracellular amino terminus of C99 includes a surface-embedded "N-helix" followed by a short "N-loop" connecting to the transmembrane domain (TMD). The TMD is a flexibly curved alpha helix, making it well suited for processive cleavage by gamma-secretase. Titration of C99 reveals a binding site for cholesterol, providing mechanistic insight into how cholesterol promotes amyloidogenesis. Membrane-buried GXXXG motifs (G, Gly; X, any amino acid), which have an established role in oligomerization, were also shown to play a key role in cholesterol binding. The structure and cholesterol binding properties of C99 may aid in the design of Alzheimer's therapeutics.

22654105|t|Nuclear factor-kappaB regulates betaAPP and beta- and gamma-secretases differently at physiological and supraphysiological Abeta concentrations.
22654105|a|Anatomical lesions in Alzheimer disease-affected brains mainly consist of senile plaques, inflammation stigmata, and oxidative stress. The nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) is a stress-activated transcription factor that is activated around senile plaques. We have assessed whether NF-kappaB could be differentially regulated at physiological or supraphysiological levels of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides. Under these experimental conditions, we delineated the putative NF-kappaB-dependent modulation of all cellular participants in Abeta production, namely its precursor betaAPP (beta-amyloid precursor protein) and the beta- and gamma-secretases, the two enzymatic machines involved in Abeta genesis. Under physiological conditions, NF-kappaB lowers the transcriptional activity of the promoters of betaAPP, beta-secretase (beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1, BACE1), and of the four protein components (Aph-1, Pen-2, nicastrin, presenilin-1, or presenilin-2) of the gamma-secretase in HEK293 cells. This was accompanied by a reduction of both protein levels and enzymatic activities, thereby ultimately yielding lower amounts of Abeta and AICD (APP intracellular domain). In stably transfected Swedish betaAPP-expressing HEK293 cells triggering supraphysiological concentrations of Abeta peptides, NF-kappaB activates the transcription of betaAPP, BACE1, and some of the gamma-secretase members and increases protein expression and enzymatic activities, resulting in enhanced Abeta production. Our pharmacological approach using distinct NF-kappaB kinase modulators indicates that both NF-kappaB canonical and alternative pathways are involved in the control of Abeta production. Overall, our data demonstrate that under physiological conditions, NF-kappaB triggers a repressive effect on Abeta production that contributes to maintaining its homeostasis, while NF-kappaB participates in a degenerative cycle where Abeta would feed its own production under pathological conditions.

To fill this research gap, this study immunocytochemically investigated the intracellular localization of APP in the neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-SH and in normal primary cells. Using antibodies against the amino-terminal portion of the APP molecule, immunoreactivity was detected not only in the cytoplasm but also in the nucleus and nucleolus. Further analysis revealed the co-localization of amino acids 44-63 of the APP molecule with fibrillarin, a nucleolus marker. These findings indicate that a fraction of APP, including its amino-terminal portion, may be localized in the nucleus as well as in the nucleolus, suggesting an important role of APP in RNA metabolism and other intra-nucleolus functions.

22661126|t|Object recognition as a measure of memory in 1-2 years old transgenic minipigs carrying the APPsw mutation for Alzheimer's disease.
22661126|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a disabling, fatal disease, where animal models potentially can enable investigation of aetiology and treatment. The first litter of Gottingen minipigs carrying a mutation for human AD was born in 2007, showing transgene expression. In human AD patients, memory impairment is the most striking and consistent feature. The aim of the present study was to examine effects of the APPsw transgene on memory of AD minipigs compared with non-transgenic controls at two ages (1-2 years) using the spontaneous object recognition test (SORT), which is based on behavioural discrimination of familiar and novel objects. No significant difference between AD minipigs and controls was found when comparing object recognition as a measure of memory. The minipigs did explore the novel object significantly more than the familiar, indicating the expected recognition of the familiar object. Two different inter-phase intervals were used (IPI: 10-40 min). For both ages, object recognition was evident using 10 min IPI. When using 40 min IPI, object recognition was evident only at age 1 year. Comparing memory of a relatively small group of AD minipigs and controls at two rather young ages using the SORT, we were not able to show memory impairment in APPsw carrying minipigs. Being an age-dependent disease, the transgene is expected to cause AD-like symptoms in this porcine model, and the SORT should be repeated at older ages.

22663067|t|Liberation of copper from amyloid plaques: making a risk factor useful for Alzheimer's disease treatment.
22663067|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex multifactorial syndrome. Metal chelator and Abeta inhibitor are showing promise against AD. In this report, three small hybrid compounds (1, 2, and 3) have been designed and synthesized utilizing salicylaldehyde (SA) based Schiff bases as the chelators and benzothiazole (BT) as the recognition moiety for AD treatment. These conjugates can capture Cu(2+) from Abeta and become dimers upon Cu(2+) coordination and show high efficiency for both Cu(2+) elimination and Abeta assembly inhibition. Besides, the complexes have superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and significant antioxidant capacity and are capable of decreasing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increasing cell viability. All these results indicate that the multifunctional metal complexes which have Abeta specific recognition moiety and metal ion chelating elements show the potential for AD treatment. Therefore, our work will provide new insights into exploration of more potent amyloid inhibitors.

22670059|t|Identification of beta-amyloid-binding sites on transthyretin.
22670059|a|Transthyretin (TTR) binds to the Alzheimer-related peptide beta-amyloid (Abeta), and may protect against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. In this work, the specific domains on TTR involved with binding to Abeta were probed. An array was constructed of peptides derived from overlapping sequences from TTR. Strong binding of Abeta to TIAALLSPYSYS (residues 106-117) was detected, corresponding to strand G on the inner beta-sheet of TTR. Abeta bound weakly to four contiguous peptides spanning residues 59-83, which includes strand E through the E/F helix and loop. To further pinpoint specific residues on TTR involved with Abeta binding, nine alanine mutants were generated: I68A, I73A, K76A, L82A, I84A, S85A, L17A, T106A and L110A. Abeta binding was significantly inhibited only in L82A and L110A, indicating that Abeta binding to TTR is mediated through these bulky hydrophobic leucines. Abeta binding to L17A and S85A was significantly higher than to wild-type TTR. Enhancement of binding in L17A is postulated to arise from reduced steric restriction to the interior L110 site, since these two residues are adjacent in the native protein. The S85A mutation caused a reduction in TTR tetramer stability; increased Abeta binding is postulated to be a direct consequence of the reduced quaternary stability.

22674261|t|Neurotoxicity and memory deficits induced by soluble low-molecular-weight amyloid-beta1-42 oligomers are revealed in vivo by using a novel animal model.
22674261|a|Neuronal and synaptic degeneration are the best pathological correlates for memory decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although the accumulation of soluble low-molecular-weight amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers has been suggested to trigger neurodegeneration in AD, animal models overexpressing or infused with Abeta lack neuronal loss at the onset of memory deficits. Using a novel in vivo approach, we found that repeated hippocampal injections of small soluble Abeta(1-42) oligomers in awake, freely moving mice were able to induce marked neuronal loss, tau hyperphosphorylation, and deficits in hippocampus-dependent memory. The neurotoxicity of small Abeta(1-42) species was observed in vivo as well as in vitro in association with increased caspase-3 activity and reduced levels of the NMDA receptor subunit NR2B. We found that the sequestering agent transthyretin is able to bind the toxic Abeta(1-42) species and attenuated the loss of neurons and memory deficits. Our novel mouse model provides evidence that small, soluble Abeta(1-42) oligomers are able to induce extensive neuronal loss in vivo and initiate a cascade of events that mimic the key neuropathological hallmarks of AD.

22674275|t|Synaptic plasticity defect following visual deprivation in Alzheimer's disease model transgenic mice.
22674275|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced changes in synaptic function in experimental models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggest that Abeta generation and accumulation may affect fundamental mechanisms of synaptic plasticity. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of APP overexpression on a well characterized, in vivo, developmental model of systems-level plasticity, ocular dominance plasticity. Following monocular visual deprivation during the critical period, mice that express mutant alleles of amyloid precursor protein (APPswe) and Presenilin1 (PS1dE9), as well as mice that express APPswe alone, lack ocular dominance plasticity in visual cortex. Defects in the spatial extent and magnitude of the plastic response are evident using two complementary approaches, Arc induction and optical imaging of intrinsic signals in awake mice. This defect in a classic paradigm of systems level synaptic plasticity shows that Abeta overexpression, even early in postnatal life, can perturb plasticity in cerebral cortex, and supports the idea that decreased synaptic plasticity due to elevated Abeta exposure contributes to cognitive impairment in AD.

22674434|t|Structures and free energy landscapes of aqueous zinc(II)-bound amyloid-beta(1-40) and zinc(II)-bound amyloid-beta(1-42) with dynamics.
22674434|a|Binding of divalent metal ions with intrinsically disordered fibrillogenic proteins, such as amyloid-beta (Abeta), influences the aggregation process and the severity of neurodegenerative diseases. The Abeta monomers and oligomers are the building blocks of the aggregates. In this work, we report the structures and free energy landscapes of the monomeric zinc(II)-bound Abeta40 (Zn:Abeta40) and zinc(II)-bound Abeta42 (Zn:Abeta42) intrinsically disordered fibrillogenic metallopeptides in an aqueous solution by utilizing an approach that employs first principles calculations and parallel tempering molecular dynamics simulations. The structural and thermodynamic properties, including the secondary and tertiary structures and conformational Gibbs free energies of these intrinsically disordered metallopeptide alloforms, are presented. The results show distinct differing characteristics for these metallopeptides. For example, prominent beta-sheet formation in the N-terminal region (Asp1, Arg5, and Tyr10) of Zn:Abeta40 is significantly decreased or lacking in Zn:Abeta42. Our findings indicate that blocking multiple reactive residues forming abundant beta-sheet structure located in the central hydrophobic core and C-terminal regions of Zn:Abeta42 via antibodies or small organic molecules might help to reduce the aggregation of Zn(II)-bound Abeta42. Furthermore, we find that helix formation increases but beta-sheet formation decreases in the C-terminal region upon Zn(II) binding to Abeta. This depressed beta-sheet formation in the C-terminal region (Gly33-Gly38) in monomeric Zn:Abeta42 might be linked to the formation of amorphous instead of fibrillar aggregates of Zn:Abeta42.

22675658|t|Biochemistry of amyloid beta-protein and amyloid deposits in Alzheimer disease.
22675658|a|Progressive cerebral deposition of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) in brain regions serving memory and cognition is an invariant and defining feature of Alzheimer disease. A highly similar but less robust process accompanies brain aging in many nondemented humans, lower primates, and some other mammals. The discovery of Abeta as the subunit of the amyloid fibrils in meningocerebral blood vessels and parenchymal plaques has led to innumerable studies of its biochemistry and potential cytotoxic properties. Here we will review the discovery of Abeta, numerous aspects of its complex biochemistry, and current attempts to understand how a range of Abeta assemblies, including soluble oligomers and insoluble fibrils, may precipitate and promote neuronal and glial alterations that underlie the development of dementia. Although the role of Abeta as a key molecular factor in the etiology of Alzheimer disease remains controversial, clinical trials of amyloid-lowering agents, reviewed elsewhere in this book, are poised to resolve the question of its pathogenic primacy.

22676466|a|The purpose of this randomized pilot study is to conduct an intervention with 68 rural women living with AIDS to compare the effectiveness of two different programs on depressive symptoms. The trial was designed to assess the impact of the Asha-Life intervention engaging with an HIV-trained village woman, Asha (Accredited Social Health Activist), to participate in the care of women living with AIDS (WLA), along with other health care providers compared to a Usual Care group. Two high prevalence HIV/AIDS villages in rural Andhra Pradesh, which were demographically alike and served by distinct Public Health Centers, were selected randomly from a total of 16 villages. The findings of this study demonstrated that the Asha-Life participants significantly reduced their depressive symptom scores compared to the Usual Care participants. Moreover, women living with AIDS who demonstrated higher depressive symptom scores at baseline had greater reduction in their depressive symptoms than women with lower scores.

22676717|t|Administration of COG1410 reduces axonal amyloid precursor protein immunoreactivity and microglial activation after controlled cortical impact in mice.
22676717|a|Traumatic axonal injury (TAI) accounts for at least 35% of the morbidity and mortality in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients without space-occupying lesions. It is also believed to be a key determinant of adverse outcomes such as cognitive dysfunction across the spectrum of TBI severity. Previous studies have shown that COG1410, a synthetic peptide derived from the apolipoprotein E (apoE) receptor binding region, has anti-inflammatory effects after experimental TBI, with improvements in cognitive recovery. However, the effects of COG1410 on axonal injury following TBI are not known. The current study evaluated the effects of 1 mg/kg daily COG1410 versus saline administered intravenously starting 30 min after controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury on pericontusional TAI in young, wild-type C57BL6/J male mice. We found that COG1410 did not affect the number of amyloid precursor protein (APP)-immunoreactive axonal varicosities in the pericontusional corpus callosum and external capsule at 24 h, but reduced APP-immunoreactive varicosities by 31% at 3 days (p=0.0023), and 36% at 7 days (p=0.0009). COG1410 significantly reduced the number of Iba1-positive cells with activated microglial morphology at all three time points by 21-30%. There was no effect of COG1410 on pericontusional white matter volume or silver staining at any time point. This indicates a possible effect of COG1410 on delayed but not immediate TAI. Future studies are needed to investigate the underlying mechanisms, therapeutic time window, and physiological implications of this effect.

22677258|t|Safety, tolerability, and antibody response of active Abeta immunotherapy with CAD106 in patients with Alzheimer's disease: randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, first-in-human study.
22677258|a|BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy targeting the amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide is a potential strategy to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease. We aimed to assess the safety and tolerability of CAD106, a novel active Abeta immunotherapy for patients with Alzheimer's disease, designed to induce N-terminal Abeta-specific antibodies without an Abeta-specific T-cell response. METHODS: We did a phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 52-week study in two centres in Sweden. Participants, aged 50-80 years, with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease were entered into one of two cohorts according to time of study entry and then randomly allocated (by use of a computer-generated randomisation sequence) to receive either CAD106 or placebo (4:1; cohort one received CAD106 50 mug or placebo, cohort two received CAD106 150 mug or placebo). Each patient received three subcutaneous injections. All patients, caregivers, and investigators were masked to treatment allocation throughout the study. Primary objectives were to assess the safety and tolerability of CAD106 and to identify the Abeta-specific antibody response. Safety assessment was done by recording of all adverse events, assessment of MRI scans, physical and neurological examinations, vital signs, electrocardiography, electroencephalography, and laboratory analysis of blood and CSF. Patients with Abeta-IgG serum titres higher than 16 units at least once during the study were classified as responders. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00411580. FINDINGS: Between August, 2005, and March, 2007, we randomly allocated 31 patients into cohort one (24 patients to CAD106 treatment and seven to placebo) and 27 patients into cohort two (22 patients to CAD106 treatment and five to placebo). 56 of 58 patients reported adverse events. In cohort one, nasopharyngitis was the most commonly reported adverse event (10 of 24 CAD106-treated patients). In cohort two, injection site erythema was the most commonly reported adverse event (14 of 22 CAD106-treated patients). Overall, nine patients reported serious adverse events--none was thought to be related to the study drug. We recorded no clinical or subclinical cases of meningoencephalitis. 16 of 24 (67%) CAD106-treated patients in cohort one and 18 of 22 (82%) in cohort two developed Abeta antibody response meeting pre-specified responder threshold. One of 12 placebo-treated patients (8%) had Abeta-IgG concentrations that qualified them as a responder. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that CAD106 has a favourable safety profile and acceptable antibody response in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Larger trials with additional dose investigations are needed to confirm the safety and establish the efficacy of CAD106. FUNDING: Novartis Pharma AG.

22678056|t|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) contributes to pathology in the SOD1(G93A) mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
22678056|a|In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the progressive loss of motor neurons is accompanied by extensive muscle denervation, resulting in paralysis and ultimately death. Upregulation of amyloid beta (A4) precursor protein (APP) in muscle fibres coincides with symptom onset in both sporadic ALS patients and the SOD1(G93A) mouse model of familial ALS. We have further characterized this response in SOD1(G93A) mice and also revealed elevated levels of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides in the SOD1(G93A) spinal cord, which were predominantly localized within motor neurons and their surrounding glial cells. We therefore examined the effect of genetic ablation of APP on disease progression in SOD1(G93A) mice, which significantly improved multiple disease parameters, including innervation, motor function, muscle contractile characteristics, motor unit and motor neuron survival. These results therefore strongly suggest that APP actively contributes to SOD1(G93A)-mediated pathology. Together with observations from ALS cases, this study indicates that APP may contribute to human ALS pathology.

22686127|t|Comparison of acrylic and titanium cranioplasty.
22686127|a|INTRODUCTION: There are many indications for cranioplasty with an increasing incidence partly attributable to an increase in decompressive craniectomy following trauma and stroke. The aim of this study was to compare the survival of acrylic and titanium cranioplasties used in our department. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of 126 patients who underwent cranioplasty between 1997 and 2007. A comparison was made between those with acrylic (n = 61) and titanium (n = 65) cranioplasties. There was no significant difference in age and length of time between craniectomy and cranioplasty between the two groups. The indications for titanium cranioplasty tended to be classified as 'high risk' indications including trauma and stroke. A higher rate of pre-existing infection was noted in the acrylic group. Mean follow-up was 97.2 and 34 months for acrylic and titanium cranioplasties respectively. RESULTS: Mean survival (95% confidence intervals) was 135 months (134-153) and 92 months (82-102) for acrylic and cranioplasty respectively. Out of 13 failures, only two were associated with pre-existing infection. Overall cumulative survival was better for acrylic cranioplasty although this difference did not reach statistical significance. DISCUSSION: Although survival of acrylic cranioplasty appears to be better than titanium plates, there is no statistical significance. Acrylic has the advantage of being able to be applied at the time of surgery without any planning and does not cause artefact on future imaging. Titanium cranioplasty is strong, light-weight and inert and can be fashioned in the pre-operative setting.

22688056|t|Calpain inhibitor A-705253 mitigates Alzheimer's disease-like pathology and cognitive decline in aged 3xTgAD mice.
22688056|a|Calpains are cysteine proteinases that selectively cleave proteins in response to calcium signals. Exacerbated activation of calpain has been implicated as a major component in the signaling cascade that leads to beta-amyloid (Abeta) production and tau hyperphosphorylation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we analyzed the potential therapeutic efficacy of inhibiting the activation of calpain by a novel calpain inhibitor in aged 3xTgAD mice with well-established cognitive impairment, plaques, and tangles. The administration of a novel inhibitor of calpain, A-705253, attenuated cognitive impairment and synaptic dysfunction in a dose-dependent manner in 3xTgAD mice. Inhibition of calpain lowered Abeta(40) and Abeta(42) levels in both detergent-soluble and detergent-insoluble fractions and also reduced the total number and size of thioflavin S-positive fibrillar Abeta deposits. Mechanistically, these effects were, in part, explained by a down-regulation of beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) and an up-regulation of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) expression, which, in turn, contributed to reduced production and increased clearance of Abeta, respectively. Moreover, A-705253 decreased the activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) and thereby diminished the hyperphosphorylation of tau. Finally, blockage of calpain activation reduced the astrocytic and microglial responses associated with AD-like pathological characteristics in aged 3xTgAD mice. Our data provide relevant functional and molecular insights into the beneficial therapeutic effects of inhibiting calpain activation for the management of AD.

22688190|t|Active vaccination with ankyrin G reduces beta-amyloid pathology in APP transgenic mice.
22688190|a|Serum antibodies against amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) in humans with or without diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) indicate the possibility of immune responses against brain antigens. In an unbiased screening for antibodies directed against brain proteins, we found in AD patients high serum levels of antibodies against the neuronal cytoskeletal protein ankyrin G (ankG); these correlated with slower rates of cognitive decline. Neuronal expression of ankG was higher in AD brains than in nondemented age-matched healthy control subjects. AnkG was present in exosomal vesicles, and it accumulated in beta-amyloid plaques. Active immunization with ankG of arcAbeta transgenic mice reduced brain beta-amyloid pathology and increased brain levels of soluble Abeta(42). AnkG immunization induced a reduction in beta-amyloid pathology, also in Swedish transgenic mice(.) Anti-ankG monoclonal antibodies reduced Abeta-induced loss of dendritic spines in hippocampal ArcAbeta organotypic cultures. Together, these data established a role for ankG in the human adaptive immune response against resident brain proteins, and they show that ankG immunization reduces brain beta-amyloid and its related neuropathology.

22690789|t|The effect of curcumin on the stability of Abeta dimers.
22690789|a|Abeta oligomers are potential targets for the diagnosis and therapy of Alzheimer's disease (AD). On the other hand, the molecule curcumin has been shown to possess significant therapeutic potential in many areas. In this paper, we use all-atom explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations to study the effect of curcumin on the stability of Abeta amyloid protein oligomers. We observed that curcumin decreases the beta-sheet secondary structural content within the Abeta oligomers without reducing the contacts between the monomers. The breaking of the beta-sheet is found to be preceded by a deformation of the beta-sheet structure due to hydrophobic interaction from the nearby curcumin. Furthermore, the pi-stacking interaction between curcumin (keto ring and enol ring) and the aromatic residues of Abeta, which exists throughout the simulations, has also contributed to the diminishing of the beta-sheet structure. Our analysis of the underwrapped amide-carbonyl hydrogen bonds reveals several stable dehydrons of the oligomer, especially the dehydron pair 34L and 41I, which curcumin tends to hover over. We have examined the paths of curcumin on the Abeta proteins and determined the common routes where curcumin lingers as it traverses around the Abeta. In consequence, our study has provided a detailed interaction picture between curcumin and the Abeta oligomers.

22690944|t|Novel 18F-labeled benzoxazole derivatives as potential positron emission tomography probes for imaging of cerebral beta-amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease.
22690944|a|Two radiofluoro-pegylated phenylbenzoxazole derivatives, 4-(5-(2-(2-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)benzo[d]oxazol-2-yl)-N-methylaniline ([(18)F]24) and 4-(5-(2-(2-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)benzo[d]oxazol-2-yl)-N,N-dimethylaniline ([(18)F]32), were synthesized and evaluated as probes for imaging cerebral beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques in living brain tissue by PET. [(18)F]24 and [(18)F]32 displayed high affinity for Abeta(1-42) aggregates (K(i) = 9.3 and 3.9 nM, respectively). In vitro autoradiography with sections of post-mortem AD brain and transgenic mouse brain confirmed the affinity of these tracers. Initial high uptake into and rapid washout from the brain in normal mice were observed. [(18)F]24 also displayed excellent binding to Abeta plaques in ex vivo autoradiographic experiments with Tg2576 mice. Furthermore, small-animal PET studies demonstrated significant differences in the clearance profile after the administration of [(18)F]24 between Tg2576 and wild-type mice. The results suggest [(18)F]24 to be a useful PET agent for detecting Abeta plaques in the living human brain.

22692213|t|The neural cell adhesion molecules L1 and CHL1 are cleaved by BACE1 protease in vivo.
22692213|a|The beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme BACE1 is a prime drug target for Alzheimer disease. However, the function and the physiological substrates of BACE1 remain largely unknown. In this work, we took a quantitative proteomic approach to analyze the secretome of primary neurons after acute BACE1 inhibition, and we identified several novel substrate candidates for BACE1. Many of these molecules are involved in neuronal network formation in the developing nervous system. We selected the adhesion molecules L1 and CHL1, which are crucial for axonal guidance and maintenance of neural circuits, for further validation as BACE1 substrates. Using both genetic BACE1 knock-out and acute pharmacological BACE1 inhibition in mice and cell cultures, we show that L1 and CHL1 are cleaved by BACE1 under physiological conditions. The BACE1 cleavage sites at the membrane-proximal regions of L1 (between Tyr(1086) and Glu(1087)) and CHL1 (between Gln(1061) and Asp(1062)) were determined by mass spectrometry. This work provides molecular insights into the function and the pathways in which BACE1 is involved, and it will help to predict or interpret possible side effects of BACE1 inhibitor drugs in current clinical trials.

22696871|t|The protective effect of curcumin on Abeta induced aberrant cell cycle reentry on primary cultured rat cortical neurons.
22696871|a|OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by progressive loss of memory and impairment of cognitive ability. One current hypothesis for AD pathogenesis is that neuronal death is linked to aberrant cell-cycle re-entry. In AD, neurons have been shown to enter the cell cycle inappropriately without the ability to complete it fully and the aberrant re-entry leads to its death. Curcumin has been reported as having a neural protective effect on the AD model, and could modulate the proliferation of tumor cells through the regulation of cyclin D1 and c-myc cell signaling pathways. In this study, we first observed the protective action of curcumin on Abeta-induced neuron damage, and then investigated whether this protective effect was a result of the inhibition of cell cycle advance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used MTT assay and TUNEL assay to observe the effect of curcumin on Abeta-induced neuron death, and then examined the activated caspase-3 protein level to further confirm the protective effect of curcumin against Abeta-induced neuron toxicity. Next, we further investigate whether the inhibition of cell cycle reentry was mediated by the therapeutic effect of curcumin on Abeta induced primary cultured neuron damage by Brdu label assay and western blot assay. RESULTS: The results showed that administration of curcumin (1-10 microM) could inhibit Abeta25-35 (40 microg/ml) induced primary cultured rat cortical neuron death, down-regulating activated caspase-3 protein expression. Furthermore, treatment with curcumin could inhibit abnormal activated cyclin D1 protein level, and decrease the Brdu positive cells in proportion to the Abeta25-35 treatment neurons. CONCLUSIONS: All the results suggest that curcumin has a protective effect against Abeta-induced toxicity in cultured rat cortical neurons, the inhibition of cell cycle re-entry at least partly mediating the therapeutic effect of curcumin in the AD model in vitro.

22699449|t|Association between BDNF polymorphism (Val66Met) and executive function in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer disease.
22699449|a|BACKGROUND: In the present study, we examined whether brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) polymorphism (Val66Met) influenced the changeable executive dysfunction of patients with two separate disease stages: amnestic mild cognitive impairment (A-MCI) or mild Alzheimer disease (AD), which are comparatively similar demented conditions. METHODS: Among 200 outpatients with dementia and MCI, 146 outpatients with mild AD or A-MCI were recruited and divided into two genotypic groups, valine homozygosity (Val/Val) and methionine (Met) carriers, based on the representative BDNF functional polymorphism Val66Met. Next, we compared the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) total and subtest scores between the two genotypic groups according to each of two different disease stages: A-MCI (n = 42) and mild AD (n = 104). RESULTS: Among patients with only a mild stage of AD, the FAB total and go/no-go scores were significantly lower (p < 0.05) among the subjects with the Val/Val genotype than among the Met carriers. However, no significant differences in any other demographic variables were observed between the genotypes according to each of different disease stages. A significant interaction between Val66Met and age was not observed for the FAB scores. CONCLUSION: These results suggested that the BDNF gene may significantly influence executive dysfunction, including inhibition tasks, among patients with mild-stage AD.

22699906|t|Gender modulates the APOE epsilon4 effect in healthy older adults: convergent evidence from functional brain connectivity and spinal fluid tau levels.
22699906|a|We examined whether the effect of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype on functional brain connectivity is modulated by gender in healthy older human adults. Our results confirm significantly decreased connectivity in the default mode network in healthy older APOE epsilon4 carriers compared with epsilon3 homozygotes. More important, further testing revealed a significant interaction between APOE genotype and gender in the precuneus, a major default mode hub. Female epsilon4 carriers showed significantly reduced default mode connectivity compared with either female epsilon3 homozygotes or male epsilon4 carriers, whereas male epsilon4 carriers differed minimally from male epsilon3 homozygotes. An additional analysis in an independent sample of healthy elderly using an independent marker of Alzheimer's disease, i.e., spinal fluid levels of tau, provided corresponding evidence for this gender-by-APOE interaction. Together, these results converge with previous work showing a higher prevalence of the epsilon4 allele among women with Alzheimer's disease and, critically, demonstrate that this interaction between APOE genotype and gender is detectable in the preclinical period.

22700814|t|Low PiB PET retention in presence of pathologic CSF biomarkers in Arctic APP mutation carriers.
22700814|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the particular pathology of the Arctic APP (APParc) early-onset familial Alzheimer disease (eoFAD) mutation for the first time in vivo with PET in comparison with other eoFAD mutations and sporadic Alzheimer disease (sAD). METHODS: We examined 2 APParc mutation carriers together with 5 noncarrier siblings cross-sectionally with (11)C-labeled Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET, as well as MRI, CSF biomarkers, and neuropsychological tests. Likewise, we examined 7 patients with sAD, 1 carrier of a presenilin 1 (PSEN1) mutation, 1 carrier of the Swedish APP (APPswe) mutation, and 7 healthy controls (HCs). RESULTS: Cortical PiB retention was very low in the APParc mutation carriers while cerebral glucose metabolism and CSF levels of Abeta(1-42), total and phosphorylated tau were clearly pathologic. This was in contrast to the PSEN1 and APPswe mutation carriers revealing high PiB retention in the cortex and the striatum in combination with abnormal glucose metabolism and CSF biomarkers, and the patients with sAD who showed typically high cortical PiB retention and pathologic CSF levels as well as decreased glucose metabolism when compared with HCs. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of fibrillar beta-amyloid (Abeta) as visualized by PiB PET in APParc mutation carriers suggests, given the reduced glucose metabolism and levels of Abeta(1-42) in CSF, that other forms of Abeta such as oligomers and protofibrils are important for the pathologic processes leading to clinical Alzheimer disease.

Evidence of cell cycle activation in post-mitotic neurons has also been observed in murine models of AD, despite the fact that most of these mice do not show massive loss of neuronal bodies. Dysfunction of the cell cycle appears to affect cells other than neurons, as peripheral cells, such as lymphocytes and fibroblasts from patients with AD, show an altered response to mitogenic stimulation. We sought to determine whether cell cycle disturbances are present simultaneously in both brain and peripheral cells from the amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 1 (PS1) mouse model of AD, in order to validate the use of peripheral cells from patients not only to study cell cycle abnormalities as a pathogenic feature of AD, but also as a means to test novel therapeutic approaches. By using cell cycle pathway-specific RT(2)Profiler  PCR Arrays, we detected changes in a number of cell cycle-related genes in brain as well as in lymphocytes from APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, we found enhanced 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation into DNA in lymphocytes from APP/PS1 mice, and increased expression of the cell proliferation marker proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor Cdkn2a, as detected by immunohistochemistry in cortical neurons of the APP/PS1 mice. Taken together, the cell cycle-related changes in brain and blood cells reported here support the mitosis failure hypothesis in AD and validate the use of peripheral cells as surrogate tissue to study the molecular basis of AD pathogenesis.

22702727|t|Characterization of Abeta aggregation mechanism probed by congo red.
22702727|a|beta-Amyloid peptide (1) (Abeta) aggregates are toxic to neuron and the main cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The role of congo red (CR) on Abeta aggregation is controversial in aqueous solution. Both prevention and promotion of Abeta aggregation have been proposed, suggesting that CR may interact with Abeta of different structural conformations resulting in different effects on Abeta aggregation behavior. CR with these characteristics can be applied to probe the molecular mechanism of Abeta aggregation. Therefore, in the present study, we used CR as a probe to study the Abeta aggregation behavior in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) condition. Our results show that Abeta(40) adopts two short helices at Q15-S26 and K28-L34 in the SDS environment. CR can interact with the helical form of Abeta(40), and the main interaction site is located at the first helical and hydrophobic core region, residues 17-25, which is assigned as a discordant helix region. Furthermore, CR may prevent Abeta(40) undergoing alpha-helix to beta-strand conversion, and therefore aggregation through stabilizing the helical conformation of discordant helix in SDS environment, suggesting that the discordant helix plays a key role on the conformational stabilization of Abeta. Our present study implies that any factors or molecules that can stabilize the discordant helical conformation may also prevent the Abeta aggregation in membrane associated state. This leads to a new therapeutic strategy for the development of lead compounds to AD.

22702962|t|Phenotypical difference of amyloid precursor protein (APP) V717L mutation in Japanese family.
22702962|a|BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Mutations in genes such as those encoding amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 and presenilin 2, are responsible for early-onset familial AD. CASE PRESENTATION: In this study, we report a 275341 G > C (Val717Leu) mutation in the APP gene in a Japanese family with early onset AD by genetic screening. This mutation has previously been detected in European families. In the Japanese family we screened, the age at onset of AD was 47.1 +- 3.1 years old (n = 9; range, 42-52). The symptoms in the affected members included psychiatric vulnerability and focal signs such as pyramidal signs, epileptic seizures, and myoclonic discharges. An MR imaging study showed relatively mild atrophic changes in the bilateral hippocampus and cerebral cortices in all affected members compared with their clinical presentations. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the clinical features of Alzheimer's disease can be different even when caused by the same mutation in the APP gene. Further clinical and genetic studies are required to clarify the relationship between phenotypes and genotypes.

22704931|t|Plasma amyloid-beta oligomers level is a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.
22704931|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta), especially Abeta oligomers, is important in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. We studied plasma Abeta(40), Abeta(42), and Abeta oligomers levels in 44 AD patients and 22 non-demented controls. Cognitive functions were assessed by Chinese version of mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Abbreviated Metal Test (AMT), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog). Plasma Abeta monomers and oligomers levels were measured by ELISA. We found that the median plasma Abeta(40) and Abeta(42) levels were similar between AD and controls, and without significant correlation with cognition. Plasma Abeta oligomers level was higher in AD than controls (642.54 ng/ml [range 103.33-2676.93] versus 444.18 ng/ml [range 150.19-1311.18], p=0.047), and negatively correlated with cognition. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the highest tertile of Abeta oligomers levels showed an increased risk of AD than the combined group of middle and lowest tertiles (OR=8.85, p=0.013), after adjustment of gender, age and APOE4 genotype. Increased plasma Abeta oligomers level was associated with decreased MMSE and AMT scores (p=0.037, p=0.043, respectively) and increased ADAS-cog score (p=0.036), suggesting negative correlation with cognitive function. We concluded that plasma Abeta oligomers level is an useful biomarker for AD diagnosis.

22705206|t|Higher susceptibility to amyloid fibril formation of the recombinant ovine prion protein modified by transglutaminase.
22705206|a|Prion proteins are known as the main agents of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies affecting humans as well as animals. A recombinant ovine prion protein was found to be in vitro able to act as an effective substrate for a microbial isoform of transglutaminase, an enzyme catalyzing the formation of isopeptide bonds inside the proteins. We proved that transglutaminase modifies the structure of the prion protein by leading to the formation of three intra-molecular crosslinks and that the crosslinked protein form is more competent in amyloid formation compared to the unmodified one. In addition, the crosslinked prion protein was shown also to be more resistant to proteinase K digestion. Our findings suggest a possible use of transglutaminase in stabilizing the prion protein three-dimensional structure in order to investigate the molecular basis of the conversion of the protein into its pathological form.

22705750|t|Introducing Amylo-Glo, a novel fluorescent amyloid specific histochemical tracer especially suited for multiple labeling and large scale quantification studies.
22705750|a|One of the hallmark pathologies associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the conspicuous deposition of extracellular amyloid plaques within the forebrain. These plaques are primarily composed of fibrular aggregates of the A-beta peptide. Traditional methods for the histological localization of these plaques typically rely on the use of the tracers Congo Red or Thioflavin S. This study describes the characterization of a novel fluorescent histochemical probe, Amylo-Glo, for the high resolution and contrast localization of amyloid plaques in brain tissue sections. Potential advantages over conventional amyloid plaque stains such as Congo Red or Thioflavin S can be attributed to its unique chemical and spectral properties. Specifically, it results in a very bright blue UV excitable stain under physiological conditions that will not bleed through when illuminated with other filters. Its brightness makes it ideal for low magnification quantification studies, while its unique excitation/emission profile and mild staining conditions makes it ideal for combination with multiple immunofluorescent labeling studies.

22708832|t|beta-amyloid 1-42 induces physiological transcriptional regulation of BACE1.
22708832|a|The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is only partially understood. beta-amyloid (Abeta) is physiologically generated by sequential cleavage of its precursor protein by the beta- and the gamma-secretase and it is normally disposed of. In Alzheimer's disease, Abeta is excessively produced or less dismissed, but the hypothesis on its physiological and pathological role are heterogeneous and often discordant. It has been described a positive feedback loop from the gamma- to the beta-secretase cleavages of Abeta precursor protein, which is activated by mutations of Presenilin 1 (PS1), the catalytic core of the gamma-secretase. These findings show that Abeta precursor protein as well the activity of the gamma-secretase are required to obtain the up-regulation of beta-secretase which is induced by Presenilin 1 mutations. Then, Abeta 1-42 is the Abeta precursor protein derivative that up-regulates the expression of beta-secretase, and c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-Jun and ERK1/2 are involved. Here, we describe the activation of beta-secretase and c-jun N-terminal kinase related proteins by monomeric Abeta 1-42, defining the conditions that most efficiently strike the described signaling without producing toxicity. Taken together these data imply that monomeric Abeta 1-42, at non-toxic concentrations and time frames, are able to induce a signaling pathway that leads to transcriptional activation of beta-secretase.

22709431|t|Self-assembled monolayers of Abeta peptides on Au electrodes: an artificial platform for probing the reactivity of redox active metals and cofactors relevant to Alzheimer's disease.
22709431|a|The water-soluble hydrophilic part of human Abeta peptide has been extended to include a C-terminal cysteine residue. Utilizing the thiol functionality of this cysteine residue, self-assembled monolayers (SAM) of these peptides are formed on Au electrodes. Atomic force microscopy imaging confirms formation of small Abeta aggregates on the surface of the electrode. These aggregates bind redox active metals like Cu and cofactors like heme, both of which are proposed to generate toxic partially reduced oxygen species (PROS) and play a vital role in Alzheimer's disease. The spectroscopic and electrochemical properties of these Cu and heme bound Abeta SAM are similar to those reported for the soluble Cu and heme bound Abeta peptide. Experiments performed on these Abeta-SAM electrodes clearly demonstrate that (1) heme bound Abeta is kinetically more competent in reducing O(2) than Cu bound Abeta, (2) under physiological conditions the reduced Cu site produces twice as much PROS (measured in situ) than the reduced heme site, and (3) chelators like clioquinol remove Cu from these aggregates, while drugs like methylene blue inhibit O(2) reactivity of the heme cofactor. This artificial construct provides a very easy platform for investigating potential drugs affecting aggregation of human Abeta peptides and PROS generation by its complexes with redox active metals and cofactors.

22709576|t|Modulation of beta-amyloid aggregation by engineering the sequence connecting beta-strand forming domains.
22709576|a|Aggregation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) into oligomers and fibrils is associated with the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. The major structural characteristics of Abeta fibrils include the presence of beta sheet-loop-beta sheet conformations. Several lines of study suggested a potentially important role of the Abeta loop forming sequence (referred to as the Abeta linker region) in Abeta aggregation. Effects of mutations in several charged residues within the Abeta linker region on aggregation have been extensively studied. However, little is known about oligomerization effects of sequence variation in other residues within the Abeta linker region. Moreover, modulation effects of the Abeta linker mutants on Abeta aggregation have yet to be characterized. Here, we created and characterized Abeta linker variants containing sequences preferentially found in specific beta turn conformations. Our results indicate that a propensity to form oligomers may be changed by local sequence variation in the Abeta linker region without mutating the charged residues. Strikingly, one Abeta linker variant rapidly formed protofibrillar oligomers, which did not convert to fibrillar aggregates in contrast to Abeta aggregating to fibrils under similar incubation conditions. Moreover, our results suggest that molecular forces critical in oligomerization and fibrillization may differ at least for those involved in the linker region. When co-incubated with Abeta, some Abeta linker variants were found to induce accumulation of Abeta oligomers. Our results suggest that engineering of the Abeta linker region as described in this paper may represent a novel approach to control Abeta oligomerization and create Abeta oligomerization modulators.

22710357|t|Distinct patterns of antiamyloid-beta antibodies in typical and atypical Alzheimer disease.
22710357|a|OBJECTIVE: To compare serum antiamyloid-beta (Abeta) antibodies in typical and atypical Alzheimer disease (AD). DESIGN: Preliminary observations. SUBJECTS: Thirteen patients with AD, 8 patients with posterior cortical atrophy with evidence of AD (PCA-AD) pathophysiological process by both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and amyloid imaging, and 12 age-matched control individuals. INTERVENTIONS: The class and subclass levels of serum anti-Abeta antibodies were measured using an oligomer-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. This method allowed measuring both free antibodies and, after acidic treatment, the total fraction that includes all antibodies complexed with circulating Abeta40/42 and any cross-reacting antigen. RESULTS: Anti-Abeta IgG were restricted to the IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses. Their total levels were strikingly lower and more homogeneous in patients with PCA compared with both typical AD and controls, while biomarkers of amyloid deposition (CSF Abeta42 and positron emission tomography amyloid imaging) were similar in patients with AD and patients with PCA. CONCLUSIONS: Serum anti-Abeta IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies differ between distinct forms of AD. Its significance is discussed for possible implications as immune effectors in the specific pathophysiology of AD variants.

22711819|t|Purified and synthetic Alzheimer's amyloid beta (Abeta) prions.
22711819|a|The aggregation and deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides are believed to be central events in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Inoculation of brain homogenates containing Abeta aggregates into susceptible transgenic mice accelerated Abeta deposition, suggesting that Abeta aggregates are capable of self-propagation and hence might be prions. Recently, we demonstrated that Abeta deposition can be monitored in live mice using bioluminescence imaging (BLI). Here, we use BLI to probe the ability of Abeta aggregates to self-propagate following inoculation into bigenic mice. We report compelling evidence that Abeta aggregates are prions by demonstrating widespread cerebral beta-amyloidosis induced by inoculation of either purified Abeta aggregates derived from brain or aggregates composed of synthetic Abeta. Although synthetic Abeta aggregates were sufficient to induce Abeta deposition in vivo, they exhibited lower specific biological activity compared with brain-derived Abeta aggregates. Our results create an experimental paradigm that should lead to identification of self-propagating Abeta conformations, which could represent novel targets for interrupting the spread of Abeta deposition in AD patients.

22711829|t|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) traffics from the cell surface via endosomes for amyloid beta (Abeta) production in the trans-Golgi network.
22711829|a|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is processed sequentially by the beta-site APP cleaving enzyme and gamma-secretase to generate amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides, one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. The intracellular location of Abeta production-endosomes or the trans-Golgi network (TGN)-remains uncertain. We investigated the role of different postendocytic trafficking events in Abeta(40) production using an RNAi approach. Depletion of Hrs and Tsg101, acting early in the multivesicular body pathway, retained APP in early endosomes and reduced Abeta(40) production. Conversely, depletion of CHMP6 and VPS4, acting late in the pathway, rerouted endosomal APP to the TGN for enhanced APP processing. We found that VPS35 (retromer)-mediated APP recycling to the TGN was required for efficient Abeta(40) production. An interruption of the bidirectional trafficking of APP between the TGN and endosomes, particularly retromer-mediated retrieval of APP from early endosomes to the TGN, resulted in the accumulation of endocytosed APP in early endosomes with reduced APP processing. These data suggest that Abeta(40) is generated predominantly in the TGN, relying on an endocytosed pool of APP recycled from early endosomes to the TGN.

22714678|t|S-52, a novel nootropic compound, protects against beta-amyloid induced neuronal injury by attenuating mitochondrial dysfunction.
22714678|a|Accumulating evidence suggests that beta-amyloid (Abeta)-induced oxidative DNA damage and mitochondrial dysfunction may initiate and contribute to the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study evaluated the neuroprotective effects of S-52, a novel nootropic compound, on Abeta-induced mitochondrial failure. In an established paradigm of moderate cellular injury induced by Abeta, S-52 was observed to attenuate the toxicity of Abeta to energy metabolism, mitochondrial membrane structure, and key enzymes in the electron transport chain and tricarboxylic acid cycle. In addition, S-52 also effectively inhibited reactive oxygen species accumulation dose dependently not only in Abeta-harmed cells but also in unharmed, normal cells. The role of S-52 as a scavenger of free radicals is involved in the antioxidative effect of this compound. The beneficial effects on mitochondria and oxidative stress extend the neuroprotective effects of S-52. The present study provides crucial information for better understanding the beneficial profiles of this compound and discovering novel potential drug candidates for AD therapy.

22715062|t|Transforming growth factor-beta stimulates beta amyloid uptake by microglia through Smad3-dependent mechanisms.
22715062|a|Inflammatory cytokines and beta amyloid (Abeta) induce activation of glial cells, leading to both protective and deleterious changes that are relevant for the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD). We have shown that astrocytes downregulate microglial cell cytotoxic activation through secretion of transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta1), and there is evidence that TGFbeta1 modifies Abeta removal through the modulation of microglia. However, inflammatory activation of microglia is increased and Abeta clearance is reduced in AD patients, regardless of the fact that TGFbeta1 is increased in their nervous system. We propose that changes in TGFbeta Smad3 signal transduction could modify the regulation mediated by TGFbeta1. Here we evaluated the participation of the TGFbeta Smad3 pathway in regulation of the expression pattern of scavenger receptors (SR) and activation of microglia through nitric oxide (NO ) secretion and phagocytosis of Abeta. We found that TGFbeta1 increased SR-A by 2.4-fold and decreased SR-BI expression by 79% at 48 hr, whereas it did not change SR-MARCO or CD36 expression. In addition, we observed a 51% increase of Abeta uptake and an 83% decrease of NO  production induced by lipopolysaccharide in microglial cell cultures. Increased expression of SR-A, phagocytosis, and downregulation of NO  by TGFbeta1 were prevented by the inhibition of the TGFbeta Smad3 pathway. Our results indicate that the modulation of microglial cell activation by TGFbeta1, leading to increased clearance of Abeta and reduced cytotoxicity, is at least partially mediated by the Smad pathway.

22718756|t|Human serum albumin can regulate amyloid-beta peptide fiber growth in the brain interstitium: implications for Alzheimer disease.
22718756|a|Alzheimer disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by extracellular accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) in the brain interstitium. Human serum albumin (HSA) binds 95% of Abeta in blood plasma and is thought to inhibit plaque formation in peripheral tissue. However, the role of albumin in binding Abeta in the cerebrospinal fluid has been largely overlooked. Here we investigate the effect of HSA on both Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) fibril growth. We show that at micromolar cerebrospinal fluid levels, HSA inhibits the kinetics of Abeta fibrillization, significantly increasing the lag time and decreasing the total amount of fibrils produced. Furthermore, we show that the amount of amyloid fibers generated directly correlates to the proportion of Abeta not competitively bound to albumin. Our observations suggest a significant role for HSA regulating Abeta fibril growth in the brain interstitium.

22722202|t|Sequence analysis of mutations and translocations across breast cancer subtypes.
22722202|a|Breast carcinoma is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women worldwide, with an estimated 1.38 million new cases and 458,000 deaths in 2008 alone. This malignancy represents a heterogeneous group of tumours with characteristic molecular features, prognosis and responses to available therapy. Recurrent somatic alterations in breast cancer have been described, including mutations and copy number alterations, notably ERBB2 amplifications, the first successful therapy target defined by a genomic aberration. Previous DNA sequencing studies of breast cancer genomes have revealed additional candidate mutations and gene rearrangements. Here we report the whole-exome sequences of DNA from 103 human breast cancers of diverse subtypes from patients in Mexico and Vietnam compared to matched-normal DNA, together with whole-genome sequences of 22 breast cancer/normal pairs. Beyond confirming recurrent somatic mutations in PIK3CA, TP53, AKT1, GATA3 and MAP3K1, we discovered recurrent mutations in the CBFB transcription factor gene and deletions of its partner RUNX1. Furthermore, we have identified a recurrent MAGI3-AKT3 fusion enriched in triple-negative breast cancer lacking oestrogen and progesterone receptors and ERBB2 expression. The MAGI3-AKT3 fusion leads to constitutive activation of AKT kinase, which is abolished by treatment with an ATP-competitive AKT small-molecule inhibitor.

22722772|t|Characterization of the role of metallothionein-3 in an animal model of Alzheimer's disease.
22722772|a|Among the dementias, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most commonly diagnosed, but there are still no effective drugs available for its treatment. It has been suggested that metallothionein-3 (MT-3) could be somehow involved in the etiology of AD, and in fact very promising results have been found in in vitro studies, but the role of MT-3 in vivo needs further analysis. In this study, we analyzed the role of MT-3 in a mouse model of AD, Tg2576 mice, which overexpress human Amyloid Precursor Protein (hAPP) with the Swedish mutation. MT-3 deficiency partially rescued the APP-induced mortality of females, and mildly affected APP-induced changes in behavior assessed in the hole-board and plus-maze tests in a gender-dependent manner. Amyloid plaque burden and/or hAPP expression were decreased in the cortex and hippocampus of MT-3-deficient females. Interestingly, exogenously administered Zn(7)MT-3 increased soluble Abeta40 and Abeta42 and amyloid plaques and gliosis, particularly in the cortex, and changed several behavioral traits (increased deambulation and exploration and decreased anxiety). These results highlight that the control of the endogenous production and/or action of MT-3 could represent a powerful therapeutic target in AD.

22723704|t|A role for presenilins in autophagy revisited: normal acidification of lysosomes in cells lacking PSEN1 and PSEN2.
22723704|a|Presenilins 1 and 2 (PS1 and PS2) are the catalytic subunits of the gamma-secretase complex, and genes encoding mutant PS1 and PS2 variants cause familial forms of Alzheimer's disease. Lee et al. (2010) recently reported that loss of PS1 activity lead to impairments in autophagosomal function as a consequence of lysosomal alkalinization, caused by failed maturation of the proton translocating V0a1 subunit of the vacuolar (H+)-ATPase and targeting to the lysosome. We have reexamined these issues in mammalian cells and in brains of mice lacking PS (PScdko) and have been unable to find evidence that the turnover of autophagic substrates, vesicle pH, V0a1 maturation, or lysosome function is altered compared with wild-type counterparts. Collectively, our studies fail to document a role for presenilins in regulating cellular autophagosomal function. On the other hand, our transcriptome studies of PScdko mouse brains reveal, for the first time, a role for PS in regulating lysosomal biogenesis.

22723742|t|Small heat shock proteins potentiate amyloid dissolution by protein disaggregases from yeast and humans.
22723742|a|How small heat shock proteins (sHsps) might empower proteostasis networks to control beneficial prions or disassemble pathological amyloid is unknown. Here, we establish that yeast sHsps, Hsp26 and Hsp42, inhibit prionogenesis by the [PSI+] prion protein, Sup35, via distinct and synergistic mechanisms. Hsp42 prevents conformational rearrangements within molten oligomers that enable de novo prionogenesis and collaborates with Hsp70 to attenuate self-templating. By contrast, Hsp26 inhibits self-templating upon binding assembled prions. sHsp binding destabilizes Sup35 prions and promotes their disaggregation by Hsp104, Hsp70, and Hsp40. In yeast, Hsp26 or Hsp42 overexpression prevents [PSI+] induction, cures [PSI+], and potentiates [PSI+]-curing by Hsp104 overexpression. In vitro, sHsps enhance Hsp104-catalyzed disaggregation of pathological amyloid forms of alpha-synuclein and polyglutamine. Unexpectedly, in the absence of Hsp104, sHsps promote an unprecedented, gradual depolymerization of Sup35 prions by Hsp110, Hsp70, and Hsp40. This unanticipated amyloid-depolymerase activity is conserved from yeast to humans, which lack Hsp104 orthologues. A human sHsp, HspB5, stimulates depolymerization of alpha-synuclein amyloid by human Hsp110, Hsp70, and Hsp40. Thus, we elucidate a heretofore-unrecognized human amyloid-depolymerase system that could have applications in various neurodegenerative disorders.

22724381|t|Photocontrol of reversible amyloid formation with a minimal-design peptide.
22724381|a|Amyloid aggregates are highly ordered fibrillar assemblies of polypeptides involved in a number of neurodegenerative diseases. Very little is known on the pathways of self-assembly of peptides into the final amyloid fibrils, which is due in part to the difficulty of triggering the aggregation process in a controlled manner. Here we present the design and validation of a cross-linked hexapeptide that reversibly aggregates and dissociates under ultraviolet light irradiation control. First molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to identify, among hundreds of possible sequences, those with the highest propensity to form ordered (beta-sheet) oligomers in the trans state of the azobenzene cross-linker, and at the same time with the highest solubility in the cis state. In the simulations, the peptides were observed to spontaneously form ordered oligomers with cross-beta contacts when the cross-linker was in the trans state, whereas in the cis state they self-assemble into amorphous aggregates. For the most promising sequence emerging from the simulations (Ac-Cys-His-Gly-Gln-Cys-Lys-NH(2) cross-linked at the two cysteine residues), the photoisomerization of the azobenzene group was shown to induce reversible aggregation by time-resolved light scattering and fluorescence measurements. The amyloid-like fibrillar topology was confirmed by electron microscopy. Potential applications of minimally designed peptides with photoswitchable amyloidogenic propensity are briefly discussed.

22727275|t|Transient enriched housing before amyloidosis onset sustains cognitive improvement in Tg2576 mice.
22727275|a|Levels of educational and occupational attainment, as components of cognitive reserve, may modify the relationship between the pathological hallmarks and cognition in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We examined whether exposure of a Tg2576 transgenic mouse model of AD to environmental enrichment (EE) at a specific period during the amyloidogenic process favored the establishment of a cognitive reserve. We found that exposure to EE during early adulthood of Tg2576 mice--before amyloidogenesis has started--reduced the severity of AD-related cognitive deficits more efficiently than exposure later in life, when the pathology is already present. Interestingly, early-life exposure to EE, while slightly reducing forebrain surface covered by amyloid plaques, did not significantly impact aberrant inhibitory remodeling in the hippocampus of Tg2576 mice. Thus, transient early-life exposure to EE exerts long-lasting protection against cognitive impairment during AD pathology. In addition, these data define the existence of a specific life time frame during which stimulatory activity most efficiently builds a cognitive reserve, limiting AD progression and favoring successful aging.

22727791|t|Critical role of intraneuronal Abeta in Alzheimer's disease: technical challenges in studying intracellular Abeta.
22727791|a|AIMS: Multiple lines of evidence have implicated beta-amyloid (Abeta) in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanism(s) whereby Abeta is involved in the disease process remains unclear. The dominant hypothesis in AD has been that Abeta initiates the disease via toxicity from secreted, extracellular Abeta aggregates. More recently, an alternative hypothesis has emerged focusing on a pool of Abeta that accumulates early on within AD vulnerable neurons of the brain. Although the topic of intraneuronal Abeta has been of major interest in the field, technical difficulties in detecting intraneuronal Abeta have also made this topic remarkably controversial. Here we review evidence pointing to the critical role of intraneuronal Abeta in AD and provide insights both into challenges faced in detecting intracellular Abeta and the prion-like properties of Abeta. MAIN METHODS: Immunoprecipitation and Western blot are used for Abeta detection. KEY FINDINGS: We highlight that a standard biochemical method can underestimate intraneuronal Abeta and that extracellular Abeta can up-regulate intracellular Abeta. We also show that detergent can remove intraneuronal Abeta. SIGNIFICANCE: There is a growing awareness that intraneuronal Abeta is a key pathogenic pool of Abeta involved in causing synapse dysfunction. Difficulties in detecting intraneuronal Abeta are an insufficient reason for ignoring this critical pool of Abeta.

22727994|t|Good gene, bad gene: new APP variant may be both.
22727994|a|APP mutations cause Alzheimer disease (AD) with virtually complete penetrance. We found a novel APP mutation (A673V) in the homozygous state in a patient with early-onset AD-type dementia and in his younger sister showing initial signs of cognitive decline. It is noteworthy that the heterozygous relatives were not affected, suggesting that this mutation is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Studies on molecular events for the recessive mutation in causing disease revealed a double synergistic effect: the A673V APP variant shifts APP processing towards the amyloidogenic pathway with increased production of Abeta peptides and it markedly enhances the aggregation and fibrillogenic properties of both Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42. However, co-incubation of mutated and wild-type (wt) Abeta species resulted in inhibition of amyloidogenesis, consistent with the observation that heterozygous carriers do not develop the disease. The opposite effects of the A673V mutation in the homozygous and heterozygous state on amyloidogenesis account for the autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, revealing a new scenario in AD genetics and pathogenesis. The anti-amyloidogenic properties of this novel human Abeta variant may offer grounds for the development of therapeutic strategies for AD based on modified Abeta peptides. Indeed, the interaction between mutated Abeta1-6 and wt full-length Abeta prevents amyloid fibril formation. The anti-amyloidogenic effect is further amplified by the use of a mutated six-mer peptide, constructed entirely from D-amino acids to increase the its stability in vivo. Here we reviewed the studies on pathogenic mechanisms associated with the A673V mutation and the first experimental steps toward the development of a novel disease-modifying therapy for AD.

22728099|t|Epigenetic regulation of BACE1 in Alzheimer's disease patients and in transgenic mice.
22728099|a|In Alzheimer's disease (AD) the complex interplay between environment and genetics has hampered the identification of effective therapeutics. However, epigenetic mechanisms could underlie this complexity. Here, we explored the potential role of epigenetic alterations in AD by investigating gene expression levels and chromatin remodeling in selected AD-related genes. Analysis was performed in the brain of the triple transgenic animal model of AD (3xTg-AD) and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients diagnosed with AD or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). BACE1 mRNA levels were increased in aged 3xTg-AD mice as well as in AD PBMCs along with an increase in promoter accessibility and histone H3 acetylation, while the BACE1 promoter region was less accessible in PBMCs from MCI individuals. Ncstn was downregulated in aged 3xTg-AD brains with a condensation of chromatin and Sirt1 mRNA levels were decreased in these animals despite alterations in histone H3 acetylation. Neither gene was altered in AD PBMCs. The ADORA2A gene was not altered in patients or in the 3xTg-AD mice. Overall, our results suggest that chromatin remodeling plays a role in mRNA alterations in AD, prompting for broader and more detailed studies of chromatin and other epigenetic alterations and their potential use as biomarkers in AD.

22731394|t|3,6'-Dithiothalidomide, a new TNF-alpha synthesis inhibitor, attenuates the effect of Abeta1-42 intracerebroventricular injection on hippocampal neurogenesis and memory deficit.
22731394|a|Evidence indicates altered neurogenesis in neurodegenerative diseases associated with inflammation, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neuroinflammation and its propagation have a critical role in the degeneration of hippocampal neurons, cognitive impairment, and altered neurogenesis. Particularly, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha plays a central role in initiating and regulating the cytokine cascade during an inflammatory response and is up-regulated in brain of AD patients. In this study, we investigated the effects of a novel thalidomide-based TNF-alpha lowering drug, 3,6'-dithiothalidomide, on hippocampal progenitor cell proliferation, neurogenesis and, memory tasks after intracerebroventricular injection of beta-amyloid (Ass)(1-42) peptide. Seven days after Abeta(1-42) injection, a significant proliferation of hippocampal progenitor cells and memory impairment were evident. Four weeks after Abeta(1-42) peptide injection, elevated numbers of surviving 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine cells and newly formed neurons were detected. Treatment with 3,6'-dithiothalidomide attenuated these Abeta(1-42) provoked effects. Our data indicate that although treatment with 3,6'-dithiothalidomide in part attenuated the increase in hippocampal neurogenesis caused by Abeta(1-42) -induced neuroinflammation, the drug prevented memory deficits associated with increased numbers of activated microglial cells and inflammatory response. Therefore, 3,6'-dithiothalidomide treatment likely reduced neuronal tissue damage induced by neuroinflammation following Abeta(1-42) injection. Understanding the modulation of neurogenesis, and its relationship with memory function could open new therapeutic interventions for AD and other neurodegenerative disorders with an inflammatory component.

22731744|t|The butter flavorant, diacetyl, exacerbates beta-amyloid cytotoxicity.
22731744|a|Diacetyl (DA), an ubiquitous butter-flavoring agent, was found to influence several aspects of amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregation--one of the two primary pathologies associated with Alzheimer's disease. Thioflavin T fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopic measurements revealed that DA accelerates Abeta1-42 aggregation into soluble and ultimately insoluble beta-pleated sheet structures. DA was found to covalently bind to Arg5 of Abeta1-42 through proteolytic digestion-mass spectrometric experiments. These biophysical and chemical effects translated into the potentiation of Abeta1-42 cytotoxicity by DA toward SH-SY5Y cells in culture. DA easily traversed through a MDR1-MDCK cell monolayer, an in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier. Additionally, DA was found not only to be resistant to but also inhibitory toward glyoxalase I, the primary initiator of detoxification of amyloid-promoting reactive dicarbonyl species that are generated naturally in large amounts by neuronal tissue. In light of the chronic exposure of industry workers to DA, this study raises the troubling possibility of long-term neurological toxicity mediated by DA.

22738722|t|N-truncated Abeta peptides in complex fluids unraveled by new specific immunoassays.
22738722|a|Previous studies have highlighted the potential physiopathological and diagnostic role of N- and C-terminally truncated amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides in Alzheimer's disease. However, our knowledge about their production remains incomplete, in part due to the lack of very specific and sensitive tools for their detection. We thus developed specific monoclonal antibodies that target either Abeta11-x or Abeta17-x species, which result from the combined cleavages by beta/gamma- or alpha/gamma-secretases, respectively. The presence of Abeta peptides truncated at residue 11 and 17 peptides was qualitatively and quantitatively assessed, using surface enhanced laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and xMAP (Multi-Analyte Profiling) immunoassays, in the supernatant of HEK293 cells that overexpress wild type or mutant Abeta protein precursor or in which alpha- and beta-secretase activities had been modulated. Our results show a differential secretion of Abeta11-40 and Abeta17-40 species by these HEK293 cell lines. Finally, Abeta11-40 concentration in human cerebrospinal fluid (measured with the new xMAP immunoassays) from a first pilot study was higher in cerebrospinal fluid samples from patients with Alzheimer's disease than in samples from patients with other types of dementia.

22738723|t|Behavioral and neurobiological effects of prenatal stress exposure in male and female APPswe/PS1dE9 mice.
22738723|a|Epidemiological evidence implies a role for chronic stress and stress-related disorders in the etiopathogenesis of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although chronic stress exposure during various stages of life has been shown to exacerbate AD-related cognitive deficits and neuropathology in AD mouse models, the role of stress exposure during the prenatal period on AD development and progression remained to be investigated. The present study therefore explored the effects of prenatal maternal stress (PMS) in both male and female APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse offspring in terms of cognition, affect, and AD-related neuropathology. As prenatal perturbations are likely to mediate their effects via alterations in epigenetic regulation, changes in hippocampal DNA methyltransferase 3a, 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels were assessed as underlying mechanisms. Repetitive restraint stress during the first week of gestation exerted a sex-dependent effect, with male PMS mice showing spatial memory deficits and a blunted hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis response, while female PMS mice showed improved spatial memory performance, increased depressive-like behavior, as well as a decrease in hippocampal plaque load. In addition, sex differences were observed among APPswe/PS1dE9 mice, independent of PMS (i.e., female mice showed impaired spatial memory performance, higher hippocampal plaque load, altered amyloid precursor protein processing in the CA3 and lower DNA methyltransferase 3a immunoreactivity in the dentate gyrus when compared with male mice of the same age). In conclusion, PMS exposure impacts on the behavioral phenotype and neuropathology of APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. Moreover, given the remarkable sex differences observed, one should not overlook the impact of sex-specific responses to environmental exposures when investigating gene-environment interactions in AD.

22739235|t|Neuregulin-1 exerts protective effects against neurotoxicities induced by C-terminal fragments of APP via ErbB4 receptor.
22739235|a|Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) plays important roles in the development and plasticity of the brain, and it is also reported to have potent neuroprotective properties. We previously reported that NRG1 has neuroprotective actions against Swedish amyloid precursor protein-induced neurotoxicity. In addition to the amyloid beta peptide, other metabolites of amyloid precursor protein (APP) such as the C-terminal fragments of APP (APP-CTs) have been reported to possess cytotoxic effects in neuronal cells. In this study, we investigated whether NRG1 exerts neuroprotective effects against APP-CTs and attempted to determine its neuroprotective mechanisms. NRG1 attenuated the neurotoxicities induced by the expression of APP-CTs in neuronal cells. NRG1 also reduced the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and attenuated mitochondrial membrane potential loss induced by APP-CTs. In addition, NRG1 upregulated the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. This effect was blocked by the inhibition of ErbB4, a key NRG1 receptor. Taken together, these results demonstrate the neuroprotective potential of NRG1 in Alzheimer's disease.

22739358|t|The neurotoxicity of beta-amyloid peptide toward rat brain is associated with enhanced oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis, all of which can be attenuated by scutellarin.
22739358|a|This study was designed to investigate the processes underlying the neurotoxicity induced by beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) in the rat brain, as well as to examine whether scutellarin (Scu) can prevent this neurotoxicity. Thirty Wistar rats were randomly divided into 3 groups, i.e., untreated (control), treated with Abeta and treated with both Abeta and Scu. The treated rats were subjected to bilateral intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta(25-35) with or without subsequent dietary exposure to Scu. Learning and memory were assessed with the Morris water maze test; the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) were assayed biochemically; expression of the interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) proteins was determined by immunohistochemistry; and neuronal apoptosis was detected with Annexin staining followed by flow cytometry. The animals treated with Abeta exhibited impaired learning and memory; reduced SOD and elevated MAO activity, elevated protein levels of IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha; and a higher percentage of apoptotic neurons in the brain. Interestingly, all of these effects were ameliorated by administration of Scu. These findings indicate that the deficits in learning and memory demonstrated by the rats receiving Abeta are due to elevated oxidative stress and inflammation, which result in apoptosis and that Scu may prevent these deleterious effects.

22742657|t|The neuroprotective effects of milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 against oligomeric amyloid beta toxicity.
22742657|a|BACKGROUND: Phosphatidylserine receptor is a key molecule that mediates the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. Milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 (MFG-E8) is a phosphatidylserine receptor that is expressed on various macrophage lineage cells, including microglia in the central nervous system (CNS). Targeted clearance of degenerated neurons by microglia is essential to maintain healthy neural networks. We previously showed that the CX3C chemokine fractalkine is secreted from degenerated neurons and accelerates microglial clearance of neuronal debris via inducing the release of MFG-E8. However, the mechanisms by which microglia produce MFG-E8 and the precise functions of MFG-E8 are unknown. METHODS: The release of MFG-E8 from microglia treated with conditioned medium from neurons exposed to neurotoxic substances, glutamate or oligomeric amyloid beta (oA beta) was measured by ELISA. The neuroprotective effects of MFG-E8 and MFG-E8-induced microglial phagocytosis of oA beta were assessed by immunocytochemistry. The effects of MFG-E8 on the production of the anti-oxidative enzyme hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) were determined by ELISA and immunocytochemisty. RESULTS: MFG-E8 was induced in microglia treated with conditioned medium from neurons that had been exposed to neurotoxicants, glutamate or oA beta. MFG-E8 significantly attenuated oA beta-induced neuronal cell death in a primary neuron-microglia coculture system. Microglial phagocytosis of oA beta was accelerated by MFG-E8 treatment due to increased CD47 expression in the absence of neurotoxic molecule production, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, nitric oxide, and glutamate. MFG-E8-treated microglia induced nuclear factor E(2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-mediated HO-1 production, which also contributed to neuroprotection. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that microglia release MFG-E8 in response to signals from degenerated neurons and that MFG-E8 protects oA beta-induced neuronal cell death by promoting microglial phagocytic activity and activating the Nrf2-HO-1 pathway. Thus, MFG-E8 may have novel roles as a neuroprotectant in neurodegenerative conditions.

22743389|t|Epidemiology and clinical aspects of stray bullet shootings in the United States.
22743389|a|BACKGROUND: Stray bullet shootings contribute to a sense of risk in affected communities but have rarely been studied. We describe the epidemiology and clinical aspects of stray bullet shootings in the United States. METHODS: We defined a case as a shooting event involving death or injury to a person and meeting criteria for a stray bullet mechanism of injury. From March 1, 2008, to February 28, 2009, we conducted real-time surveillance using two automated Internet news searches for the term "stray bullet." Secondary searches were performed to identify new cases and additional news reports. RESULTS: We reviewed 1,996 non duplicate news reports for 501 shooting events, of which 284 (56.7%) met our case criteria. There were 317 persons injured by stray bullets, of whom 65 (20.5%) died. Most cases (59.2%) involved interpersonal violence. When compared with persons killed or injured in firearm-related assaults or unintentional shootings generally in the United States in 2007, those killed or injured by stray bullets were more likely to be female (44.8% and 10.7%, respectively; odds ratio, 7.4; 95% confidence interval, 5.9-9.3) and outside the age range 15 years to 34 years (55.5% and 27.0%, respectively; odds ratio, 5.6; 95% confidence interval, 4.3-7.3). Most stray bullet victims (81.4%) were apparently unaware of the events leading to the gunfire that caused their injuries. Shooters were predominantly male (95.9%); 62.0% were aged 15 years to 34 years. Eighteen deaths (27.7%) occurred at the scene of the shooting and 55 (84.6%) on the day of the shooting. The case-fatality ratio for stray bullet shootings was somewhat higher than that for firearm-related assaults or unintentional shootings in the United States in 2007. CONCLUSION: Stray bullet shootings are epidemiologically distinct from other firearm-related injury events. It is likely that not all stray bullet shootings were identified, there may have been differential reporting related to severity of outcome, and missing data were common. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Epidemiological study, level III.

22745479|t|Spreading of neurodegenerative pathology via neuron-to-neuron transmission of beta-amyloid.
22745479|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the major cause of dementia. During the development of AD, neurofibrillary tangles progress in a fixed pattern, starting in the transentorhinal cortex followed by the hippocampus and cortical areas. In contrast, the deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques, which are the other histological hallmark of AD, does not follow the same strict spatiotemporal pattern, and it correlates poorly with cognitive decline. Instead, soluble Abeta oligomers have received increasing attention as probable inducers of pathogenesis. In this study, we use microinjections into electrophysiologically defined primary hippocampal rat neurons to demonstrate the direct neuron-to-neuron transfer of soluble oligomeric Abeta. Additional studies conducted in a human donor-acceptor cell model show that this Abeta transfer depends on direct cellular connections. As the transferred oligomers accumulate, acceptor cells gradually show beading of tubulin, a sign of neurite damage, and gradual endosomal leakage, a sign of cytotoxicity. These observations support that intracellular Abeta oligomers play a role in neurodegeneration, and they explain the manner in which Abeta can drive disease progression, even if the extracellular plaque load is poorly correlated with the degree of cognitive decline. Understanding this phenomenon sheds light on the pathophysiological mechanism of AD progression. Additional elucidation will help uncover the detailed mechanisms responsible for the manner in which AD progresses via anatomical connections and will facilitate the development of new strategies for stopping the progression of this incapacitating disease.

22745485|t|Abeta1-42-RAGE interaction disrupts tight junctions of the blood-brain barrier via Ca2+-calcineurin signaling.
22745485|a|The blood-brain barrier (BBB), which is formed by adherens and tight junctions (TJs) of endothelial cells, maintains homeostasis of the brain. Disrupted intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and breakdown of the BBB have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is known to interact with amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) and mediate Abeta transport across the BBB, contributing to the deposition of Abeta in the brain. However, molecular mechanisms underlying Abeta-RAGE interaction-induced alterations in the BBB have not been identified. We found that Abeta1-42 induces enhanced permeability, disruption of zonula occludin-1 (ZO-1) expression in the plasma membrane, and increased intracellular calcium and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) secretion in cultured endothelial cells. Neutralizing antibodies against RAGE and inhibitors of calcineurin and MMPs prevented Abeta1-42-induced changes in ZO-1, suggesting that Abeta-RAGE interactions alter TJ proteins through the Ca2+-calcineurin pathway. Consistent with these in vitro findings, we found disrupted microvessels near Abeta plaque-deposited areas, elevated RAGE expression, and enhanced MMP secretion in microvessels of the brains of 5XFAD mice, an animal model for AD. We have identified a potential molecular pathway underlying Abeta-RAGE interaction-induced breakage of BBB integrity. This pathway might play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD.

22746342|t|Mitochondrial ferritin attenuates beta-amyloid-induced neurotoxicity: reduction in oxidative damage through the Erk/P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways.
22746342|a|AIMS: Mitochondrial ferritin (MtFt), which was recently discovered, plays an important role in preventing neuronal damage in 6-hydroxydopamine-induced Parkinsonism by maintaining mitochondrial iron homeostasis. Disruption of iron regulation also plays a key role in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To explore the potential neuroprotective roles of MtFt, rats and cells were treated with Abeta(25-35) to establish an AD model. RESULTS: We report that knockdown of MtFt expression significantly enhanced Abeta(25-35)-induced neurotoxicity as shown by dysregulation of iron homeostasis, enhanced oxidative stress, and increased cell apoptosis. Opposite results were obtained when MtFt was overexpressed in SH-SY5Y cells prior to treatment with Abeta(25-35). Further, MtFt inhibited Abeta(25-35)-induced P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) signaling. INNOVATION: MtFt attenuated Abeta(25-35)-induced neurotoxicity and reduced oxidative damage through Erk/P38 kinase signaling. CONCLUSION: Our results show a protective role of MtFt in AD and suggest that regulation of MtFt expression in neuronal cells may provide a new neuroprotective strategy for AD.

22747493|t|Therapeutic redistribution of metal ions to treat Alzheimer's disease.
22747493|a|Currently, therapeutics that modify Alzheimer's disease (AD)are not available. Increasing age is the primary risk factor for AD and due to an aging global population the urgent need for effective therapeutics increases every year. This Account presents the development of an AD treatment strategy that incorporates diverse compounds with a common characteristic: the ability to redistribute metal ions within the brain. Central to cognitive decline in AD is the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) that accumulates in the AD brain. A range of therapeutic strategies have been developed based on the premise that decreasing the brain Abeta burden will attenuate the severity of the disease symptoms. Unfortunately these treatments have failed to show any positive outcomes in large-scale clinical trials, raising many questions regarding whether therapeutics for AD can rely solely on decreasing Abeta levels. An alternate strategy is to target the interaction between Abeta and metal ions using compounds with the potential to redistribute metal ions within the brain. The original rationale for this strategy came from studies showing that metal ions promote Abeta toxicity and aggregation. In initial studies using the prototype metal-chelating compound clioquinol (CQ), CQ prevented Abeta toxicity in vitro, out-competed Abeta for metal ions without affecting the activity of metal-dependent enzymes, and attenuated the rate of cognitive decline in AD subjects in a small phase II clinical trial. All these outcomes were consistent with the original hypothesized mechanism of action for CQ where prevention or reversal of the extracellular Abeta-metal interactions could prevent Abeta toxicity. Soon after the completion of these studies, a new body of work began to suggest that this hypothesized mechanism of action for CQ was simplistic and that other factors were also important for the positive therapeutic outcomes. Perhaps most significantly, it was shown that after CQ sequesters metal ions the neutral CQ-metal complex crosses cell membranes to increase intracellular levels of the metals, thereby initiating protective cell signaling cascades. The activity of CQ therefore appeared to be two-fold: it prevented toxic interactions between Abeta and metal ions outside the cell, and it redistributed the metal ions into the cell to promote healthy cell function. To determine the significance of redistributing metal ions into the cell, glyoxalbis(N(4)-methylthiosemicarbazonato)Cu(II) [Cu(II)(gtsm)] was tested in models of AD. Cu(II)(gtsm) delivers Cu into cells, but, unlike CQ, it cannot out-compete Abeta for metal ions. When tested in AD model mice, the Cu(II)(gtsm) treatment restored cognitive function back to levels expected for cognitively healthy mice. The most advanced compound from this therapeutic strategy, PBT2, can sequester metal ions from Abeta and redistribute them into the cell like CQ. PBT2 improved cognition in a phase II clinical trial with AD patients, and further clinical testing is currently underway.

22747709|t|Lipopolysaccharide impairs amyloid beta efflux from brain: altered vascular sequestration, cerebrospinal fluid reabsorption, peripheral clearance and transporter function at the blood-brain barrier.
22747709|a|BACKGROUND: Defects in the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1) and p-glycoprotein (Pgp) clearance of amyloid beta (Abeta) from brain are thought to contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have recently shown that induction of systemic inflammation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) results in impaired efflux of Abeta from the brain. The same treatment also impairs Pgp function. Here, our aim is to determine which physiological routes of Abeta clearance are affected following systemic inflammation, including those relying on LRP-1 and Pgp function at the blood-brain barrier. METHODS: CD-1 mice aged between 6 and 8 weeks were treated with 3 intraperitoneal injections of 3 mg/kg LPS at 0, 6, and 24 hours and studied at 28 hours. 125I-Abeta1-42 or 125I-alpha-2-macroglobulin injected into the lateral ventricle of the brain (intracerebroventricular (ICV)) or into the jugular vein (intravenous (IV)) was used to quantify LRP-1-dependent partitioning between the brain vasculature and parenchyma and peripheral clearance, respectively. Disappearance of ICV-injected 14 C-inulin from brain was measured to quantify bulk flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Brain microvascular protein expression of LRP-1 and Pgp was measured by immunoblotting. Endothelial cell localization of LRP-1 was measured by immunofluorescence microscopy. Oxidative modifications to LRP-1 at the brain microvasculature were measured by immunoprecipitation of LRP-1 followed by immunoblotting for 4-hydroxynonenal and 3-nitrotyrosine. RESULTS: We found that LPS: caused an LRP-1-dependent redistribution of ICV-injected Abeta from brain parenchyma to brain vasculature and decreased entry into blood; impaired peripheral clearance of IV-injected Abeta; inhibited reabsorption of CSF; did not significantly alter brain microvascular protein levels of LRP-1 or Pgp, or oxidative modifications to LRP-1; and downregulated LRP-1 protein levels and caused LRP-1 mislocalization in cultured brain endothelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that LRP-1 undergoes complex functional regulation following systemic inflammation which may depend on cell type, subcellular location, and post-translational modifications. Our findings that systemic inflammation causes deficits in both Abeta transport and bulk flow like those observed in AD indicate that inflammation could induce and promote the disease.

22748939|t|Worldwide Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative.
22748939|a|The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) was launched in 2003 to speed drug development by validating imaging and blood/cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease clinical treatment trials. ADNI is a naturalistic (nontreatment) multisite longitudinal study. A true public-private partnership, the first phase of ADNI (ADNI 1) set a new standard for data sharing without embargo. In addition, it has been extended to 2017 by additional funding (North American-ADNI Grand Opportunities and ADNI 2) as well as multiple projects around the world, collectively known as Worldwide ADNI (WW-ADNI). The goal of WW-ADNI is to harmonize projects and results across different geographical sites and to encourage and harmonize data management and availability to investigators around the world. WW-ADNI projects are currently underway in North America, Europe, Japan, Australia, Korea, Taiwan, and Argentina, with a nascent program in China and a possible future program in Brazil.

22749065|t|Cerebral PET with florbetapir compared with neuropathology at autopsy for detection of neuritic amyloid-beta plaques: a prospective cohort study.
22749065|a|BACKGROUND: Results of previous studies have shown associations between PET imaging of amyloid plaques and amyloid-beta pathology measured at autopsy. However, these studies were small and not designed to prospectively measure sensitivity or specificity of amyloid PET imaging against a reference standard. We therefore prospectively compared the sensitivity and specificity of amyloid PET imaging with neuropathology at autopsy. METHODS: This study was an extension of our previous imaging-to-autopsy study of participants recruited at 22 centres in the USA who had a life expectancy of less than 6 months at enrolment. Participants had autopsy within 2 years of PET imaging with florbetapir ((18)F). For one of the primary analyses, the interpretation of the florbetapir scans (majority interpretation of five nuclear medicine physicians, who classified each scan as amyloid positive or amyloid negative) was compared with amyloid pathology (assessed according to the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease standards, and classed as amyloid positive for moderate or frequent plaques or amyloid negative for no or sparse plaques); correlation of the image analysis results with amyloid burden was tested as a coprimary endpoint. Correlation, sensitivity, and specificity analyses were also done in the subset of participants who had autopsy within 1 year of imaging as secondary endpoints. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT 01447719 (original study NCT 00857415). FINDINGS: We included 59 participants (aged 47-103 years; cognitive status ranging from normal to advanced dementia). The sensitivity and specificity of florbetapir PET imaging for detection of moderate to frequent plaques were 92% (36 of 39; 95% CI 78-98) and 100% (20 of 20; 80-100%), respectively, in people who had autopsy within 2 years of PET imaging, and 96% (27 of 28; 80-100%) and 100% (18 of 18; 78-100%), respectively, for those who had autopsy within 1 year. Amyloid assessed semiquantitatively with florbetapir PET was correlated with the post-mortem amyloid burden in the participants who had an autopsy within 2 years (Spearman rho=0 76; p<0 0001) and within 12 months between imaging and autopsy (0 79; p<0 0001). INTERPRETATION: The results of this study validate the binary visual reading method approved in the USA for clinical use with florbetapir and suggest that florbetapir could be used to distinguish individuals with no or sparse amyloid plaques from those with moderate to frequent plaques. Additional research is needed to understand the prognostic implications of moderate to frequent plaque density. FUNDING: Avid Radiopharmaceuticals.

22750275|t|Effects of prenatal stress exposure on soluble Abeta and brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling in male and female APPswe/PS1dE9 mice.
22750275|a|Chronic stress and stress-related disorders, such as major depression (MD), have been shown to increase the risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been postulated as a neurophysiological link between these illnesses. Our previous research has indicated that exposing the APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse model of AD to prenatal maternal stress (PS) induced a depressive-like phenotype, specifically in female mice. Considering the role of BDNF in depressive-like behavior and its interactions with amyloid-beta (Abeta), our aim was to explore whether these mice would also exhibit alterations in soluble Abeta, mature BDNF (mBDNF), proBDNF, and the receptors TrkB and p75(NTR) in comparison to non-stressed animals. Our results demonstrate that female APPswe/PS1dE9 mice have higher levels of hippocampal proBDNF and soluble Abeta as compared to their male littermates. Additionally, a tendency was observed for PS to lower mBDNF protein levels in the hippocampus, but only in female mice, while receptor levels remained unaltered by sex or PS exposure. Given that female mice both have higher proBDNF and Abeta levels, these findings suggest an underlying role for BDNF signaling and Abeta production in the selective vulnerability of women for MD and AD development.

22750418|t|Aggregation and fibril morphology of the Arctic mutation of Alzheimer's Abeta peptide by CD, TEM, STEM and in situ AFM.
22750418|a|Morphology of aggregation intermediates, polymorphism of amyloid fibrils and aggregation kinetics of the "Arctic" mutant of the Alzheimer's amyloid beta-peptide, Abeta((1-40))(E22G), in a physiologically relevant Tris buffer (pH 7.4) were thoroughly explored in comparison with the human wild type Alzheimer's amyloid peptide, wt-Abeta((1-40)), using both in situ atomic force and electron microscopy, circular dichroism and thioflavin T fluorescence assays. For arc-Abeta((1-40)) at the end of the 'lag'-period of fibrillization an abrupt appearance of   3 nm size 'spherical aggregates' with a homogeneous morphology, was identified. Then, the aggregation proceeds with a rapid growth of amyloid fibrils with a variety of morphologies, while the spherical aggregates eventually disappeared during in situ measurements. Arc-Abeta((1-40)) was also shown to form fibrils at much lower concentrations than wt-Abeta((1-40)): <= 2.5 muM and 12.5 muM, respectively. Moreover, at the same concentration, 50 muM, the aggregation process proceeds more rapidly for arc-Abeta((1-40)): the first amyloid fibrils were observed after c.a. 72 h from the onset of incubation as compared to approximately 7 days for wt-Abeta((1-40)). Amyloid fibrils of arc-Abeta((1-40)) exhibit a large variety of polymorphs, at least five, both coiled and non-coiled distinct fibril structures were recognized by AFM, while at least four types of arc-Abeta((1-40)) fibrils were identified by TEM and STEM and their mass-per-length statistics were collected suggesting supramolecular structures with two, four and six beta-sheet laminae. Our results suggest a pathway of fibrillogenesis for full-length Alzheimer's peptides with small and structurally ordered transient spherical aggregates as on-pathway immediate precursors of amyloid fibrils.

22750528|t|Activation of the gamma-secretase complex and presence of gamma-secretase-activating protein may contribute to Abeta42 production in sporadic inclusion-body myositis muscle fibers.
22750528|a|The muscle-fiber phenotype of sporadic inclusion-body myositis (s-IBM), the most common muscle disease associated with aging, shares several pathological abnormalities with Alzheimer disease (AD) brain, including accumulation of amyloid-beta 42 (Abeta42) and its cytotoxic oligomers. The exact mechanisms leading to Abeta42 production within s-IBM muscle fibers are not known. Abeta42 and Abeta40 are generated after the amyloid-precursor protein (AbetaPP) is cleaved by beta-secretase and the gamma-secretase complex. Abeta42 is considered more cytotoxic than Abeta40, and it has a higher propensity to oligomerize, form amyloid fibrils, and aggregate. Recently, we have demonstrated in cultured human muscle fibers that experimental inhibition of lysosomal enzyme activities leads to Abeta42 oligomerization. In s-IBM muscle, we here demonstrate prominent abnormalities of the gamma-secretase complex, as evidenced by: a) increase of gamma-secretase components, namely active presenilin 1, presenilin enhancer 2, nicastrin, and presence of its mature, glycosylated form; b) increase of mRNAs of these gamma-secretase components; c) increase of gamma-secretase activity; d) presence of an active form of a newly-discovered gamma-secretase activating protein (GSAP); and e) increase of GSAP mRNA. Furthermore, we demonstrate that experimental inhibition of lysosomal autophagic enzymes in cultured human muscle fibers a) activates gamma-secretase, and b) leads to posttranslational modifications of AbetaPP and increase of Abeta42. Since autophagy is impaired in biopsied s-IBM muscle, the same mechanism might be responsible for its having increased gamma-secretase activity and Abeta42 production. Accordingly, improving lysosomal function might be a therapeutic strategy for s-IBM patients.

22751177|t|Convection-enhanced delivery of neprilysin: a novel amyloid-beta-degrading therapeutic strategy.
22751177|a|Enzymatic degradation contributes to the control of intracerebral amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide levels. Previous studies have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of viral vector-mediated neprilysin (NEP) gene therapy in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, clinical translation of NEP gene therapy is limited by ethical and practical considerations. In this study we have assessed the potential of convection-enhanced delivery (CED) as a means of elevating intracerebral NEP level and activity and degrading endogenous Abeta. We analyzed the interstitial and perivascular distribution of NEP following CED into rat striatum. We measured NEP protein level, clearance, activity, and toxicity by ELISA for NEP and synaptophysin, NEP-specific activity assay, and immunohistochemistry for NEP, NeuN, glial fibrillary acidic protein and Iba1. We subsequently performed CED of NEP in normal aged rats and measured endogenous Abeta by ELISA. CED resulted in widespread distribution of NEP, and a 20-fold elevation of NEP protein level with preservation of enzyme activity and without evidence of toxicity. CED in normal, aged rats resulted in a significant reduction in endogenous Abeta(40) (p = 0.04), despite rapid NEP clearance from the brain (half-life ~3 h). CED of NEP has therapeutic potential as a dynamically controllable Abeta(40)-degrading therapeutic strategy for AD. Further studies are required to determine the longer term effects on Abeta (including Abeta(42)) and on cognitive function.

22752387|t|Attenuation of Abeta-induced neurotoxicity by thymoquinone via inhibition of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress.
22752387|a|Beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides are considered to play a major role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and compounds that can prevent pathways of Abeta-induced neurotoxicity may be potential therapeutic agents for treatment of AD. This study examined the hypothesis that thymoquinone (TQ) would reduce oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in differentiated pheochromocytoma (PC 12) cells exposed to Abeta fragment 25-35 (Abeta(25-35)). To test this hypothesis, Abeta was used to induce an in vitro model of AD in differentiated PC 12 cell line of rat. After 24 h of exposure with Abeta(25-35), a significant reduction in cell viability and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was observed. In addition, a significant elevation in the TBARS content and nitric oxide (NO) and activity of acetylcholine esterase (AChE) was observed which was restored significantly by TQ pretreatment. Furthermore, TQ also ameliorated glutathione and its dependent enzymes (glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase) which were depleted by Abeta(25-35) in PC 12 cells. These results were supported by the immunocytochemical finding that has shown protection of cells by TQ from noxious effects of Abeta(25-35). These results indicate that TQ holds potential for neuroprotection and may be a promising approach for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders including AD.

22753410|t|Swedish Alzheimer mutation induces mitochondrial dysfunction mediated by HSP60 mislocalization of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and beta-amyloid.
22753410|a|Alzheimer disease (AD) is a complex disorder that involves numerous cellular and subcellular alterations including impairments in mitochondrial homeostasis. To better understand the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of AD, we analyzed brains from clinically well-characterized human subjects and from the 3xTg-AD mouse model of AD. We find Abeta and critical components of the gamma-secretase complex, presenilin-1, -2, and nicastrin, accumulate in the mitochondria. We used a proteomics approach to identify binding partners and show that heat shock protein 60 (HSP60), a molecular chaperone localized to mitochondria and the plasma membrane, specifically associates with APP. We next generated stable neural cell lines expressing human wild-type or Swedish APP, and provide corroborating in vitro evidence that HSP60 mediates translocation of APP to the mitochondria. Viral-mediated shRNA knockdown of HSP60 attenuates APP and Abeta mislocalization to the mitochondria. Our findings identify a novel interaction between APP and HSP60, which accounts for its translocation to the mitochondria.

22755035|t|Interaction of beta-amyloid interactions with peptide functionalized gold nanoparticles.
22755035|a|The physicochemical properties of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) functionalized with peptides and N-methylated peptides were studied with respect to their interaction with beta-amyloid (1-42). Peptides with sequences of CGGIGLMVG and CGGGGGIGLMVG linked with GNPs of an average diameter of 13 nm were employed for this study. The peptide-GNPs were found to be soluble and dispersed at pH 7.4 in a sodium phosphate aqueous buffer solution. The resonance spectra of each peptide coated GNP was measured in the absence and presence of beta-amyloid (1-42). The difference in the intensity of the lambda(max) of the resonance absorption bands was attributed to the interaction of the functionalized GNPs with the protein. Particles bearing the CGGGGGIGLMVG sequence exhibited the largest change in lambda(max) intensity; the prevention of fibril formation and inhibition of cytotoxicity was also examined.

22759926|t|Cholinergic denervation exacerbates amyloid pathology and induces hippocampal atrophy in Tg2576 mice.
22759926|a|The main pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) consist of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Hippocampal cell loss, atrophy and cholinergic dysfunction are also features of AD. The present work is aimed at studying the interactions between cholinergic denervation, APP processing and hippocampal integrity. The cholinergic immunotoxin mu p-75-saporin was injected into the 3rd ventricle of 6- to 8-month-old Tg2576 mice to induce a cholinergic denervation. Four weeks after cholinergic immunolesion, a significant 14-fold increase of soluble Abeta1-42 was observed. Cholinergically lesioned Tg2576 mice showed hippocampal atrophy together with degenerating FluoroJade-B-stained neurons and reduction of synaptophysin expression in CA1-3 pyramidal layers. We also found that cholinergic denervation led to reduced levels of ADAM17 in hippocampus of Tg2576 mice. Inhibition of ADAM17 with TAPI-2 (5 muM) decreased viability of hippocampal primary neurons from Tg2576 brains and decreased phosphorylation of downstream effectors of trophic signalling (ERK and Akt). The cholinergic agonist carbachol (100 muM) rescued these effects, suggesting that cholinergic deficits might render hippocampus more vulnerable to neurotoxicity upon certain toxic environments. The present work proposes a novel model of AD that worsens the patent amyloid pathology of Tg2576 mice together with hippocampal synaptic pathology and neurodegeneration. Drugs aimed at favoring cholinergic transmission should still be considered as potential treatments of AD.

22762316|t|Cognitive trajectories after postoperative delirium.
22762316|a|BACKGROUND: Delirium is common after cardiac surgery and may be associated with long-term changes in cognitive function. We examined postoperative delirium and the cognitive trajectory during the first year after cardiac surgery. METHODS: We enrolled 225 patients 60 years of age or older who were planning to undergo coronary-artery bypass grafting or valve replacement. Patients were assessed preoperatively, daily during hospitalization beginning on postoperative day 2, and at 1, 6, and 12 months after surgery. Cognitive function was assessed with the use of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; score range, 0 to 30, with lower scores indicating poorer performance). Delirium was diagnosed with the use of the Confusion Assessment Method. We examined performance on the MMSE in the first year after surgery, controlling for demographic characteristics, coexisting conditions, hospital, and surgery type. RESULTS: The 103 participants (46%) in whom delirium developed postoperatively had lower preoperative mean MMSE scores than those in whom delirium did not develop (25.8 vs. 26.9, P<0.001). In adjusted models, those with delirium had a larger drop in cognitive function (as measured by the MMSE score) 2 days after surgery than did those without delirium (7.7 points vs. 2.1, P<0.001) and had significantly lower postoperative cognitive function than those without delirium, both at 1 month (mean MMSE score, 24.1 vs. 27.4; P<0.001) and at 1 year (25.2 vs. 27.2, P<0.001) after surgery. With adjustment for baseline differences, the between-group difference in mean MMSE scores was significant 30 days after surgery (P<0.001) but not at 6 or 12 months (P=0.056 for both). A higher percentage of patients with delirium than those without delirium had not returned to their preoperative baseline level at 6 months (40% vs. 24%, P=0.01), but the difference was not significant at 12 months (31% vs. 20%, P=0.055). CONCLUSIONS: Delirium is associated with a significant decline in cognitive ability during the first year after cardiac surgery, with a trajectory characterized by an initial decline and prolonged impairment.

22762350|t|Morin inhibits the early stages of amyloid beta-peptide aggregation by altering tertiary and quaternary interactions to produce "off-pathway" structures.
22762350|a|Alzheimer's disease is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder whose pathology has been linked to the aggregation and deposition of the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) in neural tissue. A truly effective therapeutic agent remains elusive, and attention has recently turned to the use of natural products as effective antiaggregation compounds, directly targeting Abeta. Although a wealth of in vitro and in vivo evidence suggests these compounds or their derivatives might be beneficial, a detailed understanding of the mechanism by which they act remains largely unknown. Using atomistic, explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulations, we have investigated the association of the flavonoid morin with Abeta monomers and dimers. Through 90 simulations totaling 23.65 mus, we found that treatment of Abeta peptides with morin largely does not affect secondary structure content, unless a large molar excess of morin is present. However, in simulations of Abeta monomers and dimers, morin affected the tertiary and quaternary structure of Abeta, even at low concentrations that have been used experimentally. Thus it appears that despite the inability of morin to fully block Abeta aggregation or beta-strand formation, we observe structures with altered tertiary and quaternary interactions, which may represent "off-pathway" aggregates that have been proposed previously. The simulations presented here add important new details to the mechanism of these processes.

22764362|t|Lower CSF amyloid beta peptides and higher F2-isoprostanes in cognitively intact elderly individuals with major depressive disorder.
22764362|a|OBJECTIVE: Major depressive disorder is common in the elderly, and symptoms are often not responsive to conventional antidepressant treatment, especially in the long term. Soluble oligomeric and aggregated forms of amyloid beta peptides, especially amyloid beta 42, impair neuronal and synaptic function. Amyloid beta 42 is the main component of plaques and is implicated in Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid beta peptides also induce a depressive state in rodents and disrupt major neurotransmitter systems linked to depression. The authors assessed whether major depression was associated with CSF levels of amyloid beta, tau protein, and F2-isoprostanes in elderly individuals with major depressive disorder and age-matched nondepressed comparison subjects. METHOD: CSF was obtained from 47 cognitively intact volunteers (major depression group, N=28; comparison group, N=19) and analyzed for levels of soluble amyloid beta, total and phosphorylated tau proteins, and isoprostanes. RESULTS: Amyloid beta 42 levels were significantly lower in the major depression group relative to the comparison group, and amyloid beta 40 levels were lower but only approaching statistical significance. In contrast, isoprostane levels were higher in the major depression group. No differences were observed in total and phosphorylated tau proteins across conditions. Antidepressant use was not associated with differences in amyloid beta 42 levels. CONCLUSIONS: Reduction in CSF levels of amyloid beta 42 may be related to increased brain amyloid beta plaques or decreased soluble amyloid beta production in elderly individuals with major depression relative to nondepressed comparison subjects. These results may have implications for our understanding of the pathophysiology of major depression and for the development of treatment strategies.

22765389|a|Self-assembly of amyloidogenic peptides and their metal complexes are of multiple interest including their association with several neurological diseases. Therefore, a better understanding of the role of metal ions in the aggregation process is of broad interest. We report pH-dependent structural and aggregation studies on Zn(II) binding to the amyloidogenic peptide Ab11-28. The results suggest that coordination of the N-terminal amine to Zn(II) is responsible for the inhibition of amyloid formation and the overall charge for amorphous aggregates.

22766501|t|Deletion of microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 protects neuronal cells from cytotoxic effects of beta-amyloid peptide fragment 31-35.
22766501|a|Epidemiological studies have suggested that the long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) activity moderates the onset or progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus it has been suggested that prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), a major end-product of COX, may play a pathogenic role in AD, but the involvement of PGE synthase (PGES), a terminal enzyme downstream from COX, has not been fully elucidated. To examine the involvement in AD pathology of microsomal PGES-1 (mPGES-1), a PGES enzyme, we here prepared primary cerebral neuronal cells from the cerebri of wild-type and mPGES-1-deficient mice and then treated them with beta-amyloid (Abeta) fragment 31-35 (Abeta(31-35)), which represents the shortest sequence of native Abeta peptide required for neurotoxicity. Treatment of wild-type neuronal cells with Abeta(31-35) induced mPGES-1 gene expression and PGE(2) production, followed by significant apoptotic cell death, but apoptosis was not induced in mPGES-1-deficient cells. Furthermore, the combined treatment of Abeta(31-35) and PGE(2) induced apoptosis in mPGES-1-deficient neuronal cells. These results indicated that mPGES-1 is induced during Abeta-mediated neuronal cell death and is involved in Abeta-induced neurotoxicity associated with AD pathology.

22766733|t|Lowered serum amyloid-beta1-42 autoantibodies in individuals with lifetime depression.
22766733|a|Reduced levels of naturally occurring autoantibodies against amyloid-beta (Abeta) have been described in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Lifetime depression doubles the risk of AD, thus these autoantibodies may also be reduced in this group. We measured serum IgG autoantibody titers against Abeta1-42, S100b and alpha-synuclein in 214 individuals with depression and 419 controls. Titers against Abeta1-42 were lower in individuals with lifetime depression (5544.6 +- 389.3) compared to controls (7208.7 +- 482.4; p = 0.048). Titers against S100b and alpha-synuclein were comparable between the cohorts. These data suggest an AD-like impairment of the humoral immune response in a relevant proportion of individuals with depression.

22766739|t|Postmortem Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) binding increases with Alzheimer's disease progression.
22766739|a|The development of imaging reagents is of considerable interest in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) field. Some of these, such as Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB), were designed to bind to the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), the major component of amyloid deposits in the AD brain. Although these agents were designed for imaging amyloid deposits in vivo, a major avenue of evaluation relies on postmortem cross validation with established indices of AD pathology. In this study, we evaluated changes in the postmortem binding of PiB and its relationship to other aspects of Abeta-related pathology in a series of AD cases and age-matched controls. We also examined cases of preclinical AD (PCAD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), both considered early points in the AD continuum. PiB binding was found to increase with the progression of the disease and paralleled increases in the less soluble forms of Abeta, including SDS-stable Abeta oligomers. Increased PiB binding and its relationship to Abeta was only significant in a brain region vulnerable to the development of AD pathology (the superior and middle temporal gyri) but not in an unaffected region (cerebellum). This implies that the amyloid deposited in disease-affected regions may possess fundamental, brain region specific characteristics that may not as yet be fully appreciated. These data support the idea that PiB is a useful diagnostic tool for AD, particularly in the early stage of the disease, and also show that PiB could be a useful agent for the discovery of novel disease-related properties of amyloid.

22766770|t|Efficacy of Souvenaid in mild Alzheimer's disease: results from a randomized, controlled trial.
22766770|a|Souvenaid aims to improve synapse formation and function. An earlier study in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) showed that Souvenaid increased memory performance after 12 weeks in drug-naive patients with mild AD. The Souvenir II study was a 24-week, randomized, controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, multi-country trial to confirm and extend previous findings in drug-naive patients with mild AD. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive Souvenaid or an iso-caloric control product once daily for 24 weeks. The primary outcome was the memory function domain Z-score of the Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB) over 24 weeks. Electroencephalography (EEG) measures served as secondary outcomes as marker for synaptic connectivity. Assessments were done at baseline, 12, and 24 weeks. The NTB memory domain Z-score was significantly increased in the active versus the control group over the 24-week intervention period (p = 0.023; Cohen's d = 0.21; 95% confidence interval [-0.06]-[0.49]). A trend for an effect was observed on the NTB total composite z-score (p = 0.053). EEG measures of functional connectivity in the delta band were significantly different between study groups during 24 weeks in favor of the active group. Compliance was very high (96.6% [control] and 97.1% [active]). No difference between study groups in the occurrence of (serious) adverse events. This study demonstrates that Souvenaid is well tolerated and improves memory performance in drug-naive patients with mild AD. EEG outcomes suggest that Souvenaid has an effect on brain functional connectivity, supporting the underlying hypothesis of changed synaptic activity.

22766972|t|Characterization of the role of the antioxidant proteins metallothioneins 1 and 2 in an animal model of Alzheimer's disease.
22766972|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is by far the most commonly diagnosed dementia, and despite multiple efforts, there are still no effective drugs available for its treatment. One strategy that deserves to be pursued is to alter the expression and/or physiological action of endogenous proteins instead of administering exogenous factors. In this study, we intend to characterize the roles of the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and heavy-metal binding proteins, metallothionein-1 + 2 (MT1 + 2), in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, Tg2576 mice. Contrary to expectations, MT1 + 2-deficiency rescued partially the human amyloid precursor protein-induced changes in mortality and body weight in a gender-dependent manner. On the other hand, amyloid plaque burden was decreased in the cortex and hippocampus in both sexes, while the amyloid cascade, neuroinflammation, and behavior were affected in the absence of MT1 + 2 in a complex manner. These results highlight that the control of the endogenous production and/or action of MT1 + 2 could represent a powerful therapeutic target in AD.

22767595|t|Cell surface expression of the major amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta)-degrading enzyme, neprilysin, depends on phosphorylation by mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) and dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1a.
22767595|a|Neprilysin is one of the major amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta)-degrading enzymes, the expression of which declines in the brain during aging. The decrease in neprilysin leads to a metabolic Abeta imbalance, which can induce the amyloidosis underlying Alzheimer disease. Pharmacological activation of neprilysin during aging therefore represents a potential strategy to prevent the development of Alzheimer disease. However, the regulatory mechanisms mediating neprilysin activity in the brain remain unclear. To address this issue, we screened for pharmacological regulators of neprilysin activity and found that the neurotrophic factors brain-derived neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor, and neurotrophins 3 and 4 reduce cell surface neprilysin activity. This decrease was mediated by MEK/ERK signaling, which enhanced phosphorylation at serine 6 in the neprilysin intracellular domain (S6-NEP-ICD). Increased phosphorylation of S6-NEP-ICD in primary neurons reduced the levels of cell surface neprilysin and led to a subsequent increase in extracellular Abeta levels. Furthermore, a specific inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1a, tautomycetin, induced extensive phosphorylation of the S6-NEP-ICD, resulting in reduced cell surface neprilysin activity. In contrast, activation of protein phosphatase-1a increased cell surface neprilysin activity and lowered Abeta levels. Taken together, these results indicate that the phosphorylation status of S6-NEP-ICD influences the localization of neprilysin and affects extracellular Abeta levels. Therefore, maintaining S6-NEP-ICD in a dephosphorylated state, either by inhibition of protein kinases involved in its phosphorylation or by activation of phosphatases catalyzing its dephosphorylation, may represent a new approach to prevent reduction of cell surface neprilysin activity during aging and to maintain physiological levels of Abeta in the brain.

22768945|t|Adsorption mechanism and collapse propensities of the full-length, monomeric Abeta(1-42) on the surface of a single-walled carbon nanotube: a molecular dynamics simulation study.
22768945|a|Though nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes have gained recent attention in biology and medicine, there are few studies at the single-molecule level that explore their interactions with disease-causing proteins. Using atomistic molecular-dynamics simulations, we have investigated the interactions of the monomeric Abeta(1-42) peptide with a single-walled carbon nanotube of small diameter. Starting with peptide-nanotube complexes that delineate the interactions of different segments of the peptide, we find rapid convergence in the peptide's adsorption behavior on the nanotube surface, manifested in its arrested movement, the convergence of peptide-nanotube contact areas and approach distances, and in increased peptide wrapping around the nanotube. In systems where the N-terminal domain is initially distal from nanotube, the adsorption phenomena are initiated by interactions arising from the central hydrophobic core, and precipitated by those arising from the N-terminal residues. Our simulations and free energy calculations together demonstrate that the presence of the nanotube increases the energetic favorability of the open state. We note that the observation of peptide localization could be leveraged for site-specific drug delivery, while the decreased propensity of collapse appears promising for altering kinetics of the peptide's self-assembly.

22771396|t|Dopamine induces apoptosis in APPswe-expressing Neuro2A cells following Pepstatin-sensitive proteolysis of APP in acid compartments.
22771396|a|A pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the presence within neurons and the interneuronal space of aggregates of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides that originate from an abnormal proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). The aspartyl proteases that initiate this processing act in the Golgi and endosomal compartments. Here, we show that the neurotransmitter dopamine stimulates the rapid endocytosis and processing of APP and induces apoptosis in neuroblastoma Neuro2A cells over-expressing transgenic human APP (Swedish mutant). Apoptosis could be prevented by impairing Pepstatin-sensitive and acid-dependent proteolysis of APP within endosomal-lysosomal compartments. The gamma-secretase inhibitor L685,458 and the alpha-secretase stimulator phorbol ester elicited protection from dopamine-induced proteolysis of APP and cell toxicity. Our data shed lights on the mechanistic link between dopamine excitotoxicity, processing of APP and neuronal cell death. Since AD often associates with parkinsonian symptoms, which is suggestive of dopaminergic neurodegeneration, the present data provide the rationale for the therapeutic use of lysosomal activity inhibitors such as chloroquine or Pepstatin A to alleviate the progression of AD leading to onset of parkinsonism.

22771797|t|Erlin-2 is associated with active gamma-secretase in brain and affects amyloid beta-peptide production.
22771797|a|The transmembrane protease complex gamma-secretase is responsible for the generation of the neurotoxic amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) from its precursor (APP). Abeta has a causative role in Alzheimer disease, and thus, gamma-secretase is a therapeutic target. However, since there are more than 70 gamma-secretase substrates besides APP, selective inhibition of APP processing is required. Recent data indicates the existence of several gamma-secretase associated proteins (GSAPs) that affect the selection and processing of substrates. Here, we use a gamma-secretase inhibitor for affinity purification of gamma-secretase and associated proteins from microsomes and detergent resistant membranes (DRMs) prepared from rat or human brain. By tandem mass spectrometry we identified a novel brain GSAP; erlin-2. This protein was recently reported to reside in DRMs in the ER. A proximity ligation assay, as well as co-immunoprecipitation, confirmed the association of erlin-2 with gamma-secretase. We found that a higher proportion of erlin-2 was associated with gamma-secretase in DRMs than in soluble membranes. siRNA experiments indicated that reduced levels of erlin-2 resulted in a decreased Abeta production, whereas the effect on Notch processing was limited. In summary, we have found a novel brain GSAP, erlin-2, that resides in DRMs and affects Abeta production.

22776965|t|Early increases in soluble amyloid-beta levels coincide with cholinergic degeneration in 3xTg-AD mice.
22776965|a|Accumulation of amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) and cholinergic degeneration are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In a triple transgenic mouse model of AD (3xTg-AD), soluble Abeta42 levels were detected in the septum by 2 months of age, reaching their highest levels at 3-6 months and decreasing at 12 months. Deficits in the number of septal cholinergic neurons and the length of hippocampal cholinergic axons were observed starting at 4 months in 3xTg-AD mice. Our results show that septal Abeta and septohippocampal cholinergic pathology in 3xTg-AD mice occur at an early stage of disease.

22776966|t|Focal adhesion kinase activates NF-kappaB via the ERK1/2 and p38MAPK Pathways in amyloid-beta25-35-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells.
22776966|a|Increasing evidence supports that amyloid plaques, comprised of amyloid-beta (Abeta), are a key feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). But the mechanism of Abeta in AD is not yet fully understood. Previous studies have demonstrated that in Abeta-induced apoptosis of nerve cells, differentiated rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells, and microglia, nucleus factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) is activated. Meanwhile, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is also activated. However, the relationship between NF-kappaB and FAK remains unclear. Using differentiated PC12 cells, we investigated this relationship in Abeta(25-35)-induced apoptosis. The results showed that FAK phosphorylation increased at 6-9 hours after Abeta treatment, slightly shorter than the activation of NF-kappaB (6-12 hours). In this process, both extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) phosphorylation levels were increased. After FAK expression was inhibited by its siRNA, the activities of ERK1/2, p38MAPK, and NF-kappaB were all suppressed. When ERK1/2 and p38MAPK expressions were inhibited by their siRNAs respectively, NF-kappaB activity was also suppressed. But FAK phosphorylation was not affected. When NF-kappaB expression was inhibited, all of the phosphorylation levels of FAK, ERK1/2, and p38MAPK were not affected. These phenomena indicated that FAK is upstream of ERK1/2, p38MAPK, and NF-kappaB, and meanwhile both of ERK1/2 and p38MAPK are upstream of NF-kappaB. Co-immunoprecipitation results demonstrated that it is ERK1/2, but not p38MAPK, which directly interacts with IkappaB kinase. Taken together, our results suggest that FAK activates NF-kappaB via ERK1/2 and p38MAPK pathways in Abeta(25-35)-induced apoptosis of differentiated PC12 cells.

22782510|t|Comparison of imaging biomarkers in the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging.
22782510|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine whether magnetic resonance imaging measurements observed in the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) convenience sample differ from those observed in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) population-based sample. DESIGN: Comparison of 2 samples. SETTING: Fifty-nine recruiting sites for the ADNI in the United States and Canada and the MCSA, a population-based cohort in Olmsted County, Minnesota. PATIENTS: Cognitively normal subjects and amnestic subjects with mild cognitive impairment were selected from the ADNI convenience cohort and MCSA population-based cohort. A simple random sample of subjects from both cohorts in the same age range was selected, and a second sample applied matching for age, sex, educational level, apolipoprotein E genotype, and Mini-Mental State Examination score. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Baseline hippocampal volumes and annual percentage of decline in hippocampal volume. RESULTS: In the population-based sample, MCSA subjects were older, had less education, performed worse on the Mini-Mental State Examination, and had a family history of Alzheimer disease less often than did ADNI subjects. Baseline hippocampal volumes were larger in ADNI compared with MCSA cognitively normal subjects in the random sample, although no differences were observed after matching. Rates of decline in hippocampal volume were greater in the ADNI compared with the MCSA for cognitively normal subjects and those with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, even after matching. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of decline in hippocampal volume suggest that ADNI subjects have a more aggressive brain pathologic process than MCSA subjects and hence may not be representative of the general population. These findings have implications for treatment trials that use ADNI-like recruitment mechanisms and for studies validating new diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer disease in its various stages.

22782687|t|Different effects of soluble and aggregated amyloid beta42 on gene/protein expression and enzyme activity involved in insulin and APP pathways.
22782687|a|Although Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is not characterised any longer simply as the accumulation and deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides and hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins within the brain, excessive Abeta(42) deposition is still considered to play a major role in this illness. Abeta are able to adopt many differently aggregate forms, including amyloid fibrils as well as nonfibrillar structures (soluble Abeta(42) oligomers). It is not well-established that which Abeta(42) state is most responsible for AD or why. We wanted to verify which effects Abeta(42) oligomers and aggregated peptides have on gene expression, protein level and enzyme activity of insulin and amyloid precursor protein (APP) pathways in vitro. Human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) were treated with varying concentrations of soluble and aggregated Abeta(42). Treatment effects on beta-secretase (BACE), glycogen synthase kinase 3alpha (GSK3alpha), glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta), phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K), insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), insulin-receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), insulin receptor (INSR) and monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) were investigated via quantitative-PCR, western blot, ELISA and enzyme activity assay. We could find different effects of soluble and aggregated peptides especially on gene/protein expression of GSK3beta and INSR and on GSK3beta and MAO-B activity. Soluble peptides showed significant effects leading to increased gene expression and protein amount of GSK3beta and to decreased level of gene and protein expression of INSR. MAO-B activity was enhanced after treatment with aggregated peptides and strongly inhibited after soluble Abeta(42) treatment. Our data might provide insights into selective effects of specific forms of Abeta(42) aggregates in AD.

22782894|t|Amyloid precursor protein regulates netrin-1-mediated commissural axon outgrowth.
22782894|a|The multifunctional protein netrin-1 was initially discovered as the main attractive cue for commissural axon guidance by acting through its receptor DCC. Recently, we have shown that netrin-1 also interacts with the orphan transmembrane receptor amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP is cleaved by proteases, generating amyloid-beta peptide, the main component of the amyloid plaques that are associated with Alzheimer disease. Our previous work demonstrated that via its interaction with APP, netrin-1 is a negative regulator of amyloid-beta production in adult brain, but the biological relevance of APP/netrin-1 interaction under non-pathological conditions was unknown. We show here that during commissural axon navigation, APP, expressed at the growth cone, is part of the DCC receptor complex mediating netrin-1-dependent axon guidance. APP interacts with DCC in the presence of netrin-1 and enhances netrin-1-mediated DCC intracellular signaling, such as MAPK activation. Inactivation of APP in mice is associated with reduced commissural axon outgrowth. Thus, APP functionally acts as a co-receptor for DCC to mediate axon guidance.

22784036|t|Clinical and biomarker changes in dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease.
22784036|a|BACKGROUND: The order and magnitude of pathologic processes in Alzheimer's disease are not well understood, partly because the disease develops over many years. Autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease has a predictable age at onset and provides an opportunity to determine the sequence and magnitude of pathologic changes that culminate in symptomatic disease. METHODS: In this prospective, longitudinal study, we analyzed data from 128 participants who underwent baseline clinical and cognitive assessments, brain imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood tests. We used the participant's age at baseline assessment and the parent's age at the onset of symptoms of Alzheimer's disease to calculate the estimated years from expected symptom onset (age of the participant minus parent's age at symptom onset). We conducted cross-sectional analyses of baseline data in relation to estimated years from expected symptom onset in order to determine the relative order and magnitude of pathophysiological changes. RESULTS: Concentrations of amyloid-beta (Abeta)(42) in the CSF appeared to decline 25 years before expected symptom onset. Abeta deposition, as measured by positron-emission tomography with the use of Pittsburgh compound B, was detected 15 years before expected symptom onset. Increased concentrations of tau protein in the CSF and an increase in brain atrophy were detected 15 years before expected symptom onset. Cerebral hypometabolism and impaired episodic memory were observed 10 years before expected symptom onset. Global cognitive impairment, as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Clinical Dementia Rating scale, was detected 5 years before expected symptom onset, and patients met diagnostic criteria for dementia at an average of 3 years after expected symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: We found that autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease was associated with a series of pathophysiological changes over decades in CSF biochemical markers of Alzheimer's disease, brain amyloid deposition, and brain metabolism as well as progressive cognitive impairment. Our results require confirmation with the use of longitudinal data and may not apply to patients with sporadic Alzheimer's disease.

22785392|t|Selective impairment of some forms of synaptic plasticity by oligomeric amyloid-beta peptide in the mouse hippocampus: implication of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors.
22785392|a|Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the loss of memory and synaptic damage. Evidence is accumulating for a causal role of soluble oligomeric species of amyloid-beta peptide (Abetao) in the impairment of synaptic plasticity and cognition but the precise mechanisms underlying these effects are still not clear. Synaptic plasticity such as long-term potentiation is thought to underlie learning and memory. While the effect of Abeta on long-term potentiation is well documented, a more general understanding of Abeta action on various aspects of plasticity involving synaptic and extrasynaptic receptors and the nature of the mechanisms involved in its effects are lacking. Using a combination of electrophysiological and biochemical techniques in mouse hippocampal slices, we show here that Abetao drastically affects synaptic plasticities induced by high stimulation frequencies through the involvement of extrasynaptic glutamate receptors. Experiments on hippocampal slices as well as on cultured cortical neurons show that Abetao potentiates extrasynaptic NMDA receptors-mediated responses. Pharmacological characterization indicates that GluN2B-containing NMDARs are involved in these responses. When synaptic and extrasynaptic glutamate receptor-mediated effects are dissociated using cortical neurons in culture, it appears that Abetao has differential effects on these two receptors types. We conclude that the pool of extrasynaptic GluN2B-containing NMDARs is a major target of Abetao in the hippocampus. During high frequency stimulation, Abetao dramatically impairs long-term neuronal responses.

22785397|t|Parkin null cortical neuronal/glial cultures are resistant to amyloid-beta1-42 toxicity: a role for autophagy?
22785397|a|Dementia occurs often in late stages of Parkinson's disease (PD) but its cause is unknown. Likewise there is little information about the interaction between proteins that produce PD and those implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we have investigated the interactions between parkin protein and the amyloid-beta (Abeta)1-42 peptide. We examined the effects of oligomeric Abeta1-42 peptide on the survival, differentiation, and signaling pathways in cortical cultures from wild type (WT) and parkin null (PK-KO) mice. We discovered that PK-KO cells were more resistant than WT to Abeta1-42. This peptide induced neuronal cell death, astrogliosis, microglial proliferation, and increased total and hyperphosphorylated tau and levels of chaperones HSP-70 and CHIP in WT, but not in Abeta-treated PK-KO cultures. Abeta1-42 decreased proteasome activities in WT and PK-KO cultures, but the ubiquitination of proteins only increased in WT cultures. Abeta1-42 induced a short activation of ERK1/2 and AKT signaling pathways, implicated in cell survival, in PK-KO-treated cells, and a shift in the autophagy marker LC3-II/LC3-I ratio. In addition, the percentage of cells immunoreactive to both HSC70 and LAMP-2A increased in PK-KO cultures versus WT and furthermore in PK-KO cultures treated with Abeta1-42. Pre-treatment with inhibitors of glutathione synthesis or autophagy reverted the resistance to Abeta1-42 of the PK-KO cultures. In conclusion, the loss of parkin protein triggers the compensatory mechanisms of cell protection against Abeta1-42. Parkin suppression, therefore, is not a risk factor for dementia of AD type.

22785403|t|Probing and trapping a sensitive conformation: amyloid-beta fibrils, oligomers, and dimers.
22785403|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease with pathological misfolding of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta). The recent interest in Abeta misfolding intermediates necessitates development of novel detection methods and ability to trap these intermediates. We speculated that two regions of Abeta may allow for detection of specific Abeta species: the N-terminal and 22-35, both likely important in oligomer interaction and formation. We determined via epitomics, proteomic assays, and electron microscopy that the Abeta(42) species (wild type, DeltaE22, and MetOx) predominantly formed fibrils, oligomers, or dimers, respectively. The 2H4 antibody to the N-terminal of Abeta, in the presence of 2% SDS, primarily detected fibrils, and an antibody to the 22-35 region detected low molecular weight Abeta species. Simulated molecular modeling provided insight into these SDS-induced structural changes. We next determined if these methods could be used to screen anti-Abeta drugs as well as identify compounds that trap Abeta in various conformations. Immunoblot assays determined that taurine, homotaurine (Tramiprosate), myoinositol, methylene blue, and curcumin did not prevent Abeta aggregation. However, calmidazolium chloride trapped Abeta at oligomers, and berberine reduced oligomer formation. Finally, pretreatment of AD brain tissues with SDS enhanced 2H4 antibody immunostaining of fibrillar Abeta. Thus we identified and characterized Abetas that adopt specific predominant conformations (modified Abeta or via interactions with compounds), developed a novel assay for aggregated Abeta, and applied it to drug screening and immunohistochemistry. In summary, our novel approach facilitates drug screening, increases the probability of success of antibody therapeutics, and improves antibody-based detection and identification of different conformations of Abeta.

22786597|t|Predicting sites of new hemorrhage with amyloid imaging in cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
22786597|a|OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine whether amyloid imaging can help predict the location and number of future hemorrhages in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). METHODS: We performed a longitudinal cohort study of 11 patients with CAA without dementia who underwent serial brain MRIs after baseline amyloid imaging with Pittsburgh compound B (PiB). Mean distribution volume ratio (DVR) of PiB was determined at the sites of new micro/macrobleeds identified on follow-up MRI and compared with PiB retention at "simulated" hemorrhages, randomly placed in the same subjects using a probability distribution map of CAA-hemorrhage location. Mean PiB retention at the sites of observed new bleeds was also compared to that in shells concentrically surrounding the bleeds. Finally the association between number of incident bleeds and 3 regional amyloid measures were obtained. RESULTS: Nine of 11 subjects had at least one new microbleed on follow-up MRI (median 4, interquartile range [IQR] 1-9) and 2 had 5 new intracerebral hemorrhages. Mean DVR was greater at the sites of incident bleeds (1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-1.46) than simulated lesions (1.14, 95% CI 1.07-1.22, p < 0.0001) in multivariable models. PiB retention decreased with increasing distance from sites of observed bleeds (p < 0.0001). Mean DVR in a superior frontal/parasagittal region of interest correlated independently with number of future hemorrhages after adjustment for relevant covariates (p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide direct evidence that new CAA-related hemorrhages occur preferentially at sites of increased amyloid deposition and suggest that PiB-PET imaging may be a useful tool in prediction of incident hemorrhages in patients with CAA.

22786606|t|Amyloid-beta assessed by florbetapir F 18 PET and 18-month cognitive decline: a multicenter study.
22786606|a|OBJECTIVES: Florbetapir F 18 PET can image amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregates in the brains of living subjects. We prospectively evaluated the prognostic utility of detecting Abeta pathology using florbetapir PET in subjects at risk for progressive cognitive decline. METHODS: A total of 151 subjects who previously participated in a multicenter florbetapir PET imaging study were recruited for longitudinal assessment. Subjects included 51 with recently diagnosed mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 69 cognitively normal controls (CN), and 31 with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer disease dementia (AD). PET images were visually scored as positive (Abeta+) or negative (Abeta-) for pathologic levels of beta-amyloid aggregation, blind to diagnostic classification. Cerebral to cerebellar standardized uptake value ratios (SUVr) were determined from the baseline PET images. Subjects were followed for 18 months to evaluate changes in cognition and diagnostic status. Analysis of covariance and correlation analyses were conducted to evaluate the association between baseline PET amyloid status and subsequent cognitive decline. RESULTS: In both MCI and CN, baseline Abeta+ scans were associated with greater clinical worsening on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog (p < 0.01) and Clinical Dementia Rating-sum of boxes (CDR-SB) (p < 0.02). In MCI Abeta+ scans were also associated with greater decline in memory, Digit Symbol Substitution (DSS), and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (p < 0.05). In MCI, higher baseline SUVr similarly correlated with greater subsequent decline on the ADAS-Cog (p < 0.01), CDR-SB (p < 0.03), a memory measure, DSS, and MMSE (p < 0.05). Abeta+ MCI tended to convert to AD dementia at a higher rate than Abeta- subjects (p < 0.10). CONCLUSIONS: Florbetapir PET may help identify individuals at increased risk for progressive cognitive decline.

22787047|t|Intracellular amyloid precursor protein sorting and amyloid-beta secretion are regulated by Src-mediated phosphorylation of Mint2.
22787047|a|Mint adaptor proteins bind to the membrane-bound amyloid precursor protein (APP) and affect the production of pathogenic amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides related to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous studies have shown that loss of each of the three Mint proteins delays the age-dependent production of amyloid plaques in transgenic mouse models of AD. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying Mints effect on amyloid production are unclear. Because Abeta generation involves the internalization of membrane-bound APP via endosomes and Mints bind directly to the endocytic motif of APP, we proposed that Mints are involved in APP intracellular trafficking, which in turn, affects Abeta generation. Here, we show that APP endocytosis was attenuated in Mint knock-out neurons, revealing a role for Mints in APP trafficking. We also show that the endocytic APP sorting processes are regulated by Src-mediated phosphorylation of Mint2 and that internalized APP is differentially sorted between autophagic and recycling trafficking pathways. A Mint2 phosphomimetic mutant favored endocytosis of APP along the autophagic sorting pathway leading to increased intracellular Abeta accumulation. Conversely, the Mint2 phospho-resistant mutant increased APP localization to the recycling pathway and back to the cell surface thereby enhancing Abeta42 secretion. These results demonstrate that Src-mediated phosphorylation of Mint2 regulates the APP endocytic sorting pathway, providing a mechanism for regulating Abeta secretion.

22787053|t|An effector-reduced anti-beta-amyloid (Abeta) antibody with unique abeta binding properties promotes neuroprotection and glial engulfment of Abeta.
22787053|a|Passive immunization against beta-amyloid (Abeta) has become an increasingly desirable strategy as a therapeutic treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, traditional passive immunization approaches carry the risk of Fcgamma receptor-mediated overactivation of microglial cells, which may contribute to an inappropriate proinflammatory response leading to vasogenic edema and cerebral microhemorrhage. Here, we describe the generation of a humanized anti-Abeta monoclonal antibody of an IgG4 isotype, known as MABT5102A (MABT). An IgG4 subclass was selected to reduce the risk of Fcgamma receptor-mediated overactivation of microglia. MABT bound with high affinity to multiple forms of Abeta, protected against Abeta1-42 oligomer-induced cytotoxicity, and increased uptake of neurotoxic Abeta oligomers by microglia. Furthermore, MABT-mediated amyloid plaque removal was demonstrated using in vivo live imaging in hAPP((V717I))/PS1 transgenic mice. When compared with a human IgG1 wild-type subclass, containing the same antigen-binding variable domains and with equal binding to Abeta, MABT showed reduced activation of stress-activated p38MAPK (p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase) in microglia and induced less release of the proinflammatory cytokine TNFalpha. We propose that a humanized IgG4 anti-Abeta antibody that takes advantage of a unique Abeta binding profile, while also possessing reduced effector function, may provide a safer therapeutic alternative for passive immunotherapy for AD. Data from a phase I clinical trial testing MABT is consistent with this hypothesis, showing no signs of vasogenic edema, even in ApoE4 carriers.

22790316|t|Effects of ZSET1446/ST101 on cognitive deficits and amyloid beta deposition in the senescence accelerated prone mouse brain.
22790316|a|The senescence accelerated prone mouse strain 8 (SAMP8) develops age-related deficits in learning and memory. Effects of the azaindolizinone derivative ZSET1446/ST101, a newly synthesized cognitive enhancer, on cognitive impairment and deposition of amyloid &beta; (A&beta;) were assessed in the SAMP8. ZSET1446 was administered in drinking water at estimated doses of 0.002, 0.01, and 0.1 mg/kg per day from the age of 8 months. The SAMP8 at the age of 8 months showed cognitive impairment in a novel object recognition task compared with young SAMP8 at the age of 8 weeks. Further, grading scores were gradually increased from 9 to 12 months and A&beta;-like immunoreactivity in the hippocampus was increased at the age of 10 months. ZSET1446 ameliorated cognitive deficits of SAMP8 after 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks of treatment in a novel object recognition test. ZSET1446 also reduced grading scores of SAMP8 after 16 weeks of treatment. Further, 8-week treatment of ZSET1446 significantly reduced the total number of A&beta;-positive granules in the hippocampus. These results suggest that ZSET1446 shows ameliorating effects on SAMP8 partly due to the suppression of an increase of A&beta;-deposition in the hippocampus.

22791904|t|Posiphen as a candidate drug to lower CSF amyloid precursor protein, amyloid-beta peptide and tau levels: target engagement, tolerability and pharmacokinetics in humans.
22791904|a|AIM: A first in human study to evaluate tolerability and pharmacokinetics followed by an early proof of mechanism (POM) study to determine whether the small orally, available molecule, Posiphen tartrate (Posiphen), lowers secreted (s) amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) alpha and -beta, amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), tau (tau) and inflammatory markers in CSF of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). STUDY DESIGN: Posiphen single and multiple ascending dose phase 1 randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled safety, tolerance, pharmacokinetic studies were undertaken in a total of 120 healthy volunteers to define a dose that was then used in a small non-randomised study of five MCI subjects, used as their own controls, to define target engagement. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pharmacodynamic: sAPPalpha, sAPPbeta, Abeta(42), tau (total (t) and phosphorylated (p)) and inflammatory marker levels were time-dependently measured over 12 h and compared prior to and following 10 days of oral Posiphen treatment in four MCI subjects who completed the study. Pharmacokinetic: plasma and CSF drug and primary metabolite concentrations with estimated brain levels extrapolated from steady-state drug administration in rats. RESULTS: Posiphen proved well tolerated and significantly lowered CSF levels of sAPPalpha, sAPPbeta, t-tau, p-tau and specific inflammatory markers, and demonstrated a trend to lower CSF Abeta(42). CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm preclinical POM studies, demonstrate that pharmacologically relevant drug/metabolite levels reach brain and support the continued clinical optimisation and evaluation of Posiphen for MCI and Alzheimer's disease.

22796601|t|Cognitive and non-cognitive behaviors in the triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease expressing mutated APP, PS1, and Mapt (3xTg-AD).
22796601|a|3xTg-AD mutant mice are characterized by parenchymal Abeta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles resembling those found in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The mutants were compared with non-transgenic controls in sensorimotor and learning tests. 3xTg-AD mutants were deficient in T-maze reversal, object recognition, and passive avoidance learning. In addition, the mutants showed hypoactivity in two open-field tests, fewer fecal boli in an observation jar, and reduced enclosed arm entries and head-dipping in the elevated plus-maze. On the contrary, the mutants did not differ from controls in pain thresholds, nest-building, and various reflexes determined by the SHIRPA primary screen and were even better on the rotorod test of motor coordination.

22796603|t|Evaluation of an Abeta(1-40)-induced cognitive deficit in rat using a reward-directed instrumental learning task.
22796603|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. It is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to gradual loss of cognitive and functional abilities, and development of behavioral disturbances. Previous studies using Abeta(1-40) microinjection in animal models focused on cognitive deficits in spatial learning and avoidance conditioning. However, no attempt has been made to determine the sensitivity of an Abeta(1-40)-manipulated animal model in tasks involving reward-directed instrumental learning (RDIL). Thus, the present study was designed to investigate the effects of intra hippocampal microinjection of Abeta(1-40) on the acquisition and maintenance of a basic instrumental response (lever-pressing), then on the goal directed (higher response ratio) and habit (visual signal discrimination and extinction) learning, as well as on neurotransmitter changes which could potentially alter the regulatory processes involved in instrumental learning. Our present findings demonstrated that the focal hippocampal microinjection of Abeta(1-40) rendered rats unable to process new cue/contextual information in the formation of causal relation, rather than affecting the operant action itself. Although the injected Abeta(1-40) did not directly influence performance, it did prevent the information from being translated into action. Moreover, the neurotransmitter results indicated that multiple neural signaling might be involved in the regulation of RDIL in the Abeta(1-40) injection model. In conclusion, results suggested that our series of instrumental learning tasks may have potential in dementia research as a novel method for testing cognitive behavior.

22796872|t|Broad-based nutritional supplementation in 3xTg mice corrects mitochondrial function and indicates sex-specificity in response to Alzheimer's disease intervention.
22796872|a|Nutrition has been highlighted as a potential factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk and decline and has been investigated as a therapeutic target. Broad-based combination diet therapies have the potential to simultaneously effect numerous protective and corrective processes, both directly (e.g., neuroprotection) and indirectly (e.g., improved vascular health). Here we administered either normal mouse chow with a broad-based nutritional supplement or mouse chow alone to aged male and female 3xTg mice and wildtype (WT) controls. After approximately 4 months of feeding, mice were given a battery of cognitive tasks and then injected with a radiolabeled glucose analog. Brains were assessed for differences in regional glucose uptake and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase activity, AD pathology, and inflammatory markers. Supplementation induced behavioral changes in the 3xTg, but not WT, mice, and the mode of these changes was influenced by sex. Subsequent analyses indicated that differential response to supplementation by male and female 3xTg mice highlighted brain regional strategies for the preservation of function. Several regions involved have been shown to mediate responses to steroid hormones, indicating a mechanism for sex-based vulnerability. Thus, these findings may have broad implications for the human response to future therapeutics.

22799493|t|Efficient access to highly pure beta-amyloid peptide by optimized solid-phase synthesis.
22799493|a|Feasible and reproducible synthesis of full-length Abeta peptides has been one of the major challenges in Alzheimer's disease research. By using dimethyl sulfoxide as an anti-aggregation solvent and as an agent to promote double-coupling of two phenylalanine that frequently experience residual deletion, we developed a reliable manual Fmoc solid phase peptide synthesis procedure to produce biologically active Abeta in large quantities at relatively high purity. The amyloidogenic activity of the synthesized Abeta was confirmed via thioflavin T assay, transmission electron microscopic analysis and electrophoresis.

22800931|t|Inhibition of amyloid-beta peptide aggregation rescues the autophagic deficits in the TgCRND8 mouse model of Alzheimer disease.
22800931|a|scyllo-Inositol (SI) is an endogenous inositol stereoisomer known to inhibit aggregation and fibril formation of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta). Human clinical trials using SI to treat Alzheimer disease (AD) patients have shown potential benefits. In light of the growing therapeutic potential of SI, the objective of our study was to gain a more thorough understanding of the mechanism of action. In addition to Abeta plaques, a prominent pathological feature of AD is the extensive accumulation of autophagic vacuoles (AVs) suggesting dysfunction in this degradation pathway. Using the TgCRND8 mouse model for AD, we examined SI treatment effects on various components of the autophagic pathway. Autophagy impairment in TgCRND8 mice occurs in the latter stages of the pathway where AV-lysosome fusion and lysosomal degradation take place. SI treatment attenuated this impairment with a decrease in the size and the number of accumulated AVs. We propose that the beneficial effects of SI-Abeta interactions may resolve autophagic deficiencies in the AD brains.

22801374|t|Targeting extracellular domains D4 and D7 of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 reveals allosteric receptor regulatory sites.
22801374|a|Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) activate three receptor tyrosine kinases, VEGFR-1, -2, and -3, which regulate angiogenic and lymphangiogenic signaling. VEGFR-2 is the most prominent receptor in angiogenic signaling by VEGF ligands. The extracellular part of VEGF receptors consists of seven immunoglobulin homology domains (Ig domains). Earlier studies showed that domains 2 and 3 (D23) mediate ligand binding, while structural analysis of dimeric ligand/receptor complexes by electron microscopy and small-angle solution scattering revealed additional homotypic contacts in membrane-proximal Ig domains D4 and D7. Here we show that D4 and D7 are indispensable for receptor signaling. To confirm the essential role of these domains in signaling, we isolated VEGFR-2-inhibitory "designed ankyrin repeat proteins" (DARPins) that interact with D23, D4, or D7. DARPins that interact with D23 inhibited ligand binding, receptor dimerization, and receptor kinase activation, while DARPins specific for D4 or D7 did not prevent ligand binding or receptor dimerization but effectively blocked receptor signaling and functional output. These data show that D4 and D7 allosterically regulate VEGFR-2 activity. We propose that these extracellular-domain-specific DARPins represent a novel generation of receptor-inhibitory drugs for in vivo applications such as targeting of VEGFRs in medical diagnostics and for treating vascular pathologies.

22801430|t|BRICHOS domains efficiently delay fibrillation of amyloid beta-peptide.
22801430|a|Amyloid diseases such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, and prion diseases are associated with a specific form of protein misfolding and aggregation into oligomers and fibrils rich in beta-sheet structure. The BRICHOS domain consisting of ~100 residues is found in membrane proteins associated with degenerative and proliferative disease, including lung fibrosis (surfactant protein C precursor; pro-SP-C) and familial dementia (Bri2). We find that recombinant BRICHOS domains from Bri2 and pro-SP-C prevent fibril formation of amyloid beta-peptides (Abeta(40) and Abeta(42)) far below the stoichiometric ratio. Kinetic experiments show that a main effect of BRICHOS is to prolong the lag time in a concentration-dependent, quantitative, and reproducible manner. An ongoing aggregation process is retarded if BRICHOS is added at any time during the lag phase, but it is too late to interfere at the end of the process. Results from circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy, as well as analytical size exclusion chromatography, imply that Abeta is maintained as an unstructured monomer during the extended lag phase in the presence of BRICHOS. Electron microscopy shows that although the process is delayed, typical amyloid fibrils are eventually formed also when BRICHOS is present. Structural BRICHOS models display a conserved array of tyrosine rings on a five-stranded beta-sheet, with inter-hydroxyl distances suited for hydrogen-bonding peptides in an extended beta-conformation. Our data imply that the inhibitory mechanism is reliant on BRICHOS interfering with molecular events during the lag phase.

22801501|t|A mutation in APP protects against Alzheimer's disease and age-related cognitive decline.
22801501|a|The prevalence of dementia in the Western world in people over the age of 60 has been estimated to be greater than 5%, about two-thirds of which are due to Alzheimer's disease. The age-specific prevalence of Alzheimer's disease nearly doubles every 5 years after age 65, leading to a prevalence of greater than 25% in those over the age of 90 (ref. 3). Here, to search for low-frequency variants in the amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) gene with a significant effect on the risk of Alzheimer's disease, we studied coding variants in APP in a set of whole-genome sequence data from 1,795 Icelanders. We found a coding mutation (A673T) in the APP gene that protects against Alzheimer's disease and cognitive decline in the elderly without Alzheimer's disease. This substitution is adjacent to the aspartyl protease beta-site in APP, and results in an approximately 40% reduction in the formation of amyloidogenic peptides in vitro. The strong protective effect of the A673T substitution against Alzheimer's disease provides proof of principle for the hypothesis that reducing the beta-cleavage of APP may protect against the disease. Furthermore, as the A673T allele also protects against cognitive decline in the elderly without Alzheimer's disease, the two may be mediated through the same or similar mechanisms.

22801723|t|Plasma biomarkers associated with the apolipoprotein E genotype and Alzheimer disease.
22801723|a|BACKGROUND: A blood-based test that could be used as a screen for Alzheimer disease (AD) may enable early intervention and better access to treatment. OBJECTIVE: To apply a multiplex immunoassay panel to identify plasma biomarkers of AD using plasma samples from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: The Biomarkers Consortium Alzheimer's Disease Plasma Proteomics Project. PARTICIPANTS: Plasma samples at baseline and at 1 year were analyzed from 396 (345 at 1 year) patients with mild cognitive impairment, 112 (97 at 1 year) patients with AD, and 58 (54 at 1 year) healthy control subjects. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Multivariate and univariate statistical analyses were used to examine differences across diagnostic groups and relative to the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype. RESULTS: Increased levels of eotaxin 3, pancreatic polypeptide, and N-terminal protein B-type brain natriuretic peptide were observed in patients, confirming similar changes reported in cerebrospinal fluid samples of patients with AD and MCI. Increases in tenascin C levels and decreases in IgM and ApoE levels were also observed. All participants with Apo epsilon3/epsilon4 or epsilon4/epsilon4 alleles showed a distinct biochemical profile characterized by low C-reactive protein and ApoE levels and by high cortisol, interleukin 13, apolipoprotein B, and gamma interferon levels. The use of plasma biomarkers improved specificity in differentiating patients with AD from controls, and ApoE plasma levels were lowest in patients whose mild cognitive impairment had progressed to dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma biomarker results confirm cerebrospinal fluid studies reporting increased levels of pancreatic polypeptide and N-terminal protein B-type brain natriuretic peptide in patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment. Incorporation of plasma biomarkers yielded high sensitivity with improved specificity, supporting their usefulness as a screening tool. The ApoE genotype was associated with a unique biochemical profile irrespective of diagnosis, highlighting the importance of genotype on blood protein profiles.

22801784|t|Potential use of gamma-secretase modulators in the treatment of Alzheimer disease.
22801784|a|Although significant progress has occurred in the past 20 years regarding our understanding of Alzheimer disease pathogenesis, we have yet to identify disease-modifying therapeutics capable of substantially altering the clinical course of this prevalent neurodegenerative disease. In this short review, we discuss 2 approaches that are currently being tested clinically (gamma-secretase inhibition and gamma-secretase modulation) and emphasize the significant differences between these 2 therapeutic approaches. We also discuss certain genetic- and biomarker-based translational and clinical trial paradigms that may assist in developing a useful therapeutic agent.

22803680|t|Continuous flow reactor for the production of stable amyloid protein oligomers.
22803680|a|The predominant working hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease is that the proximate pathologic agents are oligomers of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta). "Oligomer" is an ill-defined term. Many different types of oligomers have been reported, and they often exist in rapid equilibrium with monomers and higher-order assemblies. This has made formal structure-activity determinations difficult. Recently, Ono et al. [Ono, K., et al. (2009) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 106, 14745-14750] used rapid, zero-length, in situ chemical cross-linking to stabilize the oligomer state, allowing the isolation and study of pure populations of oligomers of a specific order (number of Abeta monomers per assembly). This approach was successful but highly laborious and time-consuming, precluding general application of the method. To overcome these difficulties, we developed a "continuous flow reactor" with the ability to produce theoretically unlimited quantities of chemically stabilized Abeta oligomers. We show, in addition to its utility for Abeta, that this method can be applied to a wide range of other amyloid-forming proteins.

22804558|t|Mass spectral studies reveal the structure of Abeta1-16-Cu2+ complex resembling ATCUN motif.
22804558|a|In Alzheimer's disease, copper binds to amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide and generates oxidative stress. The coordination of histidine (His) residues to Cu(2+) is still uncertain. We studied Cu(2+) binding to Abeta1-16 peptide using the diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) assay and mass spectrometry. Our results show that only one His is involved in Cu(2+) coordination, which is identified as His6 using mass spectral studies. Novel nickel displacement studies have further supported the proposal that the Cu(2+) binding site of Abeta1-16 peptide resembles the ATCUN motif of human serum albumin.

22805236|t|Bepridil decreases Abeta and calcium levels in the thalamus after middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats.
22805236|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebral ischaemia share similar features in terms of altered amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation. We have previously shown that Abeta and calcium deposition, and beta-secretase activity, are robustly increased in the ipsilateral thalamus after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. Here, we investigated whether the non-selective calcium channel blocker bepridil, which also inhibits beta-secretase cleavage of APP, affects thalamic accumulation of Abeta and calcium and in turn influences functional recovery in rats subjected to MCAO. A 27-day bepridil treatment (50 mg/kg, p.o.) initiated 2 days after MCAO significantly decreased the levels of soluble Abeta40, Abeta42 and calcium in the ipsilateral thalamus, as compared with vehicle-treated MCAO rats. Expression of seladin-1/DHCR24 protein, which is a potential protective factor against neuronal damage, was decreased at both mRNA and protein levels in the ipsilateral thalamus of MCAO rats. Conversely, bepridil treatment restored seladin-1/DHCR24 expression in the ipsilateral thalamus. Bepridil treatment did not significantly affect heme oxygenase-1- or NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase-1-mediated oxidative stress or inflammatory responses in the ipsilateral thalamus of MCAO rats. Finally, bepridil treatment mitigated MCAO-induced alterations in APP processing in the ipsilateral thalamus and improved contralateral forelimb use in MCAO rats. These findings suggest that bepridil is a plausible therapeutic candidate in AD or stroke owing to its multifunctional role in key cellular events that are relevant for the pathogenesis of these diseases.

22805771|t|Stable size distribution of amyloid plaques over the course of Alzheimer disease.
22805771|a|Amyloid beta plaques are a key pathologic feature of Alzheimer disease (AD), but whether plaque sizes increase or stabilize over the course of AD is unknown. We measured the size distribution of total immunoreactive (10D5-positive) and dense-core (Thioflavin S-positive) plaques in the temporal neocortex of a large group of subjects with AD and age-matched plaque-bearing subjects without dementia to test the hypothesis that amyloid plaques continue to grow along with the progression of the disease. The size of amyloid beta (10D5)-positive plaques did not differ between groups, whereas dense-core plaques from the group with AD were slightly larger than those from the group without dementia (~25%-30%, p = 0.01). Within the group with AD, dense-core plaque size did not independently correlate with duration of clinical disease (from 4 to 21 years, p = 0.68), whereas 10D5-positive plaque size correlated negatively with disease duration (p = 0.01). By contrast, an earlier age of symptom onset strongly predicted a larger postmortem plaque size; this effect was independent of disease duration and the presence of the APOE[Latin Small Letter Open E]4 allele (p = 0.0001). We conclude that plaques vary in size among patients, with larger size distributions correlating with an earlier age of onset, but plaques do not substantially increase in size over the clinical course of the disease.

22805778|t|Characteristics of aquaporin expression surrounding senile plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy in Alzheimer disease.
22805778|a|Senile plaques (SPs) containing amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) 1-42 are the major species present in Alzheimer disease (AD), whereas Abeta1-40 is the major constituent of arteriolar walls affected by cerebral amyloid angiopathy. The water channel proteins astrocytic aquaporin 1 (AQP1) and aquaporin 4 (AQP4) are known to be abnormally expressed in AD brains, but the expression of AQPs surrounding SPs and cerebral amyloid angiopathy has not been described in detail. Here, we investigated whether AQP expression is associated with each species of Abeta deposited in human brains affected by either sporadic or familial AD. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated more numerous AQP1-positive reactive astrocytes in the AD cerebral cortex than in controls, located close to Abeta42- or Abeta40-positive SPs. In AD cases, however, AQP1-positive astrocytes were not often observed in Abeta-rich areas, and there was a significant negative correlation between the levels of AQP1 and Abeta42 assessed semiquantitatively. We also found that Abeta plaque-like AQP4 was distributed in association with Abeta42- or Abeta40-positive SPs and that the degree of AQP4 expression around Abeta40-positive vessels was variable. These findings suggest that a defined population of AQP1-positive reactive astrocytes may modify Abeta deposition in the AD brain, whereas the Abeta deposition process might alter astrocytic expression of AQP4.

22810090|t|Increase in platelet immunoglobulin in Alzheimer's disease is normalised following cholinesterase inhibitor treatment: preliminary results.
22810090|a|We report a 16.5% increase in platelet immunoglobulin (Ig) content in subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in relation to cognitively intact individuals (p = 0.021), whereas the plasma Ig levels were unaltered (p = 0.428). The upregulation of platelet Ig was not explained by age, duration of dementia, or degree of cognitive impairment. However, AD subjects treated with cholinesterase inhibitors (n = 21) had lower levels of platelet Ig (p = 0.009) than AD subjects not treated with anti-dementia drugs (n = 4) and similar to those of control subjects (n = 24; p = 0.069). The anti-dementia treatment did not influence the plasma Ig levels (p = 0.177). These preliminary findings require further confirmation in studies on larger number of AD subjects with various stages of cognitive impairment, and who would be assessed prior to initiation of and during cholinesterase inhibitor treatment.

22810092|t|5-HT4 receptor stimulation leads to soluble AbetaPPalpha production through MMP-9 upregulation.
22810092|a|Serotonin 4 (5-HT4) receptor signaling does not only have the physiological function of improving cognition, but might also be helpful in the therapy of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through regulation of the production of soluble amyloid-beta protein precursor alpha (sAbetaPPalpha). To analyze the relationship between 5-HT4 receptor signaling and sAbetaPPalpha production, we stably transfected H4 cells with AbetaPP and 5-HT4 receptor (H4/AbetaPP/5-HT4 cells). We found that 24-h incubation with the 5-HT4 receptor agonist RS-67333 upregulates matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). Furthermore, MMP-9 overexpression enhanced sAbetaPPalpha levels, whereas knockdown with MMP-9 siRNA decreased sAbetaPPalpha levels. When RS-67333 was injected for 10 days in Tg2576 mice, a model of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) deposition, there was an increase in hippocampal levels of sAbetaPPalpha, C-terminal fragment alpha, and MMP-9, as well as a decrease in hippocampal senile plaque number and levels of the 40 amino acid peptide, Abeta40. Taken all together, these experiments demonstrate that 5-HT4 receptor stimulation induces expression of MMP-9 which cleaves AbetaPP through alpha-secretase-like activity, leading to an increase of sAbetaPPalpha levels and a reduction of Abeta load.

22810097|t|Transforming growth factor beta1 modulates amyloid beta-induced glial activation through the Smad3-dependent induction of MAPK phosphatase-1.
22810097|a|Chronic neuroinflammation has been proposed as a driving force for Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is characterized by amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal loss, and activation of glial cells. Persistent activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathway has been reported, which induces an increased expression of inflammatory mediators. Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1) is an inflammation modulator whose levels are increased in AD. However, its canonical signaling pathway, Smad, appears to be impaired. Our previous findings indicate that TGFbeta1 plays a key role in the pathogenesis of neuroinflammation, but the molecular mechanisms underlying its effects are not completely elucidated. Here, we studied the potential role of MKP-1, a phosphatase that exerts negative regulation on MAPK signaling, in the modulatory actions of TGFbeta1. Using rat primary glial cultures, we found that pretreatment with TGFbeta1 for 48 h reduced the production of inflammatory mediators induced by Abeta42, a result that was associated with prevention of MAPK p38 activation, attenuation of NF-kappaB p65 nuclear translocation, and an increase in MKP-1 levels. Moreover, suppression of MKP-1 expression by siRNA and inhibition of Smad3 reversed the modulation of inflammatory response exerted by TGFbeta1. These results indicate that TGFbeta1 induces the expression of MKP-1 in glial cells through the Smad pathway and inhibits MAPK and NF-kappaB signaling, thus revealing a novel mechanism for the neuroprotective actions of TGFbeta1. Further research would be important in order to characterize the role of this mechanism in the pathogenesis of AD.

22810102|t|Highly pathogenic Alzheimer's disease presenilin 1 P117R mutation causes a specific increase in p53 and p21 protein levels and cell cycle dysregulation in human lymphocytes.
22810102|a|Cell cycle (CC) reentry in neurons precedes the formation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). CC alterations were also detected in lymphocytes from sporadic AD patients. In the present study, we investigated the influence of nine presenilin 1 (PS1) mutations (P117R, M139V, L153V, H163R, S170F, F177L, I213F, L226F, E318G) on CC and Abeta production in immortalized B-lymphocytes from familial AD (FAD) patients and in stably transfected human embryonic kidney cells. In both cell types, only the P117R mutation increased levels of key G1/S phase regulatory proteins, p53, and its effector p21, causing G1 phase prolongation with simultaneous S phase shortening, and lowering basal apoptosis. The CC changes were rescued by inhibition of p53, but not of gamma-secretase. Moreover, the investigated PS1 mutants showed differences in the increased levels of secreted Abeta40 and Abeta42 and in Abeta42/Abeta40 ratios, but these differences did not correlate with CC patterns. Altogether, we found that both CC regulation and Abeta production differentiate PS1 mutations, and that CC PS1 activity is mediated by p53/p21 signaling but not by gamma-secretase activity. The identified CC dysregulation linked with increased p53 and p21 protein levels distinguishes the highly pathogenic PS1 P117R mutation and may contribute to the specific severity of the clinical progression of FAD associated with the mutation in the PS1 117 site. These findings suggest that impairment in lymphocyte CC might play a pathogenic function in AD and are relevant to the development of new diagnostic approaches and personalized therapeutic strategies.

22814208|t|Impact of beta-amyloid-specific florbetaben PET imaging on confidence in early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
22814208|a|BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) may be corroborated by imaging of beta-amyloid plaques using positron emission tomography (PET). Here, we performed an add-on questionnaire study to evaluate the relevance of florbetaben imaging (BAY 949172) in diagnosis and consecutive management of probable AD patients. METHODS: AD patients with a clinical diagnosis in accordance with the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria or controls were imaged using florbetaben. Referring physicians were asked on a voluntary basis about their confidence in initial diagnosis, significance of PET imaging results, and their anticipated consequences for future patient care. RESULTS: 121 questionnaires for probable AD patients and 80 questionnaires for controls were evaluated. In 18% of patients who had initially received the diagnosis of probable AD, PET scans were rated negative, whereas in controls 18% of scans were positive. An increase in confidence in the initial diagnosis was frequently reported (80%). Imaging results had a significant impact on the intended patient care, as judged by the referring physicians; this was most prominent in those patients with a contradicting scan and/or a low confidence in the initial diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Florbetaben amyloid imaging increases the overall confidence in diagnosis of AD and may frequently influence clinical decisions and patient management.

22814377|t|Molecular basis of beta-amyloid oligomer recognition with a conformational antibody fragment.
22814377|a|Oligomers are intermediates of the beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide fibrillogenic pathway and are putative pathogenic culprits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we report the biotechnological generation and biochemical characterization of an oligomer-specific antibody fragment, KW1. KW1 not only discriminates between oligomers and other Abeta conformations, such as fibrils or disaggregated peptide; it also differentiates between different types of Abeta oligomers, such as those formed by Abeta (1-40) and Abeta (1-42) peptide. This high selectivity of binding contrasts sharply with many other conformational antibodies that interact with a large number of structurally analogous but sequentially different antigens. X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and peptide array measurements imply that KW1 recognizes oligomers through a hydrophobic and significantly aromatic surface motif that includes Abeta residues 18-20. KW1-positive oligomers occur in human AD brain samples and induce synaptic dysfunctions in living brain tissues. Bivalent KW1 potently neutralizes this effect and interferes with Abeta assembly. By altering a specific step of the fibrillogenic cascade, it prevents the formation of mature Abeta fibrils and induces the accumulation of nonfibrillar aggregates. Our data illuminate significant mechanistic differences in oligomeric and fibril recognition and suggest the considerable potential of KW1 in future studies to detect or inhibit specific types of Abeta conformers.

22814602|t|Hibris, a Drosophila nephrin homolog, is required for presenilin-mediated Notch and APP-like cleavages.
22814602|a|Drosophila Hibris (Hbs), a member of the Nephrin Immunoglobulin Super Family, has been implicated in myogenesis and eye patterning. Here, we uncover a role of Hbs in Notch (N) signaling and gamma-secretase processing. Loss of hbs results in classical N-signaling-associated phenotypes in Drosophila, including eye patterning, wing margin, and sensory organ specification defects. In particular, hbs mutant larvae display altered gamma-secretase-dependent Notch proteolytic processing. Hbs also interacts molecularly and genetically with Presenilin (Psn) and other components of the gamma-secretase complex. This Hbs function appears conserved, as mammalian Nephrin also promotes N signaling in mammalian cells. Our data suggest that Hbs is required for Psn maturation. Consistent with its role in Psn processing, Hbs genetically interacts with the Drosophila beta-amyloid protein precursor-like (Appl) protein, the homolog of mammalian APP, the cleavage of which is associated with Alzheimer's disease. Thus, Hbs/Nephrin appear to share a general requirement in Psn/gamma-secretase regulation and associated processes.

22815077|t|Disease modifying drugs targeting beta-amyloid.
22815077|a|At this time there are no effective methods to alter the disease course in Alzheimer's disease. All FDA approved interventions are for symptomatic relief only. However, it is an exciting time as many agents in development have theorhetical potential to impact the disease course. This review discusses some of the agents that have been in clinical trials, particularly those that affect amyloid processing. Some agents have failed while others still provide hope. Since amyloid is the peptide most closely linked to disease pathogenesis, it is possible that some of the anti-amyloid agents will impact the disease progression in a meaningful way.

22815492|t|Reducing amyloid-related Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis by a small molecule targeting filamin A.
22815492|a|PTI-125 is a novel compound demonstrating a promising new approach to treating Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterized by neurodegeneration and amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary pathologies. We show that the toxic signaling of amyloid-beta(42) (Abeta(42)) by the alpha7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7nAChR), which results in tau phosphorylation and formation of neurofibrillary tangles, requires the recruitment of the scaffolding protein filamin A (FLNA). By binding FLNA with high affinity, PTI-125 prevents Abeta(42)'s toxic cascade, decreasing phospho-tau and Abeta aggregates and reducing the dysfunction of alpha7nAChRs, NMDARs, and insulin receptors. PTI-125 prevents Abeta(42) signaling by drastically reducing its affinity for alpha7nAChRs and can even dissociate existing Abeta(42)-alpha7nAChR complexes. Additionally, PTI-125 prevents Abeta-induced inflammatory cytokine release by blocking FLNA recruitment to toll-like receptor 4, illustrating an anti-inflammatory effect. PTI-125's broad spectrum of beneficial effects is demonstrated here in an intracerebroventricular Abeta(42) infusion mouse model of AD and in human postmortem AD brain tissue.

22816379|t|Multiple low-dose infusions of human umbilical cord blood cells improve cognitive impairments and reduce amyloid-beta-associated neuropathology in Alzheimer mice.
22816379|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common progressive age-related dementia in the elderly and the fourth major cause of disability and mortality in that population. The disease is pathologically characterized by deposition of beta-amyloid plaques neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Current strategies for the treatment of AD are symptomatic only. As such, they are less than efficacious in terms of significantly slowing or halting the underlying pathophysiological progression of the disease. Modulation by cell therapy may be new promising disease-modifying therapy. Recently, we showed reduction in amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels/beta-amyloid plaques and associated astrocytosis following low-dose infusions of mononuclear human umbilical cord blood cells (HUCBCs). Our current study extended our previous findings by examining cognition via (1) the rotarod test, (2) a 2-day version of the radial-arm water maze test, and (3) a subsequent observation in an open pool platform test to characterize the effects of monthly peripheral HUCBC infusion (1x10(6) cells/muL) into the transgenic PSAPP mouse model of cerebral amyloidosis (bearing mutant human APP and presenilin-1 transgenes) from 6 to 12 months of age. We show that HUCBC therapy correlates with decreased (1) cognitive impairment, (2) Abeta levels/beta-amyloid plaques, (3) amyloidogenic APP processing, and (4) reactive microgliosis after a treatment of 6 or 10 months. As such, this report lays the groundwork for an HUCBC therapy as potentially novel alternative to oppose AD at the disease-modifying level.

22817324|t|Age-related modulation of gamma-secretase activity in non-human primate brains.
22817324|a|Age-dependent accumulation of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) in the brain is a pre-condition for development of Alzheimer's disease. A relative increase in the generation of longer Abeta species such as Abeta42 and Abeta43 is critical for Abeta deposition, but the underlying mechanism remains unresolved. Here, we performed a cell-free assay using microsome fractions of temporal cortex tissues from 42 cynomolgus monkeys and found that Abeta40-generating gamma-secretase activity (gamma40) decreased with age, whereas Abeta42-generating gamma-secretase activity (gamma42) was unaltered. In ELISAs, more than 80% of monkeys over 20-years old showed evidence of Abeta accumulation in the temporal cortex. The ratio of gamma42 to gamma40 increased with age and correlated with the level of accumulated Abeta. These results suggest that gamma-secretase activity undergoes age-related, non-genetic modulation and that this modulation may cause Abeta accumulation in aging brains. Similar modulation may predispose aged human brains to Alzheimer's disease.

22817896|t|The RIP1/RIP3 necrosome forms a functional amyloid signaling complex required for programmed necrosis.
22817896|a|RIP1 and RIP3 kinases are central players in TNF-induced programmed necrosis. Here, we report that the RIP homotypic interaction motifs (RHIMs) of RIP1 and RIP3 mediate the assembly of heterodimeric filamentous structures. The fibrils exhibit classical characteristics of beta-amyloids, as shown by Thioflavin T (ThT) and Congo red (CR) binding, circular dichroism, infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and solid-state NMR. Structured amyloid cores are mapped in RIP1 and RIP3 that are flanked by regions of mobility. The endogenous RIP1/RIP3 complex isolated from necrotic cells binds ThT, is ultrastable, and has a fibrillar core structure, whereas necrosis is partially inhibited by ThT, CR, and another amyloid dye, HBX. Mutations in the RHIMs of RIP1 and RIP3 that are defective in the interaction compromise cluster formation, kinase activation, and programmed necrosis in vivo. The current study provides insight into the structural changes that occur when RIP kinases are triggered to execute different signaling outcomes and expands the realm of amyloids to complex formation and signaling.

22819135|t|Effects of mild chronic cerebral hypoperfusion and early amyloid pathology on spatial learning and the cellular innate immune response in mice.
22819135|a|Understanding the contribution of cerebrovascular factors in the progression of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a key step for the development of preventive therapies. Among these factors, chronic cerebral hypoperfusion is an early component of AD pathogenesis that can predict the progression from mild cognitive impairment to AD. Here, we investigated the effects of a protocol of mild chronic cerebral hypoperfusion in the APPswe/PS1 transgenic mouse model of AD. We observed that the permanent occlusion of the right common carotid artery induced spatial learning impairments in young APPswe/PS1 mice, but not in their wild type littermates. Furthermore, the extent of learning deficits strongly correlated with the number of cortical beta-amyloid plaques, with the mobilization of monocytes into the blood and with the number of bone marrow-derived microglia in the brain. These results indicate that a mild reduction of cerebral blood flow can selectively induce cognitive deficits at an early stage of amyloid pathology, eliciting a cellular innate immune response, even without causing neuronal death.

22819136|t|Detecting spatial memory deficits beyond blindness in tg2576 Alzheimer mice.
22819136|a|The retinal degeneration Pde6b(rd1) (rd) mutation can be a major pitfall in behavioral studies using tg2576 mice bred on a B6:SJL genetic background, 1 of the most widely used models of Alzheimer's disease. After a pilot study in wild type mice, performance of 8- and 16-month-old tg2576 mice were assessed in several behavioral tasks with the challenge of selecting 1 or more task(s) showing robust memory deficits on this genetic background. Water maze acquisition was impossible in rd homozygotes, whereas Y-maze alternation, object recognition, and olfactory discrimination were unaffected by both the transgene and the rd mutation. Spatial memory retention of 8- and 16-month-old tg2576 mice, however, was dramatically affected independently of the rd mutation when mice had to recognize a spatial configuration of objects or to perform the Barnes maze. Thus, the latter tasks appear extremely useful to evaluate spatial memory deficits and to test cognitive therapies in tg2576 mice and other mouse models bred on a background susceptible to visual impairment.

At pH 7.4, the affinity of Cu(II) for this ligand is approximately 4 x 10(14)M(-1). Coordination of redox active metal ions such as copper or iron to the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide has been linked to deleterious processes encountered in the etiology of Alzheimer disease (AD), such as Abeta aggregation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In this context, the ability of the H(2)L(2-) to extract Cu(II) from Cu(Abeta) species where Abeta is the peptide involved in AD, is reported as well as its capacity to redox silence the Cu(Abeta) induced ROS formation and to prevent Cu(II)-induced Abeta aggregation. Such water soluble sulfonato-derivatives of Cu(II) chelators are very interesting counterparts for in vitro study of chelators' properties required to attend further biological applications as therapeutic tools against AD.

22820466|t|Alzheimer amyloid-beta oligomer bound to postsynaptic prion protein activates Fyn to impair neurons.
22820466|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers are thought to trigger Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. Cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) selectively binds oligomeric Abeta and can mediate Alzheimer's disease-related phenotypes. We examined the specificity, distribution and signaling of Abeta-PrP(C) complexes, seeking to understand how they might alter the function of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) in neurons. PrP(C) is enriched in postsynaptic densities, and Abeta-PrP(C) interaction leads to Fyn kinase activation. Soluble Abeta assemblies derived from the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease interacted with PrP(C) to activate Fyn. Abeta engagement of PrP(C)-Fyn signaling yielded phosphorylation of the NR2B subunit of NMDARs, which was coupled to an initial increase and then a loss of surface NMDARs. Abeta-induced dendritic spine loss and lactate dehydrogenase release required both PrP(C) and Fyn, and human familial Alzheimer's disease transgene-induced convulsive seizures did not occur in mice lacking PrP(C). These results delineate an Abeta oligomer signal transduction pathway that requires PrP(C) and Fyn to alter synaptic function, with deleterious consequences in Alzheimer's disease.

22823461|t|Structural origin of polymorphism of Alzheimer's amyloid beta-fibrils.
22823461|a|Formation of senile plaques containing amyloid fibrils of Abeta (amyloid beta-peptide) is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Unlike globular proteins, which fold into unique structures, the fibrils of Abeta and other amyloid proteins often contain multiple polymorphs. Polymorphism of amyloid fibrils leads to different toxicity in amyloid diseases and may be the basis for prion strains, but the structural origin for fibril polymorphism is still elusive. In the present study we investigate the structural origin of two major fibril polymorphs of Abeta40: an untwisted polymorph formed under agitated conditions and a twisted polymorph formed under quiescent conditions. Using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we studied the inter-strand side-chain interactions at 14 spin-labelled positions in the Abeta40 sequence. The results of the present study show that the agitated fibrils have stronger inter-strand spin-spin interactions at most of the residue positions investigated. The two hydrophobic regions at residues 17-20 and 31-36 have the strongest interactions in agitated fibrils. Distance estimates on the basis of the spin exchange frequencies suggest that inter-strand distances at residues 17, 20, 32, 34 and 36 in agitated fibrils are approximately 0.2 A (1 A=0.1 nm) closer than in quiescent fibrils. We propose that the strength of inter-strand side-chain interactions determines the degree of beta-sheet twist, which then leads to the different association patterns between different cross beta-units and thus distinct fibril morphologies. Therefore the inter-strand side-chain interaction may be a structural origin for fibril polymorphism in Abeta and other amyloid proteins.

22824463|t|Memantine prevents cognitive impairment and reduces Bcl-2 and caspase 8 immunoreactivity in rats injected with amyloid beta1-40.
22824463|a|Amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) can trigger apoptotic cascades in neurons. We found previously that memantine, an uncompetitive antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors approved for the treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease, can prevent neurodegeneration induced by intracranial Abeta(1-40) injection. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that memantine prevents Abeta(1-40)-mediated cognitive impairment, neurodegeneration, and apoptosis of hippocampal neurons in rats. In addition, we hypothesized that Abeta(1-40) injection would induce changes in the levels of one or more apoptosis-related proteins, and that these changes would be attenuated by memantine treatment. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were administered memantine (continuous subcutaneous application, 9.6-14.4mg/kg/day; n=8) or vehicle (water; n=8) for 9 days. Two days after treatment initiation, the animals were bilaterally injected with Abeta(1-40) into the CA1/DG region of the hippocampus, subjected to active avoidance testing for 7 days, and sacrificed for immunohistochemical examination of four caspases (3, 6, 8, and 9) and three proteins of the Bcl-2 family (Bcl-2, Bax, and Bad). Injection of Abeta resulted in neurodegeneration, DNA fragmentation, increased Bcl-2 immunostaining, and significantly impaired performance in an active avoidance task, all which were significantly attenuated in rats treated with memantine. No differences in immunoreactivity of caspases 3, 6, 8, and 9 were discovered between groups after 7 days. Additional experiments demonstrated that an increase in caspase 8 immunostaining, observed 3 days after Abeta(1-40) injection, was significantly attenuated in memantine-treated rats. These data suggest that, in rats, memantine can prevent amyloid-triggered expression of apoptosis-related markers and concomitant cognitive deficits.

22832069|t|Structural basis behind the interaction of Zn2+ with the protein alpha-synuclein and the Abeta peptide: a comparative analysis.
22832069|a|alpha-Synuclein (AS) aggregation is associated to neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD). At the same time, alterations in metal ion homeostasis may play a pivotal role in the progression of AS amyloid assembly and the onset of PD. Elucidation of the structural basis directing AS-metal interactions and their effect on AS aggregation constitutes a key step towards understanding the role of metal ions in AS amyloid formation and neurodegeneration. Despite of the reported evidences that link Zn(2+) with the pathophysiology of PD and the fact that this metal ion was shown to promote AS fibrillation in vitro, neither the structural characterization of the binding sites nor the identification of the amino acids involved in the interaction of Zn(2+) with the protein AS has been carried out. By using NMR spectroscopy, we have addressed here unknown structural details related to the binding of Zn(2+) to the protein AS through the design of site-directed and domain truncated mutants of AS. The binding of zinc to the Abeta peptide was also studied and discussed comparatively. Although the results of this study contribute to the understanding of the structural and molecular basis behind the acceleration of AS fibrillation mediated by Zn(2+), the low affinity that characterizes the interaction of Zn(2+) with AS contrasts strongly with the high-affinity features reported for the binding of this metal ion to other target proteins linked to human amylodosis such as Abeta peptide and the Islet Amyloid Polypeptide (IAPP), challenging the biological relevance of zinc interactions in the pathogenesis of PD.

22832482|t|Prenatal and early sucking influences on dietary preference in newborn, weaning, and young adult cats.
22832482|a|Early experiences are of potential importance in shaping long-term behavior. This study examined the relative influence of prenatal and/or early postnatal experience of chemosensory stimuli on subsequent olfactory and dietary preferences of cats as newborns, at 9-10 weeks, and at 6 months. Cats were exposed to vanillin or 4-ethylguaiacol via their mother's diet either prenatally, postnatally, perinatally (prenatal and postnatal), or experienced no exposure to the stimuli (control). Newborns were given a two-choice olfactory test between the familiar "odor" and no odor; 9-10 week olds were tested for their preference between two food treats, one flavored with the familiar stimulus and the other unflavored; at 6 months, cats were given a choice of two bowls of food, one flavored with the familiar stimulus and the other unflavored. At all ages, cats preferred the familiar, and avoided the unfamiliar, stimulus. Perinatal exposure exerted the strongest influence on preference. Prenatal exposure influenced preference at all ages and postnatal exposure exerted a stronger effect as the cat aged. We conclude that long-term chemosensory and dietary preferences of cats are influenced by prenatal and early (nursing) postnatal experience, supporting a natural and biologically relevant mechanism for the safe transmission of diet from mother to young.

22832950|t|Neuroprotective effects of new protein kinase C activator TPPB against Abeta25-35 induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells.
22832950|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is pathologically characterized by presence of senile plaques in the hippocampus, which are composed mainly of extracellular deposition of a polypeptide known as the beta amyloid, the Abeta. It has been demonstrated on numerous occasions that it was the deposition and aggregation of this Abeta peptide that cause neuronal dysfunction and even finally, the dementia. Lowering the deposition of Abeta or decreasing its neurotoxicity has long been one of the purposes of AD therapy. In previous study, we reported that protein kinase C (PKC) activator TPPB could regulate APP processing by increasing alpha-secretase activity. In this study we further investigated the potential neuroprotective effect of TPPB against Abeta(25-35)-induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells. The results indicated that TPPB at concentration of 1 muM could antagonize Abeta(25-35) induced cell damage as evidenced by MTT assays, LDH release and by morphological changes. Furthermore, the neuroprotection in cell viability can be blocked by inhibitors of PKC, Akt and MAPK. The experiment also indicated that TPPB could increase the phosphorylation of Akt, PKC, MARCKS and MAPK, which were inhibited by Abeta(25-35) treatment. Finally, TPPB inhibited the activation of caspase-3 induced by Abeta(25-35). Taken together, the experiment here implies that TPPB has a role against Abeta(25-35)-induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells and may suggest its therapeutic potential in AD.

22834819|t|Kinetics of amyloid and prion fibril formation in the absence and presence of dense shell sugar-decorated dendrimers.
22834819|a|The aggregation behavior of the amyloid peptide Abeta(1-28) and the prion peptide PrP(185-208) - both responsible for neurodegenerative disorders - was analyzed in the absence and in the presence of poly(propylene imine) (PPI) dendrimers at generation 5 (G5) with a dense shell of maltose and maltotriose units. Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence assay and circular dichroism (CD) experiments indicated that fibril formation is enhanced at low dendrimer concentration, while it is prevented at relatively high dendrimer concentrations. Computer aided EPR analysis by means of the selected spin probe 4-octyl-dimethylammonium,2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidine-1-oxyl bromide (CAT8) further demonstrated this behavior, but also provided detailed information on the mechanism of fibril formation and on the different behavior of the differently decorated dendrimers. The CAT8 radicals were progressively trapped at the peptide interphase when peptide aggregates were formed, also monitoring pre-fibrillar structures. At later time, a phase separation of the CAT8 radicals monitors the formation of further supramolecular structures where the probes become squeezed among fibrillar aggregates. The addition of small amounts of dendrimers promotes the formation of peptide fibrils breaking them and providing a larger amount of ends that serve as sites of replications. Conversely, a high amount of dendrimers allows the peptides to well separate from each other such preventing their aggregation. EPR results also indicate that the perturbation played by PPI(G5)-Maltose are more effective onto PrP(185-208) than onto Abeta(1-28), while PPI(G5)-Maltotriose is less effective towards PrP(185-208) in both promoting aggregation and preventing it by changing the dendrimer concentration. These results provide useful information about the mechanism and interactions which regulate the ability of macromolecules like the dendrimers to favor, prevent or cure neurodegenerative diseases.

22836248|t|alpha-Synuclein inhibits intersynaptic vesicle mobility and maintains recycling-pool homeostasis.
22836248|a|Although the presynaptic protein alpha-synuclein is a recognized player in neurodegeneration, its precise physiologic function(s) and/or role in human disease remains unclear. An emerging consensus from previous studies in lower-order systems is that alpha-synuclein interferes with vesicle-trafficking pathways; however putative neuronal correlates are unknown. Here we explore consequences of alpha-synuclein modulation in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons; coupling alpha-synuclein overexpression and knock-out model-systems with contemporary imaging paradigms. Our studies reveal an unexpected role of alpha-synuclein in attenuating the mobility of recycling pool (RP) vesicles between presynaptic boutons--called "superpool" trafficking--and also in maintaining the overall size of RPs at synapses. While an excess of alpha-synuclein led to smaller RPs and inhibited intersynaptic trafficking, an absence of alpha-synuclein triggered converse changes with larger RPs and enhanced intersynaptic trafficking. The data collectively suggest a model where alpha-synuclein maintains RP homeostasis by modulating intersynaptic vesicular dynamics, and provide a putative neuronal correlate of alpha-synuclein-induced impairments in vesicle-trafficking previously reported in lower-order systems.

22836251|t|Pan-neuronal expression of APL-1, an APP-related protein, disrupts olfactory, gustatory, and touch plasticity in Caenorhabditis elegans.
22836251|a|Patients with Alzheimer's disease show age-related cognitive decline. Postmortem autopsy of their brains shows the presence of large numbers of senile plaques, whose major component is the beta-amyloid peptide. The beta-amyloid peptide is a cleavage product of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). In addition to the neurodegeneration associated with beta-amyloid aggregation in Alzheimer's disease patients, mutations in APP in mammalian model organisms have also been shown to disrupt several behaviors independent of visible amyloid plaque formation. However, the pathways in which APP function are unknown and difficult to unravel in mammals. Here we show that pan-neuronal expression of APL-1, the Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of APP, disrupts several behaviors, such as olfactory and gustatory learning behavior and touch habituation. These behaviors are mediated by distinct neural circuits, suggesting a broad impact of APL-1 on sensory plasticity in C. elegans. Furthermore, we found that disruption of these three behaviors requires activity of the TGFbeta pathway and reduced activity of the insulin pathway. These results suggest pathways and molecular components that may underlie behavioral plasticity in mammals and in patients with Alzheimer's disease.

22836259|t|Soluble alpha-synuclein is a novel modulator of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology.
22836259|a|Recent evidence has emphasized soluble species of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau as pathogenic effectors in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite the fact that Abeta, tau, and alpha-synuclein (alphaSyn) can promote each other's aggregation, the potential contribution of soluble alphaSyn to AD pathogenesis is unknown. Here, we found an approximate twofold increase over controls in soluble alphaSyn levels in AD brains in the absence of Lewy body cytopathology. Importantly, soluble alphaSyn levels were a quantitatively stronger correlate of cognitive impairment than soluble Abeta and tau levels. To examine a putative role for alphaSyn in modulating cognitive function, we used the Barnes circular maze to assess spatial reference memory in transgenic mice overexpressing human wild-type alphaSyn. The results revealed that an approximate threefold elevation of alphaSyn in vivo induced memory deficits similar to those observed in AD mouse models. The neurobiological changes associated with this elevation of soluble alphaSyn included decreases in selected synaptic vesicle proteins and an alteration of the protein composition of synaptic vesicles. Finally, a synergism between Abeta/APP and human tau seems to be responsible for the abnormal elevation of soluble alphaSyn in transgenic mice. Altogether, our data reveal an unexpected role for soluble, intraneuronal alphaSyn in AD pathophysiology.

22841892|t|In vivo hippocampal microdialysis reveals impairment of NMDA receptor-cGMP signaling in APP(SW) and APP(SW)/PS1(L166P) Alzheimer's transgenic mice.
22841892|a|Transgenic (Tg) mice overexpressing human amyloid precursor protein (APP) mutants reproduce features of early Alzheimer's disease (AD) including memory deficit, presence of beta-amyloid (Abeta) oligomers, and age-associated formation of amyloid deposits. In this study we used hippocampal microdialysis to characterize the signaling of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors (NMDA-Rs) in awake and behaving AD Tg mice. The NMDA-R signaling is central to hippocampal synaptic plasticity underlying memory formation and several lines of evidence implicate the role of Abeta oligomers in effecting NMDA-R dysfunction. CA1 NMDA-Rs were stimulated by NMDA infused through reverse microdialysis while changes in the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) concentration in the brain interstitial fluid (ISF) were used to determine NMDA-Rs responsiveness. While 4 months old wild type C57BL/6 mice mounted robust cGMP response to the NMDA challenge, the same stimulus failed to significantly change the cGMP level in 4 and 15 months old APP(SW) and 4 months old APP(SW)/PS1(L166P) Tg mice, which were all on C57BL/6 background. Lack of response to NMDA in AD Tg mice occurred in the absence of changes in expression levels of several synaptic proteins including synaptophysin, NR1 NMDA-R subunit and postsynaptic density protein 95, which indicates lack of profound synaptic degeneration. Abeta oligomers were detected in all three AD Tg mice groups and their concentration in the hippocampus ranged from 40.5+-3.6ng/g in 4 months old APP(SW) mice to 60.8+-15.9ng/g in 4 months old APP(SW)/PS1(L166P) mice. Four months old APP(SW) mice had no Abeta amyloid plaques, while the other two AD Tg mice groups showed evidence of incipient Abeta amyloid plaque formation. Our studies describes a novel approach useful to study the function of NMDA-Rs in awake and behaving AD Tg mice and demonstrate impairment of NMDA-R response in the presence of endogenously formed Abeta oligomers but predating onset of Abeta amyloidosis.

22842466|t|Formation of spherulitic amyloid beta aggregate by anionic liposomes.
22842466|a|Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of senile dementia. This neurodegenerative disorder is characterized by an amyloid deposition in senile plaques, composed primarily of fibrils of an aggregated peptide, amyloid beta (Abeta). The modeling of a senile plaque formation on a model neuronal membrane under the physiological condition is an attractive issue. In this study, we used anionic liposomes to model the senile plaque formation by Abeta. The growth behavior of amyloid Abeta fibrils was directly observed, revealing that the induction of the spherulitic Abeta aggregates could result from the growth of seeds in the presence of anionic liposomes. The seeds of Abeta fibrils strongly interacted with negatively charged liposome and the subsequent association of the seeds were induced to form the seed cluster with many growth ends, which is advantageous for the formation of spherulitic Abeta aggregates. Therefore, anionic liposomes mediated not only fibril growth but also the aggregation process. These results imply that anionic liposome membranes would affect the aggregate form of Abeta fibrils. The modeling of senile plaque reported here is considered to have great potential for study on the amyloidosis.

22842730|t|L655,240, acting as a competitive BACE1 inhibitor, efficiently decreases beta-amyloid peptide production in HEK293-APPswe cells.
22842730|a|AIM: To identify a small molecule L655,240 as a novel beta-secretase (BACE1) inhibitor and to investigate its effects on beta-amyloid (Abeta) generation in vitro. METHODS: Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) was used to characterize the inhibitory effect of L655,240 on BACE1. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology-based assay was performed to study the binding affinity of L655,240 for BACE1. The selectivity of L655,240 toward BACE1 over other aspartic proteases was determined with enzymatic assay. The effects of L655,240 on Abeta40, Abeta42, and sAPPbeta production were studied in HEK293 cells stably expressing APP695 Swedish mutant(K595N/M596L) (HEK293-APPswe cells). The activities of BACE1, gamma-secretase and alpha-secretase were assayed, and both the mRNA and protein levels of APP and BACE1 were evaluated using real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: L655,240 was determined to be a competitive, selective BACE1 inhibitor (IC(50)=4.47+-1.37 mumol/L), which bound to BACE1 directly (K(D)=17.9+-0.72 mumol/L). L655,240 effectively reduced Abeta40, Abeta42, and sAPPbeta production by inhibiting BACE1 without affecting the activities of gamma-secretase and alpha-secretase in HEK293-APPswe cells. L655,240 has no effect on APP and BACE1 mRNA or protein levels in HEK293-APPswe cells. CONCLUSION: The small molecule L655,240 is a novel BACE1 inhibitor that can effectively decreases Abeta production in vitro, thereby highlighting its therapeutic potential for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

22846461|t|Expression and function of APP and its metabolites outside the central nervous system.
22846461|a|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) derived amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides have been extensively investigated in Alzheimer's disease pathology of the brain. However, the function of full length APP in the central nervous system remains unclear. Even less is known about the function of this ubiquitously expressed protein and its metabolites outside of the central nervous system. This review summarizes key aspects of the current understanding of the expression and function of APP and its proteolytic fragments in specific non-neuronal tissues.

22847417|t|Ubiquilin-1 regulates amyloid precursor protein maturation and degradation by stimulating K63-linked polyubiquitination of lysine 688.
22847417|a|The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to an amyloidogenic peptide termed Abeta. Although mutations in APP and the secretase enzymes that mediate its processing are known to result in familial forms of AD, the mechanisms underlying the more common sporadic forms of the disease are still unclear. Evidence suggests that the susceptibility of APP to amyloidogenic processing is related to its intracellular localization, and that secretase-independent degradation may prevent the formation of cytotoxic peptide fragments. Recently, single nucleotide polymorphisms in the UBQLN1 gene have been linked to late-onset AD, and its protein product, ubiquilin-1, may regulate the maturation of full-length APP. Here we show that ubiquilin-1 inhibits the maturation of APP by sequestering it in the early secretory pathway, primarily within the Golgi apparatus. This sequestration significantly delayed the proteolytic processing of APP by secretases and the proteasome. These effects were mediated by ubiquilin-1-stimulated K63-linked polyubiquitination of lysine 688 in the APP intracellular domain. Our results reveal the mechanistic basis by which ubiquilin-1 regulates APP maturation, with important consequences for the pathogenesis of late-onset AD.

22849569|t|Increased expression of the homologue of enhancer-of-split 1 protects neurons from beta amyloid neurotoxicity and hints at an alternative role for transforming growth factor beta1 as a neuroprotector.
22849569|a|INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in the brain, which produces progressive neuronal loss and dementia. We recently demonstrated that the noxious effects of Abeta on cultured hippocampal neurons are in part provoked by the antagonism of nerve growth factor (NGF) signalling, which impairs the activation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) by impeding the tyrosine phosphorylation of I-kappaBalpha. As a result, the expression of the homologue of Enhancer-of split 1 (Hes1) gene is downregulated and ultimately, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic connectivity is lost. METHODS: Hes1 activity was promoted in cultured hippocampal neurons by overexpressing a Hes1-encoding plasmid or by upregulating this gene by activating NF-kappaB through different approaches (overexpressing either the I-kappaB kinasebeta, or p65/RelA/NF-kappaB). Alternatively neurons were exposed to TGFbeta1. Dendrite patterning, GABAergic connectivity and cell survival were analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Hes1 expression was determined by real-time PCR. NF-kappaB activation was measured using the dual-luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS: The expression of Hes1 abolished the effects of Abeta on dendritic patterning and GABAergic input, and it prevented the death of the cultured neurons. TGFbeta1, a known neuroprotector, could counteract the deleterious effects of Abeta by inducing NF-kappaB activation following the serine phosphorylation of I-kappaBalpha. Indeed, the number of GABAergic terminals generated by inducing Hes1 expression was doubled. CONCLUSION: Our data define some of the mechanisms involved in Abeta-mediated cell death and they point to potential means to counteract this noxious activity.

22854022|t|SERF protein is a direct modifier of amyloid fiber assembly.
22854022|a|The inherent cytotoxicity of aberrantly folded protein aggregates contributes substantially to the pathogenesis of amyloid diseases. It was recently shown that a class of evolutionary conserved proteins, called MOAG-4/SERF, profoundly alter amyloid toxicity via an autonomous but yet unexplained mode. We show that the biological function of human SERF1a originates from its atypical ability to specifically distinguish between amyloid and nonamyloid aggregation. This inherently unstructured protein directly affected the aggregation kinetics of a broad range of amyloidogenic proteins in vitro, while being inactive against nonamyloid aggregation. A representative biophysical analysis of the SERF1a:alpha-synuclein (aSyn) complex revealed that the amyloid-promoting activity resulted from an early and transient interaction, which was sufficient to provoke a massive increase of soluble aSyn amyloid nucleation templates. Therefore, the autonomous amyloid-modifying activity of SERF1a observed in living organisms relies on a direct and dedicated manipulation of the early stages in the amyloid aggregation pathway.

22855810|t|A new concept: Abeta1-42 generates a hyperfunctional proteolytic NCX3 fragment that delays caspase-12 activation and neuronal death.
22855810|a|Although the amyloid-beta(1-42) (Abeta(1-42)) peptide involved in Alzheimer's disease is known to cause a dysregulation of intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis, its molecular mechanisms still remain unclear. We report that the extracellular-dependent early increase (30 min) in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)), following Abeta(1-42) exposure, caused the activation of calpain that in turn elicited a cleavage of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger isoform NCX3. This cleavage generated a hyperfunctional form of the antiporter and increased NCX currents (I(NCX)) in the reverse mode of operation. Interestingly, this NCX3 calpain-dependent cleavage was essential for the Abeta(1-42)-dependent I(NCX) increase. Indeed, the calpain inhibitor calpeptin and the removal of the calpain-cleavage recognition sequence, via site-directed mutagenesis, abolished this effect. Moreover, the enhanced NCX3 activity was paralleled by an increased Ca(2+) content in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores. Remarkably, the silencing in PC-12 cells or the knocking-out in mice of the ncx3 gene prevented the enhancement of both I(NCX) and Ca(2+) content in ER stores, suggesting that NCX3 was involved in the increase of ER Ca(2+) content stimulated by Abeta(1-42). By contrast, in the late phase (72 h), when the NCX3 proteolytic cleavage abruptly ceased, the occurrence of a parallel reduction in ER Ca(2+) content triggered ER stress, as revealed by caspase-12 activation. Concomitantly, the late increase in [Ca(2+)](i) coincided with neuronal death. Interestingly, NCX3 silencing caused an earlier activation of Abeta(1-42)-induced caspase-12. Indeed, in NCX3-silenced neurons, Abeta(1-42) exposure hastened caspase-dependent apoptosis, thus reinforcing neuronal cell death. These results suggest that Abeta(1-42), through Ca(2+)-dependent calpain activation, generates a hyperfunctional form of NCX3 that, by increasing Ca(2+) content into ER, delays caspase-12 activation and thus neuronal death.

22855816|t|Cross-linking of cell surface amyloid precursor protein leads to increased beta-amyloid peptide production in hippocampal neurons: implications for Alzheimer's disease.
22855816|a|The accumulation of the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is thought to play a causative role in triggering synaptic dysfunction in neurons, leading to their eventual demise through apoptosis. Abeta is produced and secreted upon sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-secretases and gamma-secretases. However, while Abeta levels have been shown to be increased in the brains of AD patients, little is known about how the cleavage of APP and the subsequent generation of Abeta is influenced, or whether the cleavage process changes over time. It has been proposed that Abeta can bind APP and promote amyloidogenic processing of APP, further enhancing Abeta production. Proof of this idea has remained elusive because a clear mechanism has not been identified, and the promiscuous nature of Abeta binding complicates the task of demonstrating the idea. To work around these problems, we used an antibody-mediated approach to bind and cross-link cell-surface APP in cultured rat primary hippocampal neurons. Here we show that cross-linking of APP is sufficient to raise the levels of Abeta in viable neurons with a concomitant increase in the levels of the beta-secretase BACE1. This appears to occur as a result of a sorting defect that stems from the caspase-3-mediated inactivation of a key sorting adaptor protein, namely GGA3, which prevents the lysosomal degradation of BACE1. Together, our data suggest the occurrence of a positive pathogenic feedback loop involving Abeta and APP in affected neurons possibly allowing Abeta to spread to nearby healthy neurons.

22855860|t|Plasma multianalyte profiling in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease.
22855860|a|OBJECTIVES: While plasma biomarkers have been proposed to aid in the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD), few biomarkers have been validated in independent patient cohorts. Here we aim to determine plasma biomarkers associated with AD in 2 independent cohorts and validate the findings in the multicenter Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). METHODS: Using a targeted proteomic approach, we measured levels of 190 plasma proteins and peptides in 600 participants from 2 independent centers (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia; Washington University, St. Louis, MO), and identified 17 analytes associated with the diagnosis of very mild dementia/mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD. Four analytes (apoE, B-type natriuretic peptide, C-reactive protein, pancreatic polypeptide) were also found to be altered in clinical MCI/AD in the ADNI cohort (n = 566). Regression analysis showed CSF Abeta42 levels and t-tau/Abeta42 ratios to correlate with the number of APOE4 alleles and plasma levels of B-type natriuretic peptide and pancreatic polypeptide. CONCLUSION: Four plasma analytes were consistently associated with the diagnosis of very mild dementia/MCI/AD in 3 independent clinical cohorts. These plasma biomarkers may predict underlying AD through their association with CSF AD biomarkers, and the association between plasma and CSF amyloid biomarkers needs to be confirmed in a prospective study.

22857904|t|Acceleration of deposition of Abeta(1-40) peptide on ultrasonically formed Abeta(1-42) nucleus studied by wireless quartz-crystal-microbalance biosensor.
22857904|a|High-frequency (~ 55 MHz) wireless quartz-crystal microbalance biosensor was used for studying heterogeneous deposition behavior of Abeta(1-40) peptide on Abeta(1-42) nuclei, which were grown under the stirring agitation and 200-kHz ultrasonication at pH 2.2, 4.6, and 7.4. The deposition reaction was monitored over 40 h, and the deposition rate was deduced. Among the agitation nuclei, the maximum deposition rate was observed on the nucleus grown at pH 4.6. However, ultrasonication nucleus grown at pH 7.4 produced much larger deposition rate, despite the same beta-sheet concentration. This result indicates that local structural modulation is caused in the nucleus by ultrasonication, which adsorbs the Abeta peptide more actively than other nuclei. The resultant deposits clearly show oligomeric structure.

22863679|t|F-spondin gene transfer improves memory performance and reduces amyloid-beta levels in mice.
22863679|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia affecting the elderly. Evidence has emerged signifying that stimulation of the reelin pathway should promote neural plasticity and suppress molecular changes associated with AD, suggesting a potential therapeutic application to the disease. This was explored through the use of lentiviral vector-mediated overexpression of the reelin homolog, F-spondin, which is an activator of the reelin pathway. Intrahippocampal gene transfer of F-spondin improved spatial learning/memory in the Morris Water Maze and increased exploration of the novel object in the Novel Object Recognition test in wild-type mice. F-spondin overexpression also suppressed endogenous levels of amyloid beta (Abeta(42)) in these mice and reduced Abeta plaque deposition while improving synaptophysin expression in transgenic mouse models of AD. These data demonstrate pathologic and cognitive improvements in mice through F-spondin overexpression.

22864813|t|Correspondence between in vivo (11)C-PiB-PET amyloid imaging and postmortem, region-matched assessment of plaques.
22864813|a|The definitive Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis requires postmortem confirmation of neuropathological hallmarks-amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). The advent of radiotracers for amyloid imaging presents an opportunity to investigate amyloid deposition in vivo. The (11)C-Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB)-PET ligand remains the most widely studied to date; however, regional variations in (11)C-PiB binding and the extent of agreement with neuropathological assessment have not been thoroughly investigated. Sojkova and colleagues [35] reported variable agreement between CERAD-based neuropathologic diagnosis of AD lesions and mean cortical PiB, suggesting the need for a more direct quantification of regional Abeta in relation to in vivo imaging. In the present study, we extend these findings by examining the correspondence among regional (11)C-PiB load, region-matched quantitative immunohistological assessments of Abeta and NFTs, and brain atrophy (MRI) in six older Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging participants who came to autopsy (imaging-autopsy interval range 0.2-2.4 years). The total number of Abeta plaques (6E10) and NFTs (PHF1) in paraffin sections from hippocampus, orbito-frontal cortex, anterior and posterior cingulate gyrus, precuneus and cerebellum was quantified using a technique guided by unbiased stereological principles. We report a general agreement between the regional measures of amyloid obtained via stereological assessment and imaging, with significant relationships evident for the anterior (r = 0.83; p = 0.04) and posterior (r = 0.94; p = 0.005) cingulate gyri, and the precuneus (r = 0.94; p = 0.005). No associations were observed between (11)C-PiB load and NFT count for any of the regions examined (p > 0.2 in all regions), or between regional Abeta or NFT counts and corresponding brain volumes. The strong associations of PiB retention with region-matched, quantitative analyses of Abeta in postmortem tissue offer support for the validity of (11)C-PiB-PET imaging as a method for evaluation of plaque burden in vivo.

22866977|t|Aminonaphthalene 2-cyanoacrylate (ANCA) probes fluorescently discriminate between amyloid-beta and prion plaques in brain.
22866977|a|A major challenge for diagnosing and monitoring the progression of amyloid-based diseases is the capability to distinguish between amyloid deposits that are associated with related, but distinctly different, diseases. Here, we demonstrate that aminonaphthalenyl 2-cyanoacrylate-based probes can fluorescently discriminate between different types of amyloid deposits in brain. The discriminating capability of these molecular rotors is due to the stabilization of the ground versus excited states of these probes as a function of the polarity of their microenvironment (i.e., within the binding pocket on the amyloid). This property makes it possible, for the first time, to estimate the inherent static relative permittivity (epsilon(0)) of the binding pocket of each amyloid within tissue. The capability to selectively follow the deposition of specific amyloids in tissue may provide important information for therapeutic development that is not readily accessible from currently available technology.

22869155|t|Comprehensive search for Alzheimer disease susceptibility loci in the APOE region.
22869155|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of risk and age at onset (AAO) of Alzheimer disease (AD) with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the chromosome 19 region including apolipoprotein E (APOE) and a repeat-length polymorphism in TOMM40 (poly-T, rs10524523). DESIGN: Conditional logistic regression models and survival analysis. SETTING: Fifteen genome-wide association study data sets assembled by the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium. PARTICIPANTS: Eleven thousand eight hundred forty AD cases and 10 931 cognitively normal elderly controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Association of AD risk and AAO with genotyped and imputed SNPs located in an 800-Mb region including APOE in the entire Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium data set and with the TOMM40 poly-T marker genotyped in a subset of 1256 cases and 1605 controls. RESULTS: In models adjusting for APOE epsilon4, no SNPs in the entire region were significantly associated with AAO at P.001. Rs10524523 was not significantly associated with AD or AAO in models adjusting for APOE genotype or within the subset of epsilon3/epsilon3 subjects. CONCLUSIONS: APOE alleles epsilon2, epsilon3, and epsilon4 account for essentially all the inherited risk of AD associated with this region. Other variants including a poly-T track in TOMM40 are not independent risk or AAO loci.

22869717|t|Postsynaptic dysfunction is associated with spatial and object recognition memory loss in a natural model of Alzheimer's disease.
22869717|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder associated with progressive memory loss, severe dementia, and hallmark neuropathological markers, such as deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides in senile plaques and accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins in neurofibrillary tangles. Recent evidence obtained from transgenic mouse models suggests that soluble, nonfibrillar Abeta oligomers may induce synaptic failure early in AD. Despite their undoubted value, these transgenic models rely on genetic manipulations that represent the inherited and familial, but not the most abundant, sporadic form of AD. A nontransgenic animal model that still develops hallmarks of AD would be an important step toward understanding how sporadic AD is initiated. Here we show that starting between 12 and 36 mo of age, the rodent Octodon degus naturally develops neuropathological signs of AD, such as accumulation of Abeta oligomers and phosphorylated tau proteins. Moreover, age-related changes in Abeta oligomers and tau phosphorylation levels are correlated with decreases in spatial and object recognition memory, postsynaptic function, and synaptic plasticity. These findings validate O. degus as a suitable natural model for studying how sporadic AD may be initiated.

22869937|t|Comparison of Cobra perilaryngeal airway (CobraPLA ) with flexible laryngeal mask airway in terms of device stability and ventilation characteristics in pediatric ophthalmic surgery.
22869937|a|BACKGROUND: Supraglottic airway devices play an important role in ophthalmic surgery. The flexible laryngeal mask airway (LMA ) is generally the preferred airway device. However, there are no studies comparing it with the Cobra perilaryngeal airway (CobraPLA ) in pediatric ophthalmic procedures. AIMS: To analyze the intraoperative device stability and ability to maintain normocarbia of CobraPLA  and compare it to that with flexible LMA . MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety children of American Society for Anesthesiologists physical status 1 and 2, aged 3-15 years scheduled for elective ophthalmic surgeries were randomly assigned to either the CobraPLA  or the flexible LMA  group. After placement of each airway device, oropharyngeal leak pressure (OLP) was noted. Adequate seal of the devices was confirmed at an inspired pressure of 15 cm H(2)O and pressure-controlled ventilation was initiated. Device displacement was diagnosed if there was a change in capnograph waveform, audible or palpable gas leak, change in expired tidal volume to <8 ml/kg, end-tidal carbon-dioxide persistently >6 kPa, or need to increase inspired pressure to >18 cm H(2)O to maintain normocarbia. RESULTS: Demographic data, duration, and type of surgery in both the groups were similar. A higher incidence of intraoperative device displacement was noted with the CobraPLA  in comparison to flexible LMA  (P < 0.001). Incidence of displacement was higher in strabismus surgery (7/12). Insertion characteristics and ventilation parameters were comparable. The OLP was significantly higher in CobraPLA  group (28 +- 6.8 cm H(2)O) compared to the flexible LMA  group (19.9 +- 4.5 cm H(2)O) (P < 0.001). Higher surgeon dissatisfaction (65.9%) was seen in the CobraPLA  group. CONCLUSION: The high incidence of device displacement and surgeon dissatisfaction make CobraPLA  a less favorable option than flexible LMA  in ophthalmic surgery.

22870885|t|Aggregation pathways of the amyloid beta(1-42) peptide depend on its colloidal stability and ordered beta-sheet stacking.
22870885|a|Amyloid beta (Abeta) fibrils are present as a major component in senile plaques, the hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Diffuse plaques (nonfibrous, loosely packed Abeta aggregates) containing amorphous Abeta aggregates are also formed in brain. This work examines the influence of Cu(2+) complexation by Abeta on the aggregation process in the context of charge and structural variations. Changes in the surface charges of Abeta molecules due to Cu(2+) binding, measured with a zeta-potential measurement device, were correlated with the aggregate morphologies examined by atomic force microscopy. As a result of the charge variation, the "colloid-like" stability of the aggregation intermediates, which is essential to the fibrillation process, is affected. Consequently, Cu(2+) enhances the amorphous aggregate formation. By monitoring variations in the secondary structures with circular dichroism spectroscopy, a direct transformation from the unstructured conformation to the beta-sheet structure was observed for all types of aggregates observed (oligomers, fibrils, and/or amorphous aggregates). Compared to the Abeta aggregation pathway in the absence of Cu(2+) and taking other factors affecting Abeta aggregation (i.e., pH and temperature) into account, our investigation indicates that formations of amorphous and fibrous aggregates diverge from the same beta-sheet-containing partially folded intermediate. This study suggests that the hydrophilic domain of Abeta also plays a role in the Abeta aggregation process. A kinetic model was proposed to account for the effects of the Cu(2+) binding on these two aggregation pathways in terms of charge and structural variations.

22877239|t|Curcumin binds to Abeta1-40 peptides and fibrils stronger than ibuprofen and naproxen.
22877239|a|Binding of curcumin, naproxen, and ibuprofen to Abeta1-40 peptide and its fibrils is studied by docking method and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. The Gromos96 43a1 force field and simple point charge model of water have been used for molecular dynamics simulations. It is shown that if the receptor is a monomer then naproxen and ibuprofen are bound to the same place that is different from the binding position of curcumin. However all of three ligands have the same binding pocket in fibrillar structures. The binding mechanism is studied in detail showing that the van der Waals interaction between ligand and receptor dominates over the electrostatic interaction. The binding free energies obtained by the molecular mechanic-Poisson-Boltzmann surface area method indicate that curcumin displays higher binding affinity than nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Our results are in good agreement with the experiments.

22879596|t|The metalloprotease meprin beta generates amino terminal-truncated amyloid beta peptide species.
22879596|a|The amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide, which is abundantly found in the brains of patients suffering from Alzheimer disease, is central in the pathogenesis of this disease. Therefore, to understand the processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is of critical importance. Recently, we demonstrated that the metalloprotease meprin beta cleaves APP and liberates soluble N-terminal APP (N-APP) fragments. In this work, we present evidence that meprin beta can also process APP in a manner reminiscent of beta-secretase. We identified cleavage sites of meprin beta in the amyloid beta sequence of the wild type and Swedish mutant of APP at positions p1 and p2, thereby generating Abeta variants starting at the first or second amino acid residue. We observed even higher kinetic values for meprin beta than BACE1 for both the wild type and the Swedish mutant APP form. This enzymatic activity of meprin beta on APP and Abeta generation was also observed in the absence of BACE1/2 activity using a beta-secretase inhibitor and BACE knock-out cells, indicating that meprin beta acts independently of beta-secretase.

22879628|t|The amyloid precursor protein (APP) family members are key players in S-adenosylmethionine formation by MAT2A and modify BACE1 and PSEN1 gene expression-relevance for Alzheimer's disease.
22879628|a|Central hallmark of Alzheimer's disease are senile plaques mainly composed of beta-amyloid, which is a cleavage product of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). The physiological function of APP and its family members APLP1 and APLP2 is poorly understood. In order to fill this gap, we established a cell-culture based model with simultaneous knockdown of all members of the family. A comprehensive proteome study of the APP/APLP1/APLP2 knockdown cell lysates versus controls revealed significant protein abundance changes of more than 30 proteins. Targeted validation of selected candidates by immunoblotting supported the significant down-regulation of the methionine adenosyltransferase II, alpha (MAT2A) as well as of peroxiredoxin 4 in the knockdown cells. Moreover, MAT2A was significantly down-regulated at the mRNA level as well. MAT2A catalyzes the production of S-adenosylmethionine from methionine and ATP, which plays a pivotal role in the methylation of neurotransmitters, DNA, proteins, and lipids. MAT2A-dependent significant up-regulation of S-adenosylmethionine was also detectable in the knockdown cells compared with controls. Our results point to a role of the APP family proteins in cellular methylation mechanisms and fit to findings of disturbed S-adenosylmethionine levels in tissue and CSF of Alzheimer disease patients versus controls. Importantly, methylation plays a central role for neurotransmitter generation like acetylcholine pointing to a crucial relevance of our findings for Alzheimer's disease. In addition, we identified differential gene expression of BACE1 and PSEN1 in the knockdown cells, which is possibly a consequence of MAT2A deregulation and may indicate a self regulatory mechanism.

22883210|t|Selective loss of noradrenaline exacerbates early cognitive dysfunction and synaptic deficits in APP/PS1 mice.
22883210|a|BACKGROUND: Degeneration of the locus coeruleus (LC), the major noradrenergic nucleus in the brain, occurs early and is ubiquitous in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Experimental lesions to the LC exacerbate AD-like neuropathology and cognitive deficits in several transgenic mouse models of AD. Because the LC contains multiple neuromodulators known to affect amyloid beta toxicity and cognitive function, the specific role of noradrenaline (NA) in AD is not well understood. METHODS: To determine the consequences of selective NA deficiency in an AD mouse model, we crossed dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) knockout mice with amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin-1 (PS1) mice overexpressing mutant APP and PS1. Dopamine beta-hydroxylase (-/-) mice are unable to synthesize NA but otherwise have normal LC neurons and co-transmitters. Spatial memory, hippocampal long-term potentiation, and synaptic protein levels were assessed. RESULTS: The modest impairments in spatial memory and hippocampal long-term potentiation displayed by young APP/PS1 or DBH (-/-) single mutant mice were augmented in DBH (-/-)/APP/PS1 double mutant mice. Deficits were associated with reduced levels of total calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 2A and increased N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 2B levels and were independent of amyloid beta accumulation. Spatial memory performance was partly improved by treatment with the NA precursor drug L-threo-dihydroxyphenylserine. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that early LC degeneration and subsequent NA deficiency in AD may contribute to cognitive deficits via altered levels of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and suggest that NA supplementation could be beneficial in early AD.

22884903|t|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) regulates synaptic structure and function.
22884903|a|The amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays a critical role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. APP is proteolytically cleaved by beta- and gamma-secretases to generate the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta), the core protein component of senile plaques in AD. It is also cleaved by alpha-secretase to release the large soluble APP (sAPP) luminal domain that has been shown to exhibit trophic properties. Increasing evidence points to the development of synaptic deficits and dendritic spine loss prior to deposition of amyloid in transgenic mouse models that overexpress APP and Abeta peptides. The consequence of loss of APP, however, is unsettled. In this study, we investigated whether APP itself plays a role in regulating synaptic structure and function using an APP knock-out (APP-/-) mouse model. We examined dendritic spines in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons and CA1 neurons of hippocampus from APP-/- mice. In the cultured neurons, there was a significant decrease (~35%) in spine density in neurons derived from APP-/- mice compared to littermate control neurons that were partially restored with sAPPalpha-conditioned medium. In APP-/- mice in vivo, spine numbers were also significantly reduced but by a smaller magnitude (~15%). Furthermore, apical dendritic length and dendritic arborization were markedly diminished in hippocampal neurons. These abnormalities in neuronal morphology were accompanied by reduction in long-term potentiation. Strikingly, all these changes in vivo were only seen in mice that were 12-15 months in age but not in younger animals. We propose that APP, specifically sAPP, is necessary for the maintenance of dendritic integrity in the hippocampus in an age-associated manner. Finally, these age-related changes may contribute to AD pathology independent of Abeta-mediated synaptic toxicity.

22885025|t|Kinetic intermediates of amyloid fibrillation studied by hydrogen exchange methods with nuclear magnetic resonance.
22885025|a|Amyloid fibrils with an ordered cross-beta structure are one form of protein aberrant aggregates. Fibrils themselves and on-pathway small aggregates are involved in many neurodegenerative diseases and amylodoses. Over the past decade, much has been learned about the conformation of amyloid fibrils by using various biochemical and biophysical approaches. Amyloid fibrils accommodate rigid core structures composed of regular intra- and intermolecular non-covalent bonds such as hydrogen bonds, and disordered flexible regions exposed to solvents. In contrast to the improved understanding of fibril structures, few studies have investigated the short-living monomeric intermediates which interact with amyloid fibrils for elongation and the self-associated intermediates in the course of amyloidogenesis at the residue level. To study static fibrillar structures and kinetic intermediates, hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HD(ex)) coupled with solution-state NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful methods with a high time and atomic resolution. Here, we review studies on the structural properties of amyloid fibrils based on a combination of dimethylsulfoxide-quenched HD(ex) and NMR spectroscopy. Recent studies on transient kinetic intermediates during fibril growth by means of pulse-labeling HD(ex) aided by a quenched-flow apparatus and NMR spectroscopy are focused on.

22888831|t|Immunoassays with protein misfolding cycle amplification: a platform for ultrasensitive detection of antigen.
22888831|a|Protein misfolding cycle amplification (PMCA), a novel technology on amplifying cyclically misfolded proteins in vitro, is conceptually analogous to DNA amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and has tremendous implications for the researches and diagnosis. Here we first introduce the protein amplification technology into the classic immunoassay and develop a PMCA-based immunoassay (immuno-PMCA) for highly sensitive detection of antigen. This method takes advantage of sandwich binding of two affinity aptamers for increased specificity, magnetic nanoparticles for fast magnetic separation, PMCA for signal amplification, and conjugated polyelectrolytes for visual detection, allowing the detection limit of antigen by colorimetry down to femtomolar level with a wide linear range from 10 to 10(4) fM. More importantly, no specialized facilities or enzymes are needed either in the amplification reaction or the evaluation of results, which indicates its great potential application in immunological research and clinical diagnostics.

22889139|t|Primary phagocytosis of viable neurons by microglia activated with LPS or Abeta is dependent on calreticulin/LRP phagocytic signalling.
22889139|a|BACKGROUND: Microglia are resident brain macrophages that can phagocytose dead, dying or viable neurons, which may be beneficial or detrimental in inflammatory, ischaemic and neurodegenerative brain pathologies. Cell death caused by phagocytosis of an otherwise viable cell is called 'primary phagocytosis' or 'phagoptosis'. Calreticulin (CRT) exposure on the surface of cancer cells can promote their phagocytosis via LRP (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein) on macrophages, but it is not known whether this occurs with neurons and microglia. METHODS: We used primary cultures of cerebellar neurons, astrocytes and microglia to investigate the potential role of CRT/LRP phagocytic signalling in the phagocytosis of viable neurons by microglia stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or nanomolar concentrations of amyloid-beta peptide1-42 (Abeta). Exposure of CRT on the neuronal surface was investigated using surface biotinylation and western blotting. A phagocytosis assay was also developed using BV2 and PC12 cell lines to investigate CRT/LRP signalling in microglial phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. RESULTS: We found that BV2 microglia readily phagocytosed apoptotic PC12 cells, but this was inhibited by a CRT-blocking antibody or LRP-blocking protein (receptor-associated protein: RAP). Activation of primary rat microglia with LPS or Abeta resulted in loss of co-cultured cerebellar granule neurons, and this was blocked by RAP or antibodies against CRT or against LRP, preventing all neuronal loss and death. CRT was present on the surface of viable neurons, and this exposure did not change in inflammatory conditions. CRT antibodies prevented microglia-induced neuronal loss when added to neurons, while LRP antibodies prevented neuronal loss when added to the microglia. Pre-binding of CRT to neurons promoted neuronal loss if activated microglia were added, but pre-binding of CRT to microglia or both cell types prevented microglia-induced neuronal loss. CONCLUSIONS: CRT exposure on the surface of viable or apoptotic neurons appears to be required for their phagocytosis via LRP receptors on activated microglia, but free CRT can block microglial phagocytosis of neurons by acting on microglia. Phagocytosis of CRT-exposing neurons by microglia can be a direct cause of neuronal death during inflammation, and might therefore contribute to neurodegeneration and be prevented by blocking the CRT/LRP pathway.

22889671|t|Effects of Abeta1-42 on the current of KATP channels in cultured cholinergic neurons.
22889671|a|OBJECTIVE: This study mainly determined the effect of beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta(1-42)) on the ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels of the cultured cortical and hippocampal cholinergic neurons, and further confirmed the protective effect of Diazoxide,  which was the specific opener of K(ATP) channels, to the neurons. METHODS: The primary rat cortical and hippocampal cholinergic neurons were cultured. Membrane currents were measured using whole-cell patch-clamp technique. RESULTS: The data showed that the outward  current of neurons significantly decreased after using Abeta(1-42) (P<0 05), and that the outward current of decreased did not change after given Diazoxide again (P>0 05) compared with control. However, after being pretreated with Diazoxide  for 1 hour before using Abeta(1-42), this phenomenon did not exist; that is, the membrane current of the neurons did not change when we give Abeta(1-42) after pretreatment with Diazoxide (P>0 05). CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that  Abeta(1-42) inhibits the openings of the K(ATP) channels, while this inhibitory action can be removed by pretreatment with Diazoxide. It is indicated that the opening of K(ATP) channels may play a potential neuroprotective role in antineurotoxicity of Abeta(1-42),  and the application of Diazoxide in small dose may be helpful in the treatment of Abeta(1-42) neurotoxicity.

22889768|t|Oral glucose loading modulates plasma beta-amyloid level in alzheimer's disease patients: potential diagnostic method for Alzheimer's disease.
22889768|a|BACKGROUND: Although plasma beta-amyloid (Abeta) has been suggested to be a noninvasive diagnostic biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD), its significance and validity have been inconclusive. Thus, it is quite important to establish a novel diagnostic method related to plasma Abeta. METHODS: As our previous animal studies demonstrated a relation of glucose with plasma Abeta, we examined the effect of glucose loading on plasma Abeta levels in AD patients. After fasting, an oral glucose load was administered to AD patients and non-AD dementia patients, and subsequently, blood glucose, plasma insulin, and plasma Abeta levels were measured. RESULTS: The plasma levels of baseline blood glucose, plasma insulin, and plasma Abeta were not different between the two groups. However, immediately after glucose loading, a significant increase in plasma Abeta40 and Abeta42 levels was observed in AD patients, whereas a mild decrease in plasma Abeta40 and Abeta42 levels was detected in non-AD dementia patients. CONCLUSION: The present study clearly demonstrated a different response in plasma Abeta40 and Abeta42 levels after glucose loading between AD and non-AD dementia patients, which is consistent with our previous animal studies. These findings suggest a novel diagnostic tool for AD using the elevation of plasma Abeta level after glucose loading, although further studies are necessary.

22889922|t|Physical activity and amyloid-beta plasma and brain levels: results from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Study of Ageing.
22889922|a|Previous studies suggest physical activity improves cognition and lowers Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. However, key AD pathogenic factors that are thought to be influenced by physical activity, particularly plasma amyloid-beta (Abeta) and Abeta brain load, have yet to be thoroughly investigated. The objective of this study was to determine if plasma Abeta and amyloid brain deposition are associated with physical activity levels, and whether these associations differed between carriers and non-carriers of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele. Five-hundred and forty six cognitively intact participants (aged 60-95 years) from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Study of Ageing (AIBL) were included in these analyses. Habitual physical activity levels were measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Serum insulin, glucose, cholesterol and plasma Abeta levels were measured in fasting blood samples. A subgroup (n=116) underwent (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET) scanning to quantify brain amyloid load. Higher levels of physical activity were associated with higher high density lipoprotein (HDL) (P=0.037), and lower insulin (P<0.001), triglycerides (P=0.019) and Abeta1-42/1-40 ratio (P=0.001). After stratification of the cohort based on APOE epsilon4 allele carriage, it was evident that only non-carriers received the benefit of reduced plasma Abeta from physical activity. Conversely, lower levels of PiB SUVR (standardised uptake value ratio) were observed in higher exercising APOE epsilon4 carriers. Lower plasma Abeta1-42/1-40 and brain amyloid was observed in those reporting higher levels of physical activity, consistent with the hypothesis that physical activity may be involved in the modulation of pathogenic changes associated with AD.

22890420|t|Stimulation of the retinoid X receptor facilitates beta-amyloid clearance across the blood-brain barrier.
22890420|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative process characterized, in part, by the accumulation of beta-amyloid proteins (Abeta) in the brain. Evidence now suggests that the excessive Abeta accumulation is the result of impaired clearance from the brain. Recent studies have indicated that retinoid X receptor (RXR) activation stimulates the metabolic clearance of Abeta and rapidly reverses Abeta-induced behavioral deficits, doing so in an apoE-dependent manner. Previously, we reported that soluble apoE (i.e., not bound to Abeta) facilitated Abeta transit across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). As Abeta clearance from the brain involves both metabolic and BBB-mediated processes, the current studies investigated the impact of RXR stimulation on Abeta clearance across the BBB. Treatment with RXR agonists increased Abeta clearance across the BBB both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, this processes appeared to involve apoE as RXR agonism did not stimulate Abeta BBB clearance when apoE was absent. Thus, RXR activation could mitigate Abeta brain burden by promoting both the metabolic and BBB clearance of Abeta, offering a novel approach to the treatment of AD.

22891241|t|Ezrin/radixin/moesin are required for the purinergic P2X7 receptor (P2X7R)-dependent processing of the amyloid precursor protein.
22891241|a|The amyloid precursor protein (APP) can be cleaved by alpha-secretases in neural cells to produce the soluble APP ectodomain (sAPPalpha), which is neuroprotective. We have shown previously that activation of the purinergic P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) triggers sAPPalpha shedding from neural cells. Here, we demonstrate that the activation of ezrin, radixin, and moesin (ERM) proteins is required for the P2X7R-dependent proteolytic processing of APP leading to sAPPalpha release. Indeed, the down-regulation of ERM by siRNA blocked the P2X7R-dependent shedding of sAPPalpha. We also show that P2X7R stimulation triggered the phosphorylation of ERM. Thus, ezrin translocates to the plasma membrane to interact with P2X7R. Using specific pharmacological inhibitors, we established the order in which several enzymes trigger the P2X7R-dependent release of sAPPalpha. Thus, a Rho kinase and the MAPK modules ERK1/2 and JNK act upstream of ERM, whereas a PI3K activity is triggered downstream. For the first time, this work identifies ERM as major partners in the regulated non-amyloidogenic processing of APP.

22891244|t|The endocannabinoid, anandamide, augments Notch-1 signaling in cultured cortical neurons exposed to amyloid-beta and in the cortex of aged rats.
22891244|a|Aberrant Notch signaling has recently emerged as a possible mechanism for the altered neurogenesis, cognitive impairment, and learning and memory deficits associated with Alzheimer disease (AD). Recently, targeting the endocannabinoid system in models of AD has emerged as a potential approach to slow the progression of the disease process. Although studies have identified neuroprotective roles for endocannabinoids, there is a paucity of information on modulation of the pro-survival Notch pathway by endocannabinoids. In this study the influence of the endocannabinoids, anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol, on the Notch-1 pathway and on its endogenous regulators were investigated in an in vitro model of AD. We report that AEA up-regulates Notch-1 signaling in cultured neurons. We also provide evidence that although Abeta(1-42) increases expression of the endogenous inhibitor of Notch-1, numb (Nb), this can be prevented by AEA and 2-arachidonoylglycerol. Interestingly, AEA up-regulated Nct expression, a component of gamma-secretase, and this was found to play a crucial role in the enhanced Notch-1 signaling mediated by AEA. The stimulatory effects of AEA on Notch-1 signaling persisted in the presence of Abeta(1-42). AEA was found to induce a preferential processing of Notch-1 over amyloid precursor protein to generate Abeta(1-40). Aging, a natural process of neurodegeneration, was associated with a reduction in Notch-1 signaling in rat cortex and hippocampus, and this was restored with chronic treatment with URB 597. In summary, AEA has the proclivity to enhance Notch-1 signaling in an in vitro model of AD, which may have relevance for restoring neurogenesis and cognition in AD.

22891248|t|Discovery and structure activity relationship of small molecule inhibitors of toxic beta-amyloid-42 fibril formation.
22891248|a|Increasing evidence implicates Abeta peptides self-assembly and fibril formation as crucial events in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. Thus, inhibiting Abeta aggregation, among others, has emerged as a potential therapeutic intervention for this disorder. Herein, we employed 3-aminopyrazole as a key fragment in our design of non-dye compounds capable of interacting with Abeta42 via a donor-acceptor-donor hydrogen bond pattern complementary to that of the beta-sheet conformation of Abeta42. The initial design of the compounds was based on connecting two 3-aminopyrazole moieties via a linker to identify suitable scaffold molecules. Additional aryl substitutions on the two 3-aminopyrazole moieties were also explored to enhance pi-pi stacking/hydrophobic interactions with amino acids of Abeta42. The efficacy of these compounds on inhibiting Abeta fibril formation and toxicity in vitro was assessed using a combination of biophysical techniques and viability assays. Using structure activity relationship data from the in vitro assays, we identified compounds capable of preventing pathological self-assembly of Abeta42 leading to decreased cell toxicity.

22892246|t|Sustained levels of antibodies against Abeta in amyloid-rich regions of the CNS following intravenous dosing in human APP transgenic mice.
22892246|a|Passive immunization with anti-Abeta antibodies leads to the reduction of AD-like neuropathology in transgenic mice. Previously we showed that anti-Abeta antibodies enter the brain and bind to amyloid plaques. Now using (125)I-labeled 3D6, the mouse parent antibody of the clinical candidate bapineuzumab, we further characterized the pharmacokinetic profile of this antibody in the brain and serum. Our studies demonstrated that following a single intravenous injection, the labeled antibody accumulates and persists in plaque rich regions of the brain in transgenic PDAPP mice. Accumulation was specific to amyloid since it did not occur in non-transgenic animals lacking human APP, could not be measured in transgenic animals prior to plaque deposition, and correlated with the level of plaque burden in aging transgenic mice. After a single intravenous injection, CNS levels of (125)I-labeled 3D6 continued to increase for 14 days even as serum levels of the antibody declined. The calculated half-life of antibody in the circulation was 6 days, while antibody levels in the CNS remained stable for nearly a month. When given at supra-therapeutic levels, unlabeled antibody did not compete with tracer levels of labeled antibody for accumulation in the CNS, indicating that the binding capacity of plaques was very high. Our results demonstrate that even when administered in the periphery at very low (tracer) doses, 3D6 and bapineuzumab cross the blood brain barrier to accumulate in plaque rich regions of the brain. CNS clearance is markedly slower than in the serum and correlates with binding to deposited amyloid in a transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease.

22892585|t|Safety and tolerability of the gamma-secretase inhibitor avagacestat in a phase 2 study of mild to moderate Alzheimer disease.
22892585|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of the -secretase inhibitor avagacestat in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease (AD). DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,24-week phase 2 study. SETTING: Global, multicenter trial. PATIENTS: A total of 209 outpatients with mild to moderate AD were randomized into the double-blind treatment phase. The median age of the patients was 75 years,58.9% were APOE epsilon4 carriers, and baseline measures of disease severity were similar among groups. INTERVENTION: Avagacestat, 25, 50, 100, or 125 mg daily,or placebo administered orally daily. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Safety and tolerability of avagacestat. RESULTS: Discontinuation rates for the 25-mg and 50-mg doses of avagacestat were comparable with placebo but were higher in the 100-mg and 125-mg dose groups.Trends for worsening cognition, as measured by change from baseline Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale score, were observed in the 100-mg and125-mg dose groups. Treatment-emergent serious adverse events were similar across placebo and treatment groups. The most common reason for discontinuation was adverse events, predominantly gastrointestinal anddermatologic. Other adverse events occurring more frequentlyin patients undergoing treatment included reversibleglycosuria (without associated serum glucose changes), nonmelanoma skin cancer, and asymptomaticmagnetic resonance imaging findings. Exploratory cerebrospinal fluid amyloid isoforms and tau biomarker analysis demonstrated dose-dependent but not statistically significant reductions in a small subset of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Avagacestat dosed at 25 and 50 mg daily was relatively well tolerated and had low discontinuation rates. The 100-mg and 125-mg dose arms were poorly tolerated with trends for cognitive worsening. Exploratory cerebrospinal fluid biomarker substudies provide preliminary support for -secretase target engagement,but additional studies are warranted to better characterize pharmacodynamic effects at the 25- and 50-mg doses.This study establishes an acceptable safety and tolerability dose range for future avagacestat studies in AD.

22892904|t|Microvascular cerebral blood volume changes in aging APP(swe)/PS1(dE9) AD mouse model: a voxel-wise approach.
22892904|a|Vascular disorders can either be cause or consequence in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To comprehensively characterize the occurrence of vascular impairment in a double transgenic mouse model for AD (APPswe/PS1dE9) during aging, we developed a new method to obtain microvascular relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV(micro)) maps from gradient echo MR imaging by histogram evaluation and we applied a voxel-wise approach to detect rCBV(micro) changes. With this methodology the development of cerebral microvascular impairments can be described in vivo with 0.16 mm isotropic resolution for the whole mouse brain. At 8 months, impaired rCBV(micro) appeared in some cortical regions and in the thalamus, which spreads over several sub-cortical areas and the hippocampus at 13 months. With a ROI-based approach, we further showed that hippocampal rCBV(micro) in 13-month-old wild-type and APP(swe)/PS1(dE9) mice correlates well with capillary density measured with immunohistochemical staining. However, no differences in capillary density were detected between genotypes. The rCBV(micro) values showed no significant correlation with amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaque deposition, Abeta at blood vessel walls and biochemically measured levels of Abeta1-40, Abeta1-42 oligomers and fibrillar forms. These results suggest that rCBV(micro) reduction is caused by an impaired vasoactivity of capillaries and arterioles, which is not directly correlated with the amount of Abeta deposition in parenchyma nor blood vessel walls.

22893221|t|Comparison of volumetric capnography and mixed expired gas methods to calculate physiological dead space in mechanically ventilated ICU patients.
22893221|a|INTRODUCTION: Physiological dead space should be a routine measurement in ventilated patients but measuring dead space using the Douglas bag (DB) method is cumbersome and requires corrections for compressed ventilator gas. These factors make this method impractical in the critical care setting. Volumetric capnography (VCAP) offers a relatively simple solution to calculating dead space. Few studies have been conducted to directly compare dead space measured by VCAP and the DB method in critically unwell adults. METHOD: Prospective observational study of 48 mechanically ventilated adults ICU patients. Dead space was calculated simultaneously using VCAP (CO(2)SMO) and the Bohr-Enghoff equation. In total, 168 paired readings were taken. Single-breath CO(2) waveform areas under the curve were computed automatically by software to calculate physiological dead space. The calculated value of P(E(CO(2))) was also recorded from the CO(2)SMO device. Exhaust ventilator gas was collected in a 10-l mixing chamber. P(E(CO(2))) was measured in the chamber following correction for compressed gas. RESULTS: The study demonstrated good agreement between physiological V(D)/V(T) calculated by VCAP and corrected (mean bias 0.03), and uncorrected (mean bias 0.02) Bohr-Enghoff method. There was good correlation between the two methods of measurement (VCAP vs corrected r(2) = 0.90 P < 0.001, VCAP vs uncorrected r(2) = 0.90, P < 0.001). There was good correlation between [Formula: see text] calculated by the CO(2)SMO and in the exhaust collected gas (mean bias 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: VCAP shows good agreement with Douglas Bag method in measuring physiological V(D)/V(T) over a wide range of dead space fractions.

22895708|t|Interaction between amyloid-beta pathology and cortical functional columnar organization.
22895708|a|Amyloid-beta plaques are one of the major neuropathological features in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Plaques are found in the extracellular space of telencephalic structures, and have been shown to disrupt neuronal connectivity. Since the disruption of connectivity may underlie a number of the symptoms of AD, understanding the distribution of plaques in the neuropil in relation to the connectivity pattern of the neuronal network is crucial. We measured the distribution and clustering patterns of plaques in the vibrissae-receptive primary sensory cortex (barrel cortex), in which the cortical columnar structure is anatomically demarcated by boundaries in Layer IV. We found that the plaques are not distributed randomly with respect to the barrel structures in Layer IV; rather, they are more concentrated in the septal areas than in the barrels. This difference was not preserved in the supragranular extensions of the functional columns. When comparing the degree of clustering of plaques between primary sensory cortices, we found that the degree of plaques clustering is significantly higher in somatosensory cortex than in visual cortex, and these differences are preserved in Layers II/III. The degree of areal discontinuity is therefore correlated with the patterns of neuropathological deposits. The discontinuous anatomical structure of this area allows us to make predictions about the functional effects of plaques on specific patterns of computational disruption in the AD brain.

22895721|t|Alzheimer's beta-secretase (BACE1) regulates the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway independently of beta-amyloid.
22895721|a|beta-Amyloid protein (Abeta), the major component of neuritic plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD), is derived from proteolytic cleavages of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and the gamma-secretase complex. BACE1 is the rate-limiting enzyme for Abeta production, and an increase in BACE1 level/activity contributes to the pathogenesis of sporadic AD. In addition to cleaving APP for Abeta generation, BACE1 plays multiple physiological roles including the regulation of synaptic functions. Here, we found that overexpression of BACE1 reduces cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation, protein kinase A (PKA) activity, and cAMP levels, whereas downregulation of BACE1 has the opposite effect. We showed that BACE1's effect is independent of its activity for Abeta production, which is corroborated by the observation that BACE1 transgenic mice have impaired learning/memory in the absence of neurotoxic human Abeta. Furthermore, we demonstrated that BACE1 interacts via its transmembrane domain with adenylate cyclase, resulting in reduction of cellular cAMP levels and thus PKA inactivation and reduced CREB phosphorylation. Our study suggests that in addition to its function as the beta-secretase to produce Abeta, BACE1 may contribute to the memory and cognitive deficits typical of AD by regulating the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway, which is important for memory functions.

22895829|t|Insulin-like growth factor-1 protects against prion peptide-induced             cell death in neuronal cells via inhibition of Bax translocation.
22895829|a|Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is one of the most important components             of bovine colostrum. It exhibits antiapoptotic and antioxidative activities. Prion             diseases are neurodegenerative disorders caused by cell death through mitochondrial             dysfunction and increasing generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This study             examined the protective effect of IGF-1 on residues 106-126 of the cellular prion             protein [PrP (106-126)]-mediated mitochondrial neurotoxicity and oxidative stress.             In SH-SY5Y human neuronal cells, treatment with PrP (106-126) decreased the cell             viability and IGF-1 pretreatment markedly blocked the PrP (106-126)-induced neuronal             cell death. IGF-1 inhibited PrP (106-126)-induced intracellular ROS generation             and mitochondrial oxidative stress. In addition, IGF-1 blocked the translocation             of the Bax protein to the mitochondria induced by PrP (106-126). These results             demonstrate that IGF-1 protects neuronal cells against PrP (106-126)-mediated             neurotoxicity through an antioxidative effect and blockage of mitochondrial Bax             translocation. The results also suggest that regulation of IGF-1 secretion may             have a therapeutic potential in the management of mitochondrial dysfunction and             oxidative stress-induced neurodegeneration.

22896675|t|A paravascular pathway facilitates CSF flow through the brain parenchyma and the clearance of interstitial solutes, including amyloid beta.
22896675|a|Because it lacks a lymphatic circulation, the brain must clear extracellular proteins by an alternative mechanism. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) functions as a sink for brain extracellular solutes, but it is not clear how solutes from the brain interstitium move from the parenchyma to the CSF. We demonstrate that a substantial portion of subarachnoid CSF cycles through the brain interstitial space. On the basis of in vivo two-photon imaging of small fluorescent tracers, we showed that CSF enters the parenchyma along paravascular spaces that surround penetrating arteries and that brain interstitial fluid is cleared along paravenous drainage pathways. Animals lacking the water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4) in astrocytes exhibit slowed CSF influx through this system and a ~70% reduction in interstitial solute clearance, suggesting that the bulk fluid flow between these anatomical influx and efflux routes is supported by astrocytic water transport. Fluorescent-tagged amyloid beta, a peptide thought to be pathogenic in Alzheimer's disease, was transported along this route, and deletion of the Aqp4 gene suppressed the clearance of soluble amyloid beta, suggesting that this pathway may remove amyloid beta from the central nervous system. Clearance through paravenous flow may also regulate extracellular levels of proteins involved with neurodegenerative conditions, its impairment perhaps contributing to the mis-accumulation of soluble proteins.

22897679|t|Engineered polymer nanoparticles containing hydrophobic dipeptide for inhibition of amyloid-beta fibrillation.
22897679|a|Protein aggregation into amyloid fibrils is implicated in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases. Engineered nanoparticles have emerged as a potential approach to alter the kinetics of protein fibrillation process. Yet, there are only a few reports describing the use of nanoparticles for inhibition of amyloid-beta 40 (Abeta(40)) peptide aggregation, involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, we designed new uniform biocompatible amino-acid-based polymer nanoparticles containing hydrophobic dipeptides in the polymer side chains. The dipeptide residues were designed similarly to the hydrophobic core sequence of Abeta. Poly(N-acryloyl-L-phenylalanyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester) (polyA-FF-ME) nanoparticles of 57 +- 6 nm were synthesized by dispersion polymerization of the monomer A-FF-ME in 2-methoxy ethanol, followed by precipitation of the obtained polymer in aqueous solution. Cell viability assay confirmed that no significant cytotoxic effect of the polyA-FF-ME nanoparticles on different human cell lines, e.g., PC-12 and SH-SY5Y, was observed. A significantly slow secondary structure transition from random coil to beta-sheets during Abeta(40) fibril formation was observed in the presence of these nanoparticles, resulting in significant inhibition of Abeta(40) fibrillation kinetics. However, the polyA-FF-ME analogous nanoparticles containing the L-alanyl-L-alanine (AA) dipeptide in the polymer side groups, polyA-AA-ME nanoparticles, accelerate the Abeta(40) fibrillation kinetics. The polyA-FF-ME nanoparticles and the polyA-AA-ME nanoparticles may therefore contribute to a mechanistic understanding of the fibrillation process, leading to the development of therapeutic strategies against amyloid-related diseases.

22898621|t|Hydrogen sulfide attenuates spatial memory impairment and hippocampal neuroinflammation in beta-amyloid rat model of Alzheimer's disease.
22898621|a|BACKGROUND: Endogenously produced hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) may have multiple functions in brain. An increasing number of studies have demonstrated its anti-inflammatory effects. In the present study, we investigated the effect of sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS, a H(2)S donor) on cognitive impairment and neuroinflammatory changes induced by injections of Amyloid-beta(1-40) (Abeta(1-40)), and explored possible mechanisms of action. METHODS: We injected Abeta(1-40) into the hippocampus of rats to mimic rat model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Morris water maze was used to detect the cognitive function. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed to detect neuronal apoptosis. Immunohistochemistry analyzed the response of glia. The expression of interleukin (IL)-1beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The expression of Abeta(1-40), phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phospho-p65 Nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, and phospho-c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) was analyzed by western blot. RESULTS: We demonstrated that pretreatment with NaHS ameliorated learning and memory deficits in an Abeta(1-40) rat model of AD. NaHS treatment suppressed Abeta(1-40)-induced apoptosis in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus. Moreover, the over-expression in IL-1beta and TNF-alpha as well as the extensive astrogliosis and microgliosis in the hippocampus induced by Abeta(1-40) were significantly reduced following administration of NaHS. Concomitantly, treatment with NaHS alleviated the levels of p38 MAPK and p65 NF-kappaB phosphorylation but not JNK phosphorylation that occurred in the Abeta(1-40)-injected hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that NaHS could significantly ameliorate Abeta(1-40)-induced spatial learning and memory impairment, apoptosis, and neuroinflammation at least in part via the inhibition of p38 MAPK and p65 NF-kappaB activity, suggesting that administration of NaHS could provide a therapeutic approach for AD.

22902274|t|A ternary complex consisting of AICD, FE65, and TIP60 down-regulates Stathmin1.
22902274|a|The ternary complex consisting of AICD/FE65/TIP60 is thought to play a role in gene expression and was suggested to have a crucial impact in Alzheimer's disease. AICD is the intracellular subdomain of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and able to bind the adapter protein FE65 and the histone acetyltransferase TIP60 setting up a nuclear dot-like phenotype. Within this work we readdressed the generation of the complex as a function of its compartments. Subsequently, we studied the proteome of AFT expressing cells vs. controls and identified Stathmin1 significantly down-regulated in AFT cells. Stathmin1 functions as an important regulatory protein of microtubule dynamics and was found associated with neurofibrillary tangles in brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. We validated our results using an independent label-free mass spectrometry based method using the same cell culture model. In a reversal model with diminished APP expression, caused by simultaneous knock-down of all three members of the APP family, we further confirmed our results, as Stathmin1 was regulated in an opposite fashion. We hypothesize that AICD-dependent deregulation of Stathmin1 causes microtubule disorganization, which might play an important role for the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease.

22903058|t|Fiber diffraction data indicate a hollow core for the Alzheimer's abeta 3-fold symmetric fibril.
22903058|a|Amyloid beta protein (Abeta), the principal component of the extracellular plaques found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease, forms fibrils well suited to structural study by X-ray fiber diffraction. Fiber diffraction patterns from the 40-residue form Abeta(1-40) confirm a number of features of a 3-fold symmetric Abeta model from solid-state NMR (ssNMR) but suggest that the fibrils have a hollow core not present in the original ssNMR models. Diffraction patterns calculated from a revised 3-fold hollow model with a more regular beta-sheet structure are in much better agreement with the observed diffraction data than patterns calculated from the original ssNMR model. Refinement of a hollow-core model against ssNMR data led to a revised ssNMR model, similar to the fiber diffraction model.

22906069|t|High-energy compounds promote physiological processing of Alzheimer's amyloid-beta precursor protein and boost cell survival in culture.
22906069|a|Physiological or alpha-processing of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) prevents the formation of Abeta, which is deposited in the aging brain and may contribute to Alzheimer's disease. As such, drugs promoting this pathway could be useful for prevention of the disease. Along this line, we searched through a number of substances and unexpectedly found that a group of high-energy compounds (HECs), namely ATP, phosphocreatine, and acetyl coenzyme A, potently increased APP alpha-processing in cultured SH-SY5Y cells, whereas their cognate counterparts, i.e., ADP, creatine, or coenzyme A did not show the same effects. Other HECs such as GTP, CTP, phosphoenol pyruvate, and S-adenosylmethionine also promoted APP alpha-processing with varying potencies and the effects were abolished by energy inhibitors rotenone or NaN(3). The overall efficacy of the HECs in the process ranged from three- to four-fold, which was significantly greater than that exhibited by other physiological stimulators such as glutamate and nicotine. This suggested that the HECs were perhaps the most efficient physiological stimulators for APP alpha-processing. Moreover, the HECs largely offset the inefficient APP alpha-processing in aged human fibroblasts or in cells impaired by rotenone or H(2) O(2). Most importantly, some HECs markedly boosted the survival rate of SH-SY5Y cells in the death process induced by energy suppression or oxidative stress. These findings suggest a new, energy-dependent regulatory mechanism for the putative alpha-secretase and thus will help substantially in its identification. At the same time, the study raises the possibility that the HECs may be useful to energize and strengthen the aging brain cells to slow down the progression of Alzheimer's disease.

22906269|t|The therapeutic effect of (DL)-3-n-butylphthalide in rats with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion through downregulation of amyloid precursor protein and matrix metalloproteinase-2.
22906269|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the therapeutic effect of DL-3-n-butylphthalide (DL-NBP) in rats with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. METHODS: Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion was modelled by bilateral permanent occlusion of common carotid arteries in Wistar rats. The therapeutic effect  of DL-NBP in hypoperfused rats was evaluated using the Morris water maze task. The levels and deposition of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and the amyloid precursor protein beta-amyloid 40 (Abeta40) were measured by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry in the cerebral cortex  and hippocampus. RESULTS: Treatment with DL-NBP significantly improved the learning and memory ability of hypoperfused rats. Western blot analysis indicated that, in comparison with the sham-operated control group, protein levels of Abeta40 and MMP-2 were significantly increased in the cerebral  cortex of hypoperfused rats, and treatment with DL-NBP prevented this hypoperfusion-induced increase in Abeta40 and MMP-2. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that Abeta40 and MMP-2 were deposited in venous endothelial cells at day 3 and in arterial endothelial cells at day 14 after hypoperfusion. CONCLUSION: This study indicated that DL-NBP has therapeutic effects on chronic cerebral hypoperfusion and provided a useful insight into the potential molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effect of DL-NBP in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion.

22907230|t|Peripheral muscle weakness in RASopathies.
22907230|a|INTRODUCTION: RASopathies are a group of genetic conditions due to alterations of the Ras/MAPK pathway. Neurocutaneous findings are hallmark features of the RASopathies, but musculoskeletal abnormalities are also frequent. The objective was to evaluate handgrip strength in the RASopathies. METHODS: Individuals with RASopathies (e.g., Noonan syndrome, Costello syndrome, cardio-facio-cutaneous [CFC] syndrome, and neurofibromatosis type 1 [NF1]) and healthy controls were evaluated. Two methods of handgrip strength were tested: GRIP-D Takei Hand Grip Dynamometer and the Martin vigorimeter. A general linear model was fitted to compare average strength among the groups, controlling for confounders such as age, gender, height, and weight. RESULTS: Takei dynamometer: handgrip strength was decreased in each of the syndromes compared with controls. Decreased handgrip strength compared with sibling controls was also seen with the Martin vigorimeter (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Handgrip strength is decreased in the RASopathies. The etiology of the reduced muscle force is unknown, but likely multifactorial.

22908632|t|Comparison of two ferns (Adiantum capillus-veneris Linn. and Microsorium punctatum (Linn.) Copel) for their Cr accumulation potential and antioxidant responses.
22908632|a|Study was undertaken to compare Cr accumulation in two ferns (Adiantum capillus-veneris Linn. and Microsorium punctatum (Linn.) Copel) and the role of antioxidants were also investigated towards metal tolerance in order to assess the use of ferns in phytomediation/ phytostabilization. Different concentrations (0, 50, 100, 150 microg g(-1) dw) of Cr were added to fern planted in pot containing 1 kg soil. In both the ferns, Cr accumulation increased with increase in metal concentration and maximum accumulation of 800.5 microg g(-1) (fronds) and 1457.4 microg g(-1) (roots) in M. punctatum and 660.8 microg g(-1) (fronds) and 1259.6 microg g(-1) (roots) in A. capillus-veneris was recorded. The increase in the levels of malondialdehyde, antioxidants and antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase) in A. capillus-veneris was less pronounced than M. punctatum under Cr exposure as compared to their respective controls. In view of less decrease in chlorophyll content and antioxidants along with higher accumulation of Cr in the fronds M. punctatum, is indicative of its higher tolerance towards Cr. However, bioaccumulation factor (concentration of Cr in fronds/concentration of Cr in the soil) of both the ferns was recorded > 1 which qualifies the plants as potential Cr hyperaccumulator and suitable for phytoremediaton.

22910376|t|Site-specific structure of Abeta(25-35) peptide: isotope-assisted vibrational circular dichroism study.
22910376|a|We investigated the site-specific local structure of an amyloid peptide, NH(2)-GSNKGAIIGLM-COOH [Abeta(25-35)], one of the active fragments of amyloid beta peptide that is known to be responsible for Alzheimer's disease, in the fibrillar aggregated state. Isotope-assisted infrared vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) and absorption (VA) spectroscopy were used for the parent Abeta(25-35) peptide, along with doubly (13)C labeled peptides at the carbonyl groups of residues 29 (Gly) and 30 (Ala) [Abeta(25-35:(13)C-29/30)] and at the carbonyl groups of residues 33 (Gly) and 34 (Leu) [Abeta(25-35:(13)C-33/34)]. The present results confirm that Abeta(25-35) peptide fibrils adopt a beta-sheet structure and isotopic dilution experiments suggest a parallel beta-sheet structure. The isotopic shifts suggest that the microenvironment of residues 29 (Gly) and 30 (Ala) could be different from that of residues 33 (Gly) and 34 (Leu). An unusual enhancement for the amide II' VCD intensities of Abeta(25-35:(13)C-29/30) and Abeta(25-35:(13)C-33/34) peptide fibrils, considered to originate from inter-strand coupling, was found for the first time. The structural information reported in this manuscript has important implications in understanding the role of this peptide in the development of Alzheimer's disease.

22911491|t|Correlations of CSF tau and amyloid levels with Alzheimer pathology in neuropathologically verified dementia with Lewy bodies.
22911491|a|OBJECTIVE: The presence of concomitant Alzheimer pathology has been linked to earlier death in cases with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Recently, elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau protein levels have been reported to be associated with shorter survival in clinically diagnosed DLB. Correlations between CSF biomarkers and neuropathological findings in DLB are missing. The aim of this study was to investigate correlations between CSF biomarker levels and histopathological findings, with a focus on concomitant Alzheimer pathology, in neuropathologically verified DLB cases. METHODS: The extent of neurofibrillary pathology (Braak stage), neuritic plaques (CERAD stage), Alzheimer pathology (PPAD9 stage) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy was assessed in 16 cases with DLB in whom total tau (T-tau), hyperphosphorylated tau and amyloid beta 1-42 (Abeta42) protein levels in CSF had been analyzed in vivo. Demographic and clinical data were collected. RESULTS: Both Braak and PPAD9 stages were inversely correlated with Abeta42 levels, whereas CERAD stage showed no significant correlations. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy correlated positively with T-tau and T-tau/Abeta42 ratio, and inversely with Abeta42 levels, but the group showed a very heterogeneous extent of cerebral amyloid angiopathy. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of concomitant Alzheimer pathology correlates with CSF Abeta42 but not with T-tau levels in cases with neuropathologically defined DLB.

22913544|t|Bis(arylvinyl)pyrazines, -pyrimidines, and -pyridazines as imaging agents for tau fibrils and beta-amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease models.
22913544|a|The in vivo diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is of high socioeconomic interest and remains a demanding field of research. The biopathological hallmarks of the disease are extracellular plaques consisting of aggregated beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta) and tau protein derived intracellular tangles. Here we report the synthesis and evaluation of fluorescent pyrazine, pyrimidine,and pyridazine derivatives in vitro and in vivo aiming at a tau-based diagnosis of AD. The probes were pre-evaluated on human brain tissue by fluorescence microscopy and were found to label all known disease-related alterations at high contrast and specificity. To quantify the binding affinity, a new thiazine red displacement assay was developed and selected candidates were toxicologically profiled. The application in transgenic mouse models demonstrated bioavailability and brain permeability for one compound. In the course of histological testing, we discovered an AD-related deposition of tau aggregates in the Bowman's glands of the olfactory epithelium, which holds potential for an endoscopic diagnosis of AD in the olfactory system.

22913627|t|Abeta oligomer toxicity inhibitor protects memory in models of synaptic toxicity.
22913627|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregation into synaptotoxic, prefibrillar oligomers is a major pathogenic event underlying the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The pharmacological and neuroprotective properties of a novel Abeta aggregation inhibitor, SEN1269, were investigated on aggregation and cell viability and in test systems relevant to synaptic function and memory, using both synthetic Abeta(1-42)  and cell-derived Abeta oligomers. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Surface plasmon resonance studies measured binding of SEN1269 to Abeta(1-42) . Thioflavin-T fluorescence and MTT assays were used to measure its ability to block Abeta(1-42) -induced aggregation and reduction in cell viability. In vitro and in vivo long-term potentiation (LTP) experiments measured the effect of SEN1269 on deficits induced by synthetic Abeta(1-42)  and cell-derived Abeta oligomers. Following i.c.v. administration of the latter, a complex (alternating-lever cyclic ratio) schedule of operant responding measured effects on memory in freely moving rats. KEY RESULTS: SEN1269 demonstrated direct binding to monomeric Abeta(1-42) , produced a concentration-related blockade of Abeta(1-42)  aggregation and protected neuronal cell lines exposed to Abeta(1-42) . In vitro, SEN1269 alleviated deficits in hippocampal LTP induced by Abeta(1-42)  and cell-derived Abeta oligomers. In vivo, SEN1269 reduced the deficits in LTP and memory induced by i.c.v. administration of cell-derived Abeta oligomers. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: SEN1269 protected cells exposed to Abeta(1-42) , displayed central activity with respect to reducing Abeta-induced neurotoxicity and was neuroprotective in electrophysiological and behavioural models of memory relevant to Abeta-induced neurodegeneration. It represents a promising lead for designing inhibitors of Abeta-mediated synaptic toxicity as potential neuroprotective agents for treating AD.

22913737|t|Reduction of hippocampal apoptosis by intracerebroventricular administration of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase and/or p38 inhibitors in amyloid beta rat model of Alzheimer's disease: involvement of nuclear-related factor-2 and nuclear factor-kappaB.
22913737|a|In the present study, we examined the effects of intracerebroventricular administration of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase- (ERK) and p38-specific inhibitors, U0126 and PD169316, respectively, on apoptosis induced by amyloid beta (Abeta) in rats. To investigate the effects of these compounds, we evaluated intracellular signalling pathways of apoptosis, as well as inflammatory and antioxidant pathways, 7 and 20 days after Abeta injection. We found that caspase-3 and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, two hallmarks of apoptosis, were significantly decreased in the rats pre-treated with U0126 and PD169316, 7 days after Abeta injection. This observation was in agreement with the results of immunostaining analysis of the hippocampus that showed decreased levels of terminal transferase dUTP nick end labelling positive cells in the hippocampus of U0126 and PD169316 pre-treated rats, compared with the Abeta-injected group. We also chased the changes in the levels of calpain-2 and caspase-12, two ER factors, in the Abeta-injected and treatment groups. Decreased levels of calpain-2 and caspase-12 in U0126 and PD169316 pre-treated rats confirmed the protective effects of these inhibitors. Furthermore, we studied the effect of two stress-sensing transcription factors, nuclear-related factor-2 (Nrf2) and nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB), in Abeta-injected as wells as U0126 and PD169316 pre-treated rats. U0126 and PD169316 activated Nrf2 and suppressed NF-kB pathways, 7 days after Abeta injection. These antioxidant and inflammatory pathways restored to the vehicle level within 20 days. Taken together, our findings reinforce and extend the notion of the potential neuroprotective role of ERK and/or p38 inhibitors against the neuronal toxicity induced by Abeta.

22915123|t|Ryanodine receptor blockade reduces amyloid-beta load and memory impairments in Tg2576 mouse model of Alzheimer disease.
22915123|a|In Alzheimer disease (AD), the perturbation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis has been linked to presenilins, the catalytic core in gamma-secretase complexes cleaving the amyloid precursor protein (APP), thereby generating amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides. Here we investigate whether APP contributes to ER Ca2+ homeostasis and whether ER Ca2+ could in turn influence Abeta production. We show that overexpression of wild-type human APP (APP(695)), or APP harboring the Swedish double mutation (APP(swe)) triggers increased ryanodine receptor (RyR) expression and enhances RyR-mediated ER Ca2+ release in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and in APP(swe)-expressing (Tg2576) mice. Interestingly, dantrolene-induced lowering of RyR-mediated Ca2+ release leads to the reduction of both intracellular and extracellular Abeta load in neuroblastoma cells as well as in primary cultured neurons derived from Tg2576 mice. This Abeta reduction can be accounted for by decreased Thr-668-dependent APP phosphorylation and beta- and gamma-secretases activities. Importantly, dantrolene diminishes Abeta load, reduces Abeta-related histological lesions, and slows down learning and memory deficits in Tg2576 mice. Overall, our data document a key role of RyR in Abeta production and learning and memory performances, and delineate RyR-mediated control of Ca2+ homeostasis as a physiological paradigm that could be targeted for innovative therapeutic approaches.

22915585|t|Soluble prion protein inhibits amyloid-beta (Abeta) fibrillization and toxicity.
22915585|a|The pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease appears to be strongly linked to the aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide and, especially, formation of soluble Abeta1-42 oligomers. It was recently demonstrated that the cellular prion protein, PrP(C), binds with high affinity to these oligomers, acting as a putative receptor that mediates at least some of their neurotoxic effects. Here we show that the soluble (i.e. glycophosphatidylinositol anchor-free) prion protein and its N-terminal fragment have a strong effect on the aggregation pathway of Abeta1-42, inhibiting its assembly into amyloid fibrils. Furthermore, the prion protein prevents formation of spherical oligomers that normally occur during Abeta fibrillogenesis, acting as a potent inhibitor of Abeta1-42 toxicity as assessed in experiments with neuronal cell culture. These findings may provide a molecular level foundation to explain the reported protective action of the physiologically released N-terminal N1 fragment of PrP(C) against Abeta neurotoxicity. They also suggest a novel approach to pharmacological intervention in Alzheimer disease.

22921154|t|Leptin prevents hippocampal synaptic disruption and neuronal cell death induced by amyloid beta.
22921154|a|Accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) is a key event mediating the cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) as Abeta promotes synaptic dysfunction and triggers neuronal death. Recent evidence has linked the hormone leptin to AD as leptin levels are markedly attenuated in AD patients. Leptin is also a potential cognitive enhancer as it facilitates the cellular events underlying hippocampal learning and memory. Here we show that leptin prevents the detrimental effects of Abeta(1-42) on hippocampal long-term potentiation. Moreover leptin inhibits Abeta(1-42)-driven facilitation of long-term depression and internalization of the 2-amino-3-(5-methyl-3-oxo-1,2- oxazol-4-yl)propanoic acid (AMPA) receptor subunit, GluR1, via activation of PI3-kinase. Leptin also protects cortical neurons from Abeta(1-42)-induced cell death by a signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3)-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, leptin inhibits Abeta(1-42)-mediated upregulation of endophilin I and phosphorylated tau in vitro, whereas cortical levels of endophilin I and phosphorylated tau are enhanced in leptin-insensitive Zucker fa/fa rats. Thus leptin benefits the functional characteristics and viability of neurons that degenerate in AD. These novel findings establish that the leptin system is an important therapeutic target in neurodegenerative conditions.

22922253|t|Mining the secrets of the CSF: developing biomarkers of neurodegeneration.
22922253|a|Our ability to track the progression of neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease (PD) is hampered by a lack of biomarkers, rendering the neuronal changes that underlie clinical symptoms largely a mystery. In this issue of the JCI, Fanara et al. report the development of an innovative approach to biomarker development. They describe a method to measure axonal microtubule function via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling and use this technique to provide evidence of deficiencies in this process in PD patients. This both sheds light on the pathophysiology of PD and has implications for the more general problem of developing biomarkers for any brain process.

22922254|t|Cerebrospinal fluid-based kinetic biomarkers of axonal transport in monitoring neurodegeneration.
22922254|a|Progress in neurodegenerative disease research is hampered by the lack of biomarkers of neuronal dysfunction. We here identified a class of cerebrospinal fluid-based (CSF-based) kinetic biomarkers that reflect altered neuronal transport of protein cargo, a common feature of neurodegeneration. After a pulse administration of heavy water (2H2O), distinct, newly synthesized 2H-labeled neuronal proteins were transported to nerve terminals and secreted, and then appeared in CSF. In 3 mouse models of neurodegeneration, distinct 2H-cargo proteins displayed delayed appearance and disappearance kinetics in the CSF, suggestive of aberrant transport kinetics. Microtubule-modulating pharmacotherapy normalized CSF-based kinetics of affected 2H-cargo proteins and ameliorated neurodegenerative symptoms in mice. After 2H2O labeling, similar neuronal transport deficits were observed in CSF of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) compared with non-PD control subjects, which indicates that these biomarkers are translatable and relevant to human disease. Measurement of transport kinetics may provide a sensitive method to monitor progression of neurodegeneration and treatment effects.

22922786|t|Orchestrated experience-driven Arc responses are disrupted in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
22922786|a|Experience-induced expression of immediate-early gene Arc (also known as Arg3.1) is known to be important for consolidation of memory. Using in vivo longitudinal multiphoton imaging, we found orchestrated activity-dependent expression of Arc in the mouse extrastriate visual cortex in response to a structured visual stimulation. In wild-type mice, the amplitude of the Arc response in individual neurons strongly predicted the probability of reactivation by a subsequent presentation of the same stimulus. In a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, this association was markedly disrupted in the cortex, specifically near senile plaques. Neurons in the vicinity of plaques were less likely to respond, but, paradoxically, there were stronger responses in those few neurons around plaques that did respond. To the extent that the orchestrated pattern of Arc expression reflects nervous system responses to and physiological consolidation of behavioral experience, the disruption in Arc patterns reveals plaque-associated interference with neural network integration.

22925831|t|What's hAPPening at synapses? The role of amyloid beta-protein precursor and beta-amyloid in neurological disorders.
22925831|a|Accumulating evidence suggests that dysregulated levels of amyloid beta-protein precursor (APP) and its catabolites contribute to the impaired synaptic plasticity and seizure incidence observed in several neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, fragile X syndrome, Down's syndrome, autism, epilepsy and Parkinson's disease as well as in brain injury. This review article summarizes what is known regarding the synaptic synthesis, processing and function of APP and amyloid-beta (Abeta), as well as discusses how these proteins could contribute to the altered synaptic plasticity and pathology of the aforementioned disorders. In addition, APP and its proteolytic fragments are emerging as biomarkers for neurological health, and pharmacological interventions that modulate their levels, such as secretase inhibitors, passive immunotherapy against Abeta and mGluR5 antagonists, are reviewed.

22926141|t|Abnormal interaction of VDAC1 with amyloid beta and phosphorylated tau causes mitochondrial dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.
22926141|a|The purpose of our study was to determine the relationship between voltage-dependent anion channel 1 protein (VDAC1) and amyloid beta (Abeta) and phosphorylated tau in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using brain specimens from AD patients, control subjects and 6-, 12- and 24-month-old Abeta precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice, we studied VDAC1 protein levels. Further, we also studied the interaction between VDAC1 and Abeta (monomers and oligomers) and phosphorylated tau, using cortical issues from AD patients, control subjects, APP, APP/PS1 and 3XTg.AD mice. We also studied age- and VDAC1-linked, mutant APP/Abeta-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in APP and non-transgenic wild-type (WT) mice. We found progressively increased levels of VDAC1 in the cortical tissues from the brains of patients with AD, relative to control subjects, and significantly increased levels of VDAC1 in the cerebral cortices of 6-, 12- and 24-month-old APP transgenic mice, relative to the age-matched control WT mice. Interestingly, we found VDAC1 interacted with Abeta and phosphorylated tau in the brains from AD patients and from APP, APP/PS1 and 3XTg.AD mice. We found progressively increased mitochondrial dysfunction in APP mice relative to WT mice. These observations led us to conclude that VDAC1 interacts with Abeta, and phosphorylated tau may in turn block mitochondrial pores, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD pathogenesis. Based on current study observations, we propose that reduced levels of VDAC1, Abeta and phosphorylated tau may reduce the abnormal interaction between VDAC1 and APP, VDAC1 and Abeta, and VDAC1 and phosphorylated tau; and that reduced levels of VDAC1, Abeta and phosphorylated tau may maintain normal mitochondrial pore opening and pore closure, ultimately leading to normal mitochondrial function, mitochondria supplying ATP to nerve terminals and boosting synaptic and cognitive function in AD.

22926714|t|Quantitative longitudinal interrelationships between brain metabolism and amyloid deposition during a 2-year follow-up in patients with early Alzheimer's disease.
22926714|a|PURPOSE: Similar regional anatomical distributions were reported for fibrillary amyloid deposition [measured by (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) positron emission tomography (PET)] and brain hypometabolism [measured by (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET] in numerous Alzheimer's disease (AD) studies. However, there is a lack of longitudinal studies evaluating the interrelationships of these two different pathological markers in the same AD population. Our most recent AD study suggested that the longitudinal pattern of hypometabolism anatomically follows the pattern of amyloid deposition with temporal delay, which indicates that neuronal dysfunction may spread within the anatomical pattern of amyloid pathology. Based on this finding we now hypothesize that in early AD patients quantitative longitudinal decline in hypometabolism may be related to the amount of baseline amyloid deposition during a follow-up period of 2 years. METHODS: Fifteen patients with mild probable AD underwent baseline (T1) and follow-up (T2) examination after 24 +- 2.1 months with [(18)F]FDG PET, [(11)C]PIB PET, structural T1-weighted MRI and neuropsychological testing [Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) neuropsychological battery]. Longitudinal cognitive measures and quantitative PET measures of amyloid deposition and metabolism [standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs)] were obtained using volume of interest (VOI)-based approaches in the frontal-lateral-retrosplenial (FLR) network and in predefined bihemispheric brain regions after partial volume effect (PVE) correction of PET data. Statistical group comparisons (SUVRs and cognitive measures) between patients and 15 well-matched elderly controls who had undergone identical imaging procedures once as well as Pearson's correlation analyses within patients were performed. RESULTS: Group comparison revealed significant cognitive decline and increased mean PIB/decreased FDG SUVRs in the FLR network as well as in several AD-typical regions in patients relative to controls. Concurrent with cognitive decline patients showed longitudinal increase in mean PIB/decrease in mean FDG SUVRs over time in the FLR network and in several AD-typical brain regions. Correlation analyses of FLR network SUVRs in patients revealed significant positive correlations between PIB T1 and delta FDG (FDG T1-T2) SUVRs, between PIB T1 and PIB T2 SUVRs, between FDG T1 and PIB T2 SUVRs as well as between FDG T1 and FDG T2 SUVRs, while significant negative correlations were found between FDG T1 and delta PIB (PIB T1-T2) SUVRs as well as between FDG T2 and delta FDG (FDG T1-T2) SUVRs. These findings were confirmed in locoregional correlation analyses, revealing significant associations in the same directions for two left hemispheric regions and nine right hemispheric regions, showing the strongest association for bilateral precuneus. CONCLUSION: Baseline amyloid deposition in patients with mild probable AD was associated with longitudinal metabolic decline. Additionally, mildly decreased/relatively preserved baseline metabolism was associated with a longitudinal increase in amyloid deposition. The latter bidirectional associations were present in the whole AD-typical FLR network and in several highly interconnected hub regions (i.e. in the precuneus). Our longitudinal findings point to a bidirectional quantitative interrelationship of the two investigated AD pathologies, comprising an initial relative maintenance of neuronal activity in already amyloid-positive hub regions (neuronal compensation), followed by accelerated amyloid deposition, accompanied by functional neuronal decline (neuronal breakdown) along with cognitive decline.

22930270|t|Inactivating ion channels augment robustness of subthreshold intrinsic response dynamics to parametric variability in hippocampal model neurons.
22930270|a|Voltage-gated ion channels play a critical role in regulating neuronal intrinsic response dynamics (IRD). Here, we computationally analysed the roles of the two inactivating subthreshold conductances (A and T), individually and in various combinations with the non-inactivating h conductance, in regulating several physiological IRD measurements in the theta frequency range. We found that the independent presence of a T conductance, unlike that of an h conductance, was unable to sustain an inductive phase lead in the theta frequency range, despite its ability to mediate theta frequency resonance. The A conductance, on the other hand, when expressed independently, acted in a manner similar to a leak conductance with reference to most IRD measurements. Next, analysing the impact of pair-wise coexpression of these channels, we found that the coexpression of the h and T conductances augmented the range of parameters over which they sustained resonance and inductive phase lead. Additionally, coexpression of the A conductance with the h or the T conductance elicited changes in IRD measurements that were similar to those obtained with the expression of a leak conductance with a resonating conductance. Finally, to understand the global sensitivity of IRD measurements to all parameters associated with models expressing all three channels, we generated 100,000 neuronal models, each built with a unique set of parametric values. We categorized valid models among these by matching their IRD measurements with experimental counterparts, and found that functionally similar models could be achieved even when underlying parameters displayed tremendous variability and exhibited weak pair-wise correlations. Our results suggest that the three prominent subthreshold conductances contribute differently to intrinsic excitability and to phase coding. We postulate that the differential expression and activity-dependent plasticity of these conductances contribute to robustness of subthreshold IRD, whereby response homeostasis is achieved by recruiting several non-unique combinations of these channel parameters.

22933778|t|Adaptor protein APPL1 couples synaptic NMDA receptor with neuronal prosurvival phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway.
22933778|a|It is well known that NMDA receptors (NMDARs) can both induce neurotoxicity and promote neuronal survival under different circumstances. Recent studies show that such paradoxical responses are related to the receptor location: the former to the extrasynaptic and the latter to the synaptic. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt kinase cascade is a key pathway responsible for the synaptic NMDAR-dependent neuroprotection. However, it is still unknown how synaptic NMDARs are coupled with the PI3K/Akt pathway. Here, we explored the role of an adaptor protein-adaptor protein containing pH domain, PTB domain, and leucine zipper motif (APPL1)-in this signal coupling using rat cortical neurons. We found that APPL1 existed in postsynaptic densities and associated with the NMDAR complex through binding to PSD95 at its C-terminal PDZ-binding motif. NMDARs, APPL1, and the PI3K/Akt cascade formed a complex in rat cortical neurons. Synaptic NMDAR activity increased the association of this complex, induced activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, and consequently protected neurons against starvation-induced apoptosis. Perturbing APPL1 interaction with PSD95 by a peptide comprising the APPL1 C-terminal PDZ-binding motif dissociated the PI3K/Akt pathway from NMDARs. Either the peptide or lentiviral knockdown of APPL1 blocked synaptic NMDAR-dependent recruitment and activation of PI3K/Akt pathway, and consequently blocked synaptic NMDAR-dependent neuroprotection. These results suggest that APPL1 contributes to connecting synaptic NMDARs with the intracellular PI3K/Akt cascade and the downstream prosurvival signaling pathway in rat cortical neurons.

22940003|t|Crystal structure of a conformation-dependent rabbit IgG Fab specific for amyloid prefibrillar oligomers.
22940003|a|BACKGROUND: Although rabbit antibodies are widely used in research, no structures of rabbit antigen-binding fragments (Fab) have been reported. M204 is a rabbit monoclonal antibody that recognizes a generic epitope that is common to prefibrillar amyloid oligomers formed from many different amyloidogenic sequences. Amyloid oligomers are widely suspected to be a primary causative agent of pathogenesis in several age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. The detailed structure of these amyloid oligomers is not known nor is the mechanism for the recognition of the generic epitope by conformation-dependent monoclonal antibodies. METHOD: As a first approach to understanding the mechanism of conformation-dependent antibody recognition, we have crystallized the Fab of M204. RESULTS: We have determined the structure of the Fab of M204 at 1.54A resolution. The crystal structure reveals details of the M204 antigen combining site and features unique to rabbit Fabs such as an interdomain disulfide bond on its light chain. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Based on the structural features of the antigen-combining site of the M204, we rule out a "steric zipper" formation, as found in numerous amyloid fibril structures, as a mechanism of antibody-antigen recognition. The details of the first rabbit immunoglobulin Fab structure might also be useful for exploiting the potential of rabbit monoclonal antibodies for the development of humanized rabbit antibodies as therapeutic agents.

22940640|t|The effect of fulvic acid on pre- and postaggregation state of Abeta(17-42): molecular dynamics simulation studies.
22940640|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder, is directly related to the aggregation of Abeta peptides. These peptides can self-assemble from monomers to higher oligomeric or fibrillar structures in a highly ordered and efficient manner. This self-assembly process is accompanied by a structural transition of the aggregated proteins from their normal fold into a predominantly beta-sheet secondary structure. 14ns molecular dynamics simulation revealed that fulvic acid interrupted the dimer formation of Abeta(17-42) peptide while in its absence Abeta(17-42) dimer formation occurred at ~12ns. Additionally, fulvic acid disrupted the preformed Abeta(17-42) trimer in a very short time interval (12ns). These results may provide an insight in the drug design against Abeta(17-42) peptide aggregation using fulvic acid as lead molecule against Abeta(17-42) mediated cytotoxicity and neurodegeneration.

22944394|t|Stability of early-stage amyloid-beta(1-42) aggregation species.
22944394|a|Accumulation of aggregated amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) is an important feature of Alzheimer's disease. There is significant interest in understanding the initial steps of Abeta aggregation due to the recent focus on soluble Abeta oligomers. In vitro studies of Abeta aggregation have been aided by the use of conformation-specific antibodies which recognize shape rather than sequence. One of these, OC antiserum, recognizes certain elements of fibrillar Abeta across a broad range of sizes. We have observed the presence of these fibrillar elements at very early stages of Abeta incubation. Using a dot blot assay, OC-reactivity was found in size exclusion chromatography (SEC)-purified Abeta(1-42) monomer fractions immediately after isolation (early-stage). The OC-reactivity was not initially observed in the same fractions for Abeta(1-40) or the aggregation-restricted Abeta(1-42) L34P but was detected within 1-2weeks of incubation. Stability studies demonstrated that early-stage OC-positive Abeta(1-42) aggregates were resistant to 4M urea or guanidine hydrochloride but sensitive to 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Interestingly, the sensitivity to SDS diminished over time upon incubation of the SEC-purified Abeta(1-42) solution at 4 C. Within 6-8days the OC-positive Abeta42 aggregates were resistant to SDS denaturation. The progression to, and development of, SDS resistance for Abeta(1-42) occurred prior to thioflavin T fluorescence. In contrast, Abeta(1-40) aggregates formed after 6days of incubation were sensitive to both urea and SDS. These findings reveal information on some of the earliest events in Abeta aggregation and suggest that it may be possible to target early-stage aggregates before they develop significant stability.

22947861|t|Binding of beta-amyloid (1-42) peptide to negatively charged phospholipid membranes in the liquid-ordered state: modeling and experimental studies.
22947861|a|To explore the initial stages of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta42) deposition on membranes, we have studied the interaction of Abeta42 in the monomeric form with lipid monolayers and with bilayers in either the liquid-disordered or the liquid-ordered (L(o)) state, containing negatively charged phospholipids. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the system have been performed, as well as experimental measurements. For bilayers in the L(o) state, in the absence of the negatively charged lipids, interaction is weak and it cannot be detected by isothermal calorimetry. However, in the presence of phosphatidic acid, or of cardiolipin, interaction is detected by different methods and in all cases interaction is strongest with lower (2.5-5 mol%) than higher (10-20 mol%) proportions of negatively charged phospholipids. Liquid-disordered bilayers consistently allowed a higher Abeta42 binding than L(o) ones. Thioflavin T assays and infrared spectroscopy confirmed a higher proportion of beta-sheet formation under conditions when higher peptide binding was measured. The experimental results were supported by MD simulations. We used 100 ns MD to examine interactions between Abeta42 and three different 512 lipid bilayers consisting of palmitoylsphingomyelin, dimyristoyl phosphatidic acid, and cholesterol in three different proportions. MD pictures are different for the low- and high-charge bilayers, in the former case the peptide is bound through many contact points to the bilayer, whereas for the bilayer containing 20 mol% anionic phospholipid only a small fragment of the peptide appears to be bound. The MD results indicate that the binding and fibril formation on the membrane surface depends on the composition of the bilayer, and is the result of a subtle balance of many inter- and intramolecular interactions between the Abeta42 and membrane.

22947871|t|Binding of Congo red to amyloid protofibrils of the Alzheimer Abeta(9-40) peptide probed by molecular dynamics simulations.
22947871|a|Congo red (CR) is a commonly used histological amyloid dye and a weak amyloid inhibitor. There is currently no experimentally available structure of CR bound to an amyloid fibril and the binding modes, and the mechanisms governing its inhibitory and optical properties are poorly understood. In this work, we present the first, to our knowledge, atomistically detailed picture of CR binding to protofibrils of the Alzheimer Abeta(9-40) peptide. We identify three major binding modes, with the primary mode residing in the grooves formed by the beta-sheets, and observe a restriction of the torsional rotation of the CR molecule upon binding. Our simulations reveal a novel, to our knowledge, electrostatic steering mechanism that plays an important role in the initial recognition and binding of CR to the positively charged surface residues of the fibril. Our simulations provide new, to our knowledge, insights into the striking spectrophotometric and inhibitory properties of CR. In particular, we show that birefringence upon CR binding is due to the anisotropic orientation of the CR dipoles resulting from the spatial ordering of these molecules in the grooves along the fibril axis. The fluorescent enhancement of the bound CR, in turn, is associated with the torsional restriction of this molecule upon binding.

22947874|t|Role of beta-hairpin formation in aggregation: the self-assembly of the amyloid-beta(25-35) peptide.
22947874|a|The amyloid-beta(25-35) peptide plays a key role in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease due to its extreme toxicity even in the absence of aging. Because of its high tendency to aggregate and its low solubility in water, the structure of this peptide is still unknown. In this work, we sought to understand the early stages of aggregation of the amyloid-beta(25-35) peptide by conducting simulations of oligomers ranging from monomers to tetramers. Our simulations show that although the monomer preferentially adopts a beta-hairpin conformation, larger aggregates have extended structures, and a clear transition from compact beta-hairpin conformations to extended beta-strand structures occurs between dimers and trimers. Even though beta-hairpins are not present in the final architecture of the fibril, our simulations indicate that they play a critical role in fibril growth. Our simulations also show that beta-sheet structures are stabilized when a beta-hairpin is present at the edge of the sheet. The binding of the hairpin to the sheet leads to a subsequent destabilization of the hairpin, with part of the hairpin backbone dangling in solution. This free section of the peptide can then recruit an extra monomer from solution, leading to further sheet extension. Our simulations indicate that the peptide must possess sufficient conformational flexibility to switch between a hairpin and an extended conformation in order for beta-sheet extension to occur, and offer a rationalization for the experimental observation that overstabilizing a hairpin conformation in the monomeric state (for example, through chemical cross-linking) significantly hampers the fibrillization process.

22947919|t|Clinical features of Pittsburgh compound-B-negative dementia.
22947919|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: We previously found that some cases of clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (AD) were rated as Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) negative by amyloid imaging (i.e. cases of PiB-negative dementia). The present study was designed to analyze the clinical features of PiB-negative dementia patients in detail. METHODS: Of the 64 cases of clinically diagnosed AD, 14 were rated PiB negative. Eleven of these were further analyzed using CSF biomarker levels and findings from MRI, FDG-PET, (123)I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy and voxel-based morphometry (VBM). RESULTS: When examined by (123)I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy, the heart/mediastinum ratio was significantly higher in the PiB-negative dementia group than in the dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) group. Analyses of CSF biomarkers and MRI and FDG-PET findings suggested argyrophilic grain disease (AGD) in 3 cases, frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) in 3 cases, neurofibrillary tangle-predominant dementia (NFTD) in 1 case, and AD in 2 cases. In the VBM data analysis, the PiB-positive AD group showed significant atrophy of both hippocampi compared with the healthy control group, while the PiB-negative dementia group presented with significant atrophy of the left precuneus. CONCLUSION: PiB-negative dementia is unlikely to include DLB, while it most likely includes diseases of tauopathy, such as FTLD, AGD and NFTD. A better understanding of PiB-negative dementia is expected to further improve the accuracy of the clinical AD diagnosis.

22947931|t|Two-step mechanism of membrane disruption by Abeta through membrane fragmentation and pore formation.
22947931|a|Disruption of cell membranes by Abeta is believed to be one of the key components of Abeta toxicity. However, the mechanism by which this occurs is not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that membrane disruption by Abeta occurs by a two-step process, with the initial formation of ion-selective pores followed by nonspecific fragmentation of the lipid membrane during amyloid fiber formation. Immediately after the addition of freshly dissolved Abeta(1-40), defects form on the membrane that share many of the properties of Abeta channels originally reported from single-channel electrical recording, such as cation selectivity and the ability to be blockaded by zinc. By contrast, subsequent amyloid fiber formation on the surface of the membrane fragments the membrane in a way that is not cation selective and cannot be stopped by zinc ions. Moreover, we observed that the presence of ganglioside enhances both the initial pore formation and the fiber-dependent membrane fragmentation process. Whereas pore formation by freshly dissolved Abeta(1-40) is weakly observed in the absence of gangliosides, fiber-dependent membrane fragmentation can only be observed in their presence. These results provide insights into the toxicity of Abeta and may aid in the design of specific compounds to alleviate the neurodegeneration of Alzheimer's disease.

22947946|t|Nanoscale electrostatic domains in cholesterol-laden lipid membranes create a target for amyloid binding.
22947946|a|Amyloid fibrils are associated with multiple neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. Although biological membranes are involved in fibril plaque formation, the role of lipid membrane composition in fibril formation and toxicity is not well understood. We investigated the effect of cholesterol on the interaction of model lipid membranes with amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta). With atomic force microscopy we demonstrated that binding of Abeta (1-42) to DOPC bilayer, enriched with 20% cholesterol, resulted in an intriguing formation of small nonuniform islands loaded with Abeta. We attribute this effect to the presence of nanoscale electrostatic domains induced by cholesterol in DOPC bilayers. Using frequency-modulated Kelvin probe force microscopy we were able to resolve these nanoscale electrostatic domains in DOPC monolayers. These findings directly affect our understanding of how the presence of cholesterol may induce targeted binding of amyloid deposits to biomembranes. We postulate that this nonhomogeneous electrostatic effect of cholesterol has a fundamental nature and may be present in other lipid membranes and monolayers.

22948140|t|Overexpression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 and lactate dehydrogenase A in nerve cells confers resistance to amyloid beta and other toxins by decreasing mitochondrial respiration and reactive oxygen species production.
22948140|a|We previously demonstrated that nerve cell lines selected for resistance to amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide exhibit elevated aerobic glycolysis in part due to increased expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). Here, we show that overexpression of either PDK1 or LDHA in a rat CNS cell line (B12) confers resistance to Abeta and other neurotoxins. Treatment of Abeta-sensitive cells with various toxins resulted in mitochondrial hyperpolarization, immediately followed by rapid depolarization and cell death, events accompanied by increased production of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). In contrast, cells expressing either PDK1 or LDHA maintained a lower mitochondrial membrane potential and decreased ROS production with or without exposure to toxins. Additionally, PDK1- and LDHA-overexpressing cells exhibited decreased oxygen consumption but maintained levels of ATP under both normal culture conditions and following Abeta treatment. Interestingly, immunoblot analysis of wild type mouse primary cortical neurons treated with Abeta or cortical tissue extracts from 12-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice showed decreased expression of LDHA and PDK1 when compared with controls. Additionally, post-mortem brain extracts from patients with Alzheimer disease exhibited a decrease in PDK1 expression compared with nondemented patients. Collectively, these findings indicate that key Warburg effect enzymes play a central role in mediating neuronal resistance to Alphabeta or other neurotoxins by decreasing mitochondrial activity and subsequent ROS production. Maintenance of PDK1 or LDHA expression in certain regions of the brain may explain why some individuals tolerate high levels of Abeta deposition without developing Alzheimer disease.

22949636|t|Role of genes linked to sporadic Alzheimer's disease risk in the production of beta-amyloid peptides.
22949636|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of toxic protein aggregates or plaques composed of the amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide. Various lengths of Abeta peptide are generated by proteolytic cleavages of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Mutations in many familial AD-associated genes affect the production of the longer Abeta42 variant that preferentially accumulates in plaques. In the case of sporadic or late-onset AD, which accounts for greater than 95% of cases, several genes are implicated in increasing the risk, but whether they also cause the disease by altering amyloid levels is currently unknown. Through loss of function studies in a model cell line, here RNAi-mediated silencing of several late onset AD genes affected Abeta levels is shown. However, unlike the genes underlying familial AD, late onset AD-susceptibility genes do not specifically alter the Abeta42/40 ratios and suggest that these genes probably contribute to AD through distinct mechanisms.

22951070|t|Neuroimaging correlates of pathologically defined subtypes of Alzheimer's disease: a case-control study.
22951070|a|BACKGROUND: Three subtypes of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been pathologically defined on the basis of the distribution of neurofibrillary tangles: typical AD, hippocampal-sparing AD, and limbic-predominant AD. Compared with typical AD, hippocampal-sparing AD has more neurofibrillary tangles in the cortex and fewer in the hippocampus, whereas the opposite pattern is seen in limbic-predominant AD. We aimed to determine whether MRI patterns of atrophy differ between these subtypes and whether structural neuroimaging could be a useful predictor of pathological subtype at autopsy. METHODS: We identified patients who had been followed up in the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (Rochester, MN, USA) or in the Alzheimer's Disease Patient Registry (Rochester, MN, USA) between 1992 and 2005. To be eligible for inclusion, participants had to have had dementia, AD pathology at autopsy (Braak stage >=IV and intermediate to high probability of AD), and an ante-mortem MRI. Cases were assigned to one of three pathological subtypes--hippocampal-sparing, limbic-predominant, and typical AD--on the basis of neurofibrillary tangle counts in hippocampus and cortex and ratio of hippocampal to cortical burden, without reference to neuronal loss. Voxel-based morphometry and atlas-based parcellation were used to compare patterns of grey matter loss between groups and with age-matched control individuals. Neuroimaging was obtained at the time of first presentation. To summarise pair-wise group differences, we report the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC). FINDINGS: Of 177 eligible patients, 125 (71%) were classified as having typical AD, 33 (19%) as having limbic-predominant AD, and 19 (11%) as having hippocampal-sparing AD. Most patients with typical (98 [78%]) and limbic-predominant AD (31 [94%]) initially presented with an amnestic syndrome, but fewer patients with hippocampal-sparing AD (eight [42%]) did. The most severe medial temporal atrophy was recorded in patients with limbic-predominant AD, followed by those with typical disease, and then those with hippocampal-sparing AD. Conversely, the most severe cortical atrophy was noted in patients with hippocampal-sparing AD, followed by those with typical disease, and then limbic-predominant AD. The ratio of hippocampal to cortical volumes allowed the best discrimination between subtypes (p<0 0001; three-way AUROC 0 52 [95% CI 0 47-0 52]; ratio of AUROC to chance classification 3 1 [2 8-3 1]). Patients with typical AD and non-amnesic initial presentation had a significantly higher ratio of hippocampal to cortical volumes (median 0 045 [IQR 0 035-0 056]) than did those with an amnesic presentation (0 041 [0 031-0 057]; p=0 001). INTERPRETATION: Patterns of atrophy on MRI differ across the pathological subtypes of AD. MRI regional volumetric analysis can reliably track the distribution of neurofibrillary tangle pathology and can predict pathological subtype of AD at autopsy.

22952002|t|Werner coordination chemistry and neurodegeneration.
22952002|a|Neurodegenerative diseases are capturing the world's attention as being the next set of diseases we must tackle collectively. Not only are the patients experiencing gradual cognitive and physical decline in most cases, but these diseases are fatal with no prevention currently available. As these diseases are progressive, providing care and symptom treatment for the ageing population is becoming both a medical and a financial challenge. This review discusses how Werner coordination chemistry plays a role in three diseases - those of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and prions. Metal ions are considered to be involved in these diseases in part via their propensity to cause toxic aggregation of proteins. First, the coordination of metal ions, with emphasis on copper(II), to metalloproteins that are hallmarks of these diseases - amyloid beta, alpha-synuclein, and prion, respectively - will be discussed. We will present the current understanding of the metal coordination environments created by the amino acids of these proteins, as well as metal binding affinity. Second, a diverse set of examples of rationally designed metal chelators to outcompete this deleterious binding will be examined based on coordination mode and affinity toward bio-relevant metal ions. Overall, this review will give a general overview of protein and metal chelator coordination environments in neurodegenerative diseases.

22955124|t|Neurodegenerative causes of death among retired National Football League players.
22955124|a|OBJECTIVE: To analyze neurodegenerative causes of death, specifically Alzheimer disease (AD), Parkinson disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), among a cohort of professional football players. METHODS: This was a cohort mortality study of 3,439 National Football League players with at least 5 pension-credited playing seasons from 1959 to 1988. Vital status was ascertained through 2007. For analysis purposes, players were placed into 2 strata based on characteristics of position played: nonspeed players (linemen) and speed players (all other positions except punter/kicker). External comparisons with the US population used standardized mortality ratios (SMRs); internal comparisons between speed and nonspeed player positions used standardized rate ratios (SRRs). RESULTS: Overall player mortality compared with that of the US population was reduced (SMR 0.53, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.48-0.59). Neurodegenerative mortality was increased using both underlying cause of death rate files (SMR 2.83, 95% CI 1.36-5.21) and multiple cause of death (MCOD) rate files (SMR 3.26, 95% CI 1.90-5.22). Of the neurodegenerative causes, results were elevated (using MCOD rates) for both ALS (SMR 4.31, 95% CI 1.73-8.87) and AD (SMR 3.86, 95% CI 1.55-7.95). In internal analysis (using MCOD rates), higher neurodegenerative mortality was observed among players in speed positions compared with players in nonspeed positions (SRR 3.29, 95% CI 0.92-11.7). CONCLUSIONS: The neurodegenerative mortality of this cohort is 3 times higher than that of the general US population; that for 2 of the major neurodegenerative subcategories, AD and ALS, is 4 times higher. These results are consistent with recent studies that suggest an increased risk of neurodegenerative disease among football players.

22956200|t|Disruption of the sleep-wake cycle and diurnal fluctuation of beta-amyloid in mice with Alzheimer's disease pathology.
22956200|a|Aggregation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in the brain begins to occur years before the clinical onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Before Abeta aggregation, concentrations of extracellular soluble Abeta in the interstitial fluid (ISF) space of the brain, which are regulated by neuronal activity and the sleep-wake cycle, correlate with the amount of Abeta deposition in the brain seen later. The amount and quality of sleep decline with normal aging and to a greater extent in AD patients. How sleep quality as well as the diurnal fluctuation in Abeta change with age and Abeta aggregation is not well understood. We report a normal sleep-wake cycle and diurnal fluctuation in ISF Abeta in the brain of the APPswe/PS1deltaE9 mouse model of AD before Abeta plaque formation. After plaque formation, the sleep-wake cycle markedly deteriorated and diurnal fluctuation of ISF Abeta dissipated. As in mice, diurnal fluctuation of cerebrospinal fluid Abeta in young adult humans with presenilin mutations was also markedly attenuated after Abeta plaque formation. Virtual elimination of Abeta deposits in the mouse brain by active immunization with Abeta(42) normalized the sleep-wake cycle and the diurnal fluctuation of ISF Abeta. These data suggest that Abeta aggregation disrupts the sleep-wake cycle and diurnal fluctuation of Abeta. Sleep-wake behavior and diurnal fluctuation of Abeta in the central nervous system may be functional and biochemical indicators, respectively, of Abeta-associated pathology.

22958226|t|Decreased axonal transport rates in the Tg2576 APP transgenic mouse: improvement with the gamma-secretase inhibitor MRK-560 as detected by manganese-enhanced MRI.
22958226|a|Neuropil deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides is believed to be a key event in the neurodegenerative process of Alzheimer's disease (AD). An early and consistent clinical finding in AD is olfactory dysfunction with associated pathology. Interestingly, transgenic amyloid precursor protein (Tg2576) mice also show early amyloid pathology in olfactory regions. Moreover, a recent study indicates that axonal transport is compromised in the olfactory system of Tg2576 mice, as measured by manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI). Here we tested whether the putative axonal transport deficit in the Tg2576 mouse model improves in response to a selective gamma-secretase inhibitor, N-[cis-4-[(4-chlorophenyl)-sulfonyl]-4-(2,5-difluorophenyl)cyclohexyl]-1,1,1-trifluoromethanesulfonamide (MRK-560). Tg2576 mice or wild-type (WT) littermates were treated daily with MRK-560 (30 mumol/kg) or vehicle for 4 (acute) or 29 days (chronic). The subsequent MEMRI analysis revealed a distinct axonal transport dysfunction in the Tg2576 mice compared with its littermate controls. Interestingly, the impairment of axonal transport could be fully reversed by chronic administration of MRK-560, in line with the significantly lowered levels of both soluble and insoluble forms of Abeta found in the brain and olfactory bulbs (OBs) following treatment. However, no improvement of axonal transport was observed after acute treatment with MRK-560, where soluble but not insoluble forms of Abeta were reduced in the brain and OBs. The present results show that axonal transport is impaired in Tg2576 mice compared with WT controls, as measured by MEMRI. Chronic treatment in vivo with a gamma-secretase inhibitor, MRK-560, significantly reduces soluble and insoluble forms of Abeta, and fully reverses the axonal transport dysfunction.

22958823|t|JNK3 perpetuates metabolic stress induced by Abeta peptides.
22958823|a|Although Abeta peptides are causative agents in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the underlying mechanisms are still elusive. We report that Abeta42 induces a translational block by activating AMPK, thereby inhibiting the mTOR pathway. This translational block leads to widespread ER stress, which activates JNK3. JNK3 in turn phosphorylates APP at T668, thereby facilitating its endocytosis and subsequent processing. In support, pharmacologically blocking translation results in a significant increase in Abeta42 in a JNK3-dependent manner. Thus, JNK3 activation, which is increased in human AD cases and a familial AD (FAD) mouse model, is integral to perpetuating Abeta42 production. Concomitantly, deletion of JNK3 from FAD mice results in a dramatic reduction in Abeta42 levels and overall plaque loads and increased neuronal number and improved cognition. This reveals AD as a metabolic disease that is under tight control by JNK3.

22959217|t|Long-term use of standardised Ginkgo biloba extract for the prevention of Alzheimer's disease (GuidAge): a randomised placebo-controlled trial.
22959217|a|BACKGROUND: Prevention strategies are urgently needed to tackle the growing burden of Alzheimer's disease. We aimed to assess efficacy of long-term use of standardised ginkgo biloba extract for the reduction of incidence of Alzheimer's disease in elderly adults with memory complaints. METHODS: In the randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled GuidAge clinical trial, we enrolled adults aged 70 years or older who spontaneously reported memory complaints to their primary-care physician in France. We randomly allocated participants in a 1:1 ratio according to a computer-generated sequence to a twice per day dose of 120 mg standardised ginkgo biloba extract (EGb761) or matched placebo. Participants and study investigators and personnel were masked to study group assignment. Participants were followed-up for 5 years by primary-care physicians and in expert memory centres. The primary outcome was conversion to probable Alzheimer's disease in participants who received at least one dose of study drug or placebo, compared by use of the log-rank test. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00276510. FINDINGS: Between March, 2002, and November, 2004, we enrolled and randomly allocated 2854 participants, of whom 1406 received at least one dose of ginkgo biloba extract and 1414 received at least one dose of placebo. By 5 years, 61 participants in the ginkgo group had been diagnosed with probable Alzheimer's disease (1 2 cases per 100 person-years) compared with 73 participants in the placebo group (1 4 cases per 100 person-years; hazard ratio [HR] 0 84, 95% CI 0 60-1 18; p=0 306), but the risk was not proportional over time. Incidence of adverse events was much the same between groups. 76 participants in the ginkgo group died compared with 82 participants in the placebo group (0 94, 0 69-1 28; p=0 68). 65 participants in the ginkgo group had a stroke compared with 60 participants in the placebo group (risk ratio 1 12, 95% CI 0 77-1 63; p=0 57). Incidence of other haemorrhagic or cardiovascular events also did not differ between groups. INTERPRETATION: Long-term use of standardised ginkgo biloba extract in this trial did not reduce the risk of progression to Alzheimer's disease compared with placebo. FUNDING: Ipsen.

Ware Alzheimer Program at the University of Pennsylvania held a meeting entitled "State of the Science Conference on the Advancement of Alzheimer's Diagnosis, Treatment and Care," on June 21-22, 2012. The meeting comprised four workgroups focusing on Biomarkers; Clinical Care and Health Services Research; Drug Development; and Health Economics, Policy, and Ethics. The workgroups shared, discussed, and compiled an integrated set of priorities, recommendations, and action plans, which are presented in this article.

22959727|t|A touch screen-automated cognitive test battery reveals impaired attention, memory abnormalities, and increased response inhibition in the TgCRND8 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
22959727|a|Transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with abundant beta-amyloid develop memory impairments. However, multiple nonmnemonic cognitive domains such as attention and executive control are also compromised early in AD individuals, but have not been routinely assessed in animal models. Here, we assessed the cognitive abilities of TgCRND8 mice-a widely used model of beta-amyloid pathology-with a touch screen-based automated test battery. The test battery comprises highly translatable tests of multiple cognitive constructs impaired in human AD, such as memory, attention, and response control, as well as appropriate control tasks. We found that familial AD mutations affect not only memory, but also cause significant alterations of sustained attention and behavioral flexibility. Because changes in attention and response inhibition may affect performance on tests of other cognitive abilities including memory, our findings have important consequences for the assessment of disease mechanisms and therapeutics in animal models of AD. A more comprehensive phenotyping with specialized, multicomponent cognitive test batteries for mice might significantly advance translation from preclinical mouse studies to the clinic.

22961199|t|Generation of gene-targeted mice using embryonic stem cells derived from a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
22961199|a|Gene-targeting technology using mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells has become the "gold standard" for analyzing gene functions and producing disease models. Recently, genetically modified mice with multiple mutations have increasingly been produced to study the interaction between proteins and polygenic diseases. However, introduction of an additional mutation into mice already harboring several mutations by conventional natural crossbreeding is an extremely time- and labor-intensive process. Moreover, to do so in mice with a complex genetic background, several years may be required if the genetic background is to be retained. Establishing ES cells from multiple-mutant mice, or disease-model mice with a complex genetic background, would offer a possible solution. Here, we report the establishment and characterization of novel ES cell lines from a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (3xTg-AD mouse, Oddo et al. in Neuron 39:409-421, 2003) harboring 3 mutated genes (APPswe, TauP301L, and PS1M146V) and a complex genetic background. Thirty blastocysts were cultured and 15 stable ES cell lines (male: 11; female: 4) obtained. By injecting these ES cells into diploid or tetraploid blastocysts, we generated germline-competent chimeras. Subsequently, we confirmed that F1 mice derived from these animals showed similar biochemical and behavioral characteristics to the original 3xTg-AD mice. Furthermore, we introduced a gene-targeting vector into the ES cells and successfully obtained gene-targeted ES cells, which were then used to generate knockout mice for the targeted gene. These results suggest that the present methodology is effective for introducing an additional mutation into mice already harboring multiple mutated genes and/or a complex genetic background.

22961445|t|A European multicentre PET study of fibrillar amyloid in Alzheimer's disease.
22961445|a|PURPOSE: Amyloid PET tracers have been developed for in vivo detection of brain fibrillar amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's disease (AD). To serve as an early biomarker in AD the amyloid PET tracers need to be analysed in multicentre clinical studies. METHODS: In this study 238 [(11)C]Pittsburgh compound-B (PIB) datasets from five different European centres were pooled. Of these 238 datasets, 18 were excluded, leaving [(11)C]PIB datasets from 97 patients with clinically diagnosed AD (mean age 69 +- 8 years), 72 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; mean age 67.5 +- 8 years) and 51 healthy controls (mean age 67.4 +- 6 years) available for analysis. Of the MCI patients, 64 were longitudinally followed for 28 +- 15 months. Most participants (175 out of 220) were also tested for apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype. RESULTS: [(11)C]PIB retention in the neocortical and subcortical brain regions was significantly higher in AD patients than in age-matched controls. Intermediate [(11)C]PIB retention was observed in MCI patients, with a bimodal distribution (64 % MCI PIB-positive and 36 % MCI PIB-negative), which was significantly different the pattern in both the AD patients and controls. Higher [(11)C]PIB retention was observed in MCI ApoE epsilon4 carriers compared to non-ApoE epsilon4 carriers (p < 0.005). Of the MCI PIB-positive patients, 67 % had converted to AD at follow-up while none of the MCI PIB-negative patients converted. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the robustness of [(11)C]PIB PET as a marker of neocortical fibrillar amyloid deposition in brain when assessed in a multicentre setting. MCI PIB-positive patients showed more severe memory impairment than MCI PIB-negative patients and progressed to AD at an estimated rate of 25 % per year. None of the MCI PIB-negative patients converted to AD, and thus PIB negativity had a 100 % negative predictive value for progression to AD. This supports the notion that PIB-positive scans in MCI patients are an indicator of prodromal AD.

22964832|t|Investigation of c9orf72 in 4 neurodegenerative disorders.
22964832|a|OBJECTIVE To estimate the allele frequency of C9orf72 (G4C2) repeats in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), Alzheimer disease (AD), and Parkinson disease (PD). DESIGN The number of repeats was estimated by a 2-step genotyping strategy. For expansion carriers, we sequenced the repeat flanking regions and obtained APOE genotypes and MAPT H1/H2 haplotypes. SETTING Hospitals specializing in neurodegenerative disorders. SUBJECTS We analyzed 520 patients with FTLD, 389 patients with ALS, 424 patients with AD, 289 patients with PD, 602 controls, 18 families, and 29 patients with PD with the LRRK2 G2019S mutation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE The expansion frequency. RESULTS Based on a prior cutoff (>30 repeats), the expansion was detected in 9.3% of patients with ALS, 5.2% of patients with FTLD, and 0.7% of patients with PD but not in controls or patients with AD. It was significantly associated with family history of ALS or FTLD and age at onset of FTLD. Phenotype variation (ALS vs FTLD) was not associated with MAPT, APOE, or variability in the repeat flanking regions. Two patients with PD were carriers of 39 and 32 repeats with questionable pathological significance, since the 39-repeat allele does not segregate with PD. No expansion or intermediate alleles (20-29 repeats) were found among the G2019S carriers and AD cases with TAR DNA-binding protein 43-positive inclusions. Surprisingly, the frequency of the 10-repeat allele was marginally increased in all 4 neurodegenerative diseases compared with controls, indicating the presence of an unknown risk variation in the C9orf72 locus. CONCLUSIONS The C9orf72 expansion is a common cause of ALS and FTLD, but not of AD or PD. Our study raises concern about a reliable cutoff for the pathological repeat number, which is important in the utility of genetic screening.

22965126|t|Small RNA deep sequencing reveals a distinct miRNA signature released in exosomes from prion-infected neuronal cells.
22965126|a|Prion diseases are transmissible neurodegenerative disorders affecting both humans and animals. The cellular prion protein, PrP(C), and the abnormal infectious form, PrP(Sc), are found associated with exosomes, which are small 50-130 nm vesicles released from cells. Exosomes also contain microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of non-coding RNA, and have been utilized to identify miRNA signatures for diagnosis of disease. While some miRNAs are deregulated in prion-infected brain tissue, the role of miRNA in circulating exosomes released during prion disease is unknown. Here, we investigated the miRNA profile in exosomes released from prion-infected neuronal cells. We performed the first small RNA deep sequencing study of exosomes and demonstrated that neuronal exosomes contain a diverse range of RNA species including retroviral RNA repeat regions, messenger RNA fragments, transfer RNA fragments, non-coding RNA, small nuclear RNA, small nucleolar RNA, small cytoplasmic RNA, silencing RNA as well as known and novel candidate miRNA. Significantly, we show that exosomes released by prion-infected neuronal cells have increased let-7b, let-7i, miR-128a, miR-21, miR-222, miR-29b, miR-342-3p and miR-424 levels with decreased miR-146 a levels compared to non-infected exosomes. Overall, these results demonstrate that circulating exosomes released during prion infection have a distinct miRNA signature that can be utilized for diagnosis and understanding pathogenic mechanisms in prion disease.

22970285|t|Disturbed Ca2+ homeostasis increases glutaminyl cyclase expression; connecting two early pathogenic events in Alzheimer's disease in vitro.
22970285|a|A major neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the deposition of aggregated beta amyloid (Abeta) peptide in the senile plaques. Abeta is a peptide of 38-43 amino acids and its accumulation and aggregation plays a key role early in the disease. A large fraction of beta amyloid is N-terminally truncated rendering a glutamine that can subsequently be cyclized into pyroglutamate (pE). This makes the peptide more resistant to proteases, more prone to aggregation and increases its neurotoxicity. The enzyme glutaminyl cyclase (QC) catalyzes this conversion of glutamine to pE. In brains of AD patients, the expression of QC is increased in the earliest stages of pathology, which may be an important event in the pathogenesis. In this study we aimed to investigate the regulatory mechanism underlying the upregulation of QC expression in AD. Using differentiated SK-N-SH as a neuronal cell model, we found that neither the presence of Abeta peptides nor the unfolded protein response, two early events in AD, leads to increased QC levels. In contrast, we demonstrated increased QC mRNA levels and enzyme activity in response to another pathogenic factor in AD, perturbed intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis. The QC promoter contains a putative binding site for the Ca(2+) dependent transcription factors c-fos and c-jun. C-fos and c-jun are induced by the same Ca(2+)-related stimuli as QC and their upregulation precedes QC expression. We show that in the human brain QC is predominantly expressed by neurons. Interestingly, the Ca(2+)- dependent regulation of both c-fos and QC is not observed in non-neuronal cells. Our results indicate that perturbed Ca(2+) homeostasis results in upregulation of QC selectively in neuronal cells via Ca(2+)- dependent transcription factors. This suggests that disruption of Ca(2+) homeostasis may contribute to the formation of the neurotoxic pE Abeta peptides in Alzheimer's disease.

22974733|t|Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) supplementation prevents cognitive impairment and amyloid deposition in APP/PS1 mice.
22974733|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease hallmarked by extracellular Abeta(1-42) containing plaques, and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) containing hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Progressively, memory deficits and cognitive disabilities start to occur as these hallmarks affect hippocampus and frontal cortex, regions highly involved in memory. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) expression, which is high in the vicinity of Abeta plaques and NFTs, was found to influence gamma-secretase activity, the molecular crux in Abeta(1-42) production. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) is an endogenous bile acid that downregulates CTGF expression in hepatocytes and has been shown to possess therapeutic efficacy in neurodegenerative models. To investigate the possible in vivo therapeutic effects of TUDCA, we provided 0.4% TUDCA-supplemented food to APP/PS1 mice, a well-established AD mouse model. Six months of TUDCA supplementation prevented the spatial, recognition and contextual memory defects observed in APP/PS1 mice at 8 months of age. Furthermore, TUDCA-supplemented APP/PS1 mice displayed reduced hippocampal and prefrontal amyloid deposition. These effects of TUDCA supplementation suggest a novel mechanistic route for Alzheimer therapeutics.

22975281|t|How the amyloid-beta peptide and membranes affect each other: an extensive simulation study.
22975281|a|The etiology of Alzheimer's disease is thought to be linked to interactions between amyloid-beta (Abeta) and neural cell membranes, causing membrane disruption and increased ion conductance. The effects of Abeta on lipid behavior have been characterized experimentally, but structural and causal details are lacking. We used atomistic molecular dynamics simulations totaling over 6 mus in simulation time to investigate the behavior of Abeta(42) in zwitterionic and anionic lipid bilayers. We simulated transmembrane beta-sheets (monomer and tetramer) resulting from a global optimization study and a helical structure obtained from an NMR study. In all simulations Abeta(42) remained embedded in the bilayer. It was found that the surface charge and the lipid tail type are determinants for transmembrane stability of Abeta(42) with zwitterionic surfaces and unsaturated lipids promoting stability. From the considered structures, the beta-sheet tetramer is most stable as a result of interpeptide interactions. We performed an in-depth analysis of the translocation of water in the Abeta(42)-bilayer systems. We observed that this process is generally fast (within a few nanoseconds) yet generally slower than in the peptide-free bilayers. It is mainly governed by the lipid type, simulation temperature and Abeta(42) conformation. The rate limiting step is the permeation through the hydrophobic core, where interactions between Abeta(42) and permeating H(2)O molecules slow the translocation process. The beta-sheet tetramer allows more water molecules to pass through the bilayer compared to monomeric Abeta, allowing us to conclude that the experimentally observed permeabilization of membranes must be due to membrane-bound Abeta oligomers, and not monomers.

22975420|t|SUMO1 modulates Abeta generation via BACE1 accumulation.
22975420|a|Accumulation of disease-related proteins is a characteristic event observed in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. beta-secretase (BACE)-1, which initiates generation of beta-amyloid (Abeta), is increased in the Alzheimer's diseased brain. However, the mechanisms of BACE1 accumulation in Alzheimer's disease are largely unknown. In this report, we found that small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-1 interacts with the dileucine motif of BACE1 and regulates the level of BACE1 protein. This was proved by the coimmunoprecipitation, and gain or loss of function experiments. Altering 3 SUMO isoforms affects BACE1 protein levels, and consequently results in altered amyloid precursor protein processing and Abeta generation. BACE1 levels were increased in response to Abeta or apoptosis, but not in cells lacking SUMO1. Abeta increased SUMO1 protein levels in rat cortical neurons. Moreover, SUMO1 immunoreactivity was increased in the amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice. Furthermore, the C-terminus fragments of BACE1 containing dileucine motif reduced Abeta generation by SUMO1 overexpression. Our study indicates SUMO1 is not only a novel and potent regulator of BACE1 accumulation and Abeta generation but also a potential therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease.

22976325|t|Development of a new distyrylbenzene-derivative amyloid-beta-aggregation and fibril formation inhibitor.
22976325|a|Several new amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregation inhibitors were synthesized according to our theory that a hydrophilic moiety could be attached to the Abeta-recognition unit for the purpose of preventing amyloid plaque formation. A distyrylbenzene-derivative, DSB(EEX)(3), which consider the Abeta recognition unit (DSB, 1,4-distyrylbenzene) and expected to bind to amyloid fibrils (beta-sheet structure), was combined with the hydrophilic aggregation disrupting element (EEX) (E, Glu; X, 2-(2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy)acetic acid). This DSB(EEX)(3) compound, compared to several others synthesized similarly, was found to be the most active for reducing Abeta toxicity toward IMR-32 human neuroblastoma cells. Moreover, its inhibition of Abeta-aggregation or fibril formation was directly confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. These results suggest that the Abeta aggregation inhibitor DSB(EEX)(3) disrupts clumps of Abeta protein and is a likely candidate for drug development to treat Alzheimer's disease.

22982229|t|Large-scale production of soluble recombinant amyloid-beta peptide 1-42 using cold-inducible expression system.
22982229|a|Amyloid-beta peptide 1-42 (Abeta(1-42)), the predominant form in senile plaques, plays important roles in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Because Abeta(1-42) has aggregation-prone nature, it has been difficult to produce in a soluble state in bacterial expression systems. In this study, we modified our expression system to increase the soluble fraction of Abeta(1-42) in Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells. The expression level and solubility of recombinant Abeta(1-42) induced at the low temperature (16 C) is highly increased compared to that induced at 37 C. To optimize expression temperature, the coding region of Abeta(1-42) was constructed in a pCold vector, pCold-TF, which has a hexahistidine-tagged trigger factor (TF). Recombinant Abeta(1-42) was expressed primarily as a soluble protein using pCold vector system and purified with a nickel-chelating resin. When the toxic effect of recombinant Abeta(1-42) examined on human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, the purified Abeta(1-42) induced cell toxicity on SH-SY5Y cells. In conclusion, the system developed in this study will provide a useful method for the production of aggregation prone-peptide such as Abeta(1-42).

22982592|t|Gastrodin protect primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons against amyloid-beta peptide-induced neurotoxicity via ERK1/2-Nrf2 pathway.
22982592|a|One hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition, which can initiate a cascade of oxidative events that may result in neuronal death. The present study aimed to investigate the protective effects of gastrodin, a phenolic compound which shows antioxidant activity, on Abeta(1-42)-induced neurotoxicity and the underlying mechanism for this neuroprotection. Results indicate that Abeta(1-42)-induced neuronal toxicity as measured by cell viability, which was correlated with decreased catalase (CAT) content and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Pre-treatment of primary hippocampal neurons with gastrodin significantly attenuated Abeta(1-42)-induced neurotoxicity and changes in SOD and CAT, and upregulated gene expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation. Pharmacological blockade of ERK1/2 abrogation this action of gastrodin. The ERK1/2 pathway may be involved in the neuroprotective effect of gastrodin against Abeta(1-42)-induced oxidative in primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons. These findings suggest that gastrodin could be of importance for the treatment of AD and other oxidative stress-related diseases.

22983424|t|Highly potent VEGF-A-antagonistic DARPins as anti-angiogenic agents for topical and intravitreal applications.
22983424|a|The next-generation ophthalmic anti-VEGF therapeutics must aim at being superior to the currently available agents with regard to potency and improved drug delivery, while still being stable and safe to use at elevated concentrations. We show here the generation of a set of highly potent VEGF-A antagonistic DARPins (designed ankyrin repeat proteins) delivering these properties. DARPins with single-digit picomolar affinity to human VEGF-A were generated using ribosome display selections. Specific and potent human VEGF-A binding was confirmed by ELISA and endothelial cell sprouting assays. Cross-reactivity with VEGF-A of several species was confirmed by ELISA. Intravitreally injected DARPin penetrated into the retina and reduced fluorescein extravasation in a rabbit model of vascular leakage. In addition, topical DARPin application was found to diminish corneal neovascularization in a rabbit suture model, and to suppress laser-induced neovascularization in a rat model. Even at elevated doses, DARPins were safe to use. The fact that several DARPins are highly active in various assays illustrates the favorable class behavior of the selected binders. Anti-VEGF-A DARPins thus represent a novel class of highly potent and specific drug candidates for the treatment of neovascular eye diseases in both the posterior and the anterior eye chamber.

22985514|t|TGF-beta induced by interleukin-34-stimulated microglia regulates microglial proliferation and attenuates oligomeric amyloid beta neurotoxicity.
22985514|a|Microglia play critical roles in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have previously shown that interleukin-34 (IL-34) enhances microglial proliferation and induces microglial neuroprotective properties against oligomeric amyloid beta (oAbeta) toxicity by producing insulin degrading enzyme, an Abeta degrading enzyme, and anti-oxidant enzyme heme oxygenase-1. In this study, we found that IL-34 dose-dependently induces TGF-beta in microglia, and that TGF-beta attenuates oAbeta neurotoxicity in neuron microglial co-cultures. The TGF-beta 1 receptor kinase inhibitor SD208 enhances microglial proliferation by IL-34 and suppresses the neuroprotective effect of IL-34-treated microglia. These findings suggest that TGF-beta produced by IL-34-treated microglia is a negative regulator of microglial proliferation and enhances the neuroprotective property of microglia.

22987781|t|Characterization of plasma beta-secretase (BACE1) activity and soluble amyloid precursor proteins as potential biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease.
22987781|a|Reduction in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid beta42 (Abeta42) and elevation in total tau and phospho-thr181 tau consistently differentiate between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and age-matched control subjects. In contrast, CSF beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme activity (BACE1) and soluble amyloid precursor proteins alpha and beta (sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta) are without consistent patterns in AD subjects. Plasma sampling is much easier, with fewer side effects, and is readily applied in primary care centers, so we have developed and validated novel plasma BACE activity, sAPPbeta, and sAPPalpha assays and investigated their ability to distinguish AD from age-matched controls. Plasma BACE activity assay was sensitive and specific, with signal being immunodepleted with a specific BACE1 antibody and inhibited with a BACE1-specific inhibitor. Plasma sAPPbeta and sAPPalpha assays were specific, with signal diluting linearly, immunodepleted with specific antibodies, and at background levels in APP knockout mice. In rhesus monkeys, BACE1 but not gamma-secretase inhibitor led to significant lowering of plasma sAPPbeta with concurrent elevation of plasma sAPPalpha. AD subjects showed a significant increase in plasma BACE1 activity, sAPPbeta, sAPPalpha, and Abeta42 (P < 0.001) compared with age-matched controls. In conclusion, plasma BACE activity and sAPP endpoints provide novel investigative biomarkers for AD diagnosis and potential pharmacodynamic biomarkers for secretase inhibitor studies.

22988095|t|O-GlcNAc cycling mutants modulate proteotoxicity in Caenorhabditis elegans models of human neurodegenerative diseases.
22988095|a|O-GlcNAcylation is an abundant posttranslational modification in the brain implicated in human neurodegenerative diseases. We have exploited viable null alleles of the enzymes of O-GlcNAc cycling to examine the role of O-GlcNAcylation in well-characterized Caenorhabditis elegans models of neurodegenerative proteotoxicity. O-GlcNAc cycling dramatically modulated the severity of the phenotype in transgenic models of tauopathy, amyloid beta-peptide, and polyglutamine expansion. Intriguingly, loss of function of O-GlcNAc transferase alleviated, whereas loss of O-GlcNAcase enhanced, the phenotype of multiple neurodegenerative disease models. The O-GlcNAc cycling mutants act in part by altering DAF-16-dependent transcription and modulating the protein degradation machinery. These findings suggest that O-GlcNAc levels may directly influence neurodegenerative disease progression, thus making the enzymes of O-GlcNAc cycling attractive targets for neurodegenerative disease therapies.

22988240|t|beta-Site amyloid precursor protein (APP)-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1)-deficient mice exhibit a close homolog of L1 (CHL1) loss-of-function phenotype involving axon guidance defects.
22988240|a|BACE1 is the beta-secretase enzyme that initiates production of the beta-amyloid peptide involved in Alzheimer disease. However, little is known about the functions of BACE1. BACE1-deficient mice exhibit mild but complex neurological phenotypes suggesting therapeutic BACE1 inhibition may not be completely free of mechanism-based side effects. Recently, we have reported that BACE1 null mice have axon guidance defects in olfactory sensory neuron projections to glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. Here, we show that BACE1 deficiency also causes an axon guidance defect in the hippocampus, a shortened and disorganized infrapyramidal bundle of the mossy fiber projection from the dentate gyrus to CA3. Although we observed that a classical axon guidance molecule, EphA4, was cleaved by BACE1 when co-expressed with BACE1 in HEK293 cells, we could find no evidence of BACE1 processing of EphA4 in the brain. Remarkably, we discovered that the axon guidance defects of BACE1(-/-) mice were strikingly similar to those of mice deficient in a recently identified BACE1 substrate, the neural cell adhesion molecule close homolog of L1 (CHL1) that is involved in neurite outgrowth. CHL1 undergoes BACE1-dependent processing in BACE1(+/+), but not BACE1(-/-), hippocampus, and olfactory bulb, indicating that CHL1 is a BACE1 substrate in vivo. Finally, BACE1 and CHL1 co-localize in the terminals of hippocampal mossy fibers, olfactory sensory neuron axons, and growth cones of primary hippocampal neurons. We conclude that BACE1(-/-) axon guidance defects are likely the result of abrogated BACE1 processing of CHL1 and that BACE1 deficiency produces a CHL1 loss-of-function phenotype. Our results imply the possibility that axon mis-targeting may occur in adult neurogenic and/or regenerating neurons as a result of chronic BACE1 inhibition and add a note of caution to BACE1 inhibitor development.

22992745|t|Molecular plasticity regulates oligomerization and cytotoxicity of the multipeptide-length amyloid-beta peptide pool.
22992745|a|Current therapeutic approaches under development for Alzheimer disease, including gamma-secretase modulating therapy, aim at increasing the production of Abeta(1-38) and Abeta(1-40) at the cost of longer Abeta peptides. Here, we consider the aggregation of Abeta(1-38) and Abeta(1-43) in addition to Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42), in particular their behavior in mixtures representing the complex in vivo Abeta pool. We demonstrate that Abeta(1-38) and Abeta(1-43) aggregate similar to Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42), respectively, but display a variation in the kinetics of assembly and toxicity due to differences in short timescale conformational plasticity. In biologically relevant mixtures of Abeta, Abeta(1-38) and Abeta(1-43) significantly affect the behaviors of Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42). The short timescale conformational flexibility of Abeta(1-38) is suggested to be responsible for enhancing toxicity of Abeta(1-40) while exerting a cyto-protective effect on Abeta(1-42). Our results indicate that the complex in vivo Abeta peptide array and variations thereof is critical in Alzheimer disease, which can influence the selection of current and new therapeutic strategies.

22992957|t|Pancortins interact with amyloid precursor protein and modulate cortical cell migration.
22992957|a|Neuronal precursor cell migration in the developing mammalian brain is a complex process requiring the coordinated interaction of numerous proteins. We have recently shown that amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays a role in migration into the cortical plate through its interaction with two cytosolic signaling proteins, disabled 1 (DAB1) and disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1). In order to identify extracellular factors that may signal through APP to regulate migration, we performed an unbiased mass spectrometry-based screen for factors that bind to the extracellular domain of APP in the rodent brain. Through this screen, we identified an interaction between APP and pancortins, proteins expressed throughout the developing and mature cerebral cortex. Via co-immunoprecipitation, we show that APP interacts with all four of the mammalian pancortin isoforms (AMY, AMZ, BMY, BMZ). We demonstrate that the BMZ and BMY isoforms of pancortin can specifically reduce beta-secretase- but not alpha-secretase-mediated cleavage of endogenous APP in cell culture, suggesting a biochemical consequence of the association between pancortins and APP. Using in utero electroporation to overexpress and knock down specific pancortin isoforms, we reveal a novel role for pancortins in migration into the cortical plate. Interestingly, we observe opposing roles for alternate pancortin isoforms, with AMY overexpression and BMZ knock down both preventing proper migration of neuronal precursor cells. Finally, we show that BMZ can partially rescue a loss of APP expression and that APP can rescue effects of AMY overexpression, suggesting that pancortins act in conjunction with APP to regulate entry into the cortical plate. Taken together, these results suggest a biochemical and functional interaction between APP and pancortins, and reveal a previously unidentified role for pancortins in mammalian cortical development.

22993429|t|Abca1 deficiency affects Alzheimer's disease-like phenotype in human ApoE4 but not in ApoE3-targeted replacement mice.
22993429|a|ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) transporter regulates cholesterol efflux and is an essential mediator of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) formation. In amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice, Abca1 deficiency increased amyloid deposition in the brain paralleled by decreased levels of Apolipoprotein E (ApoE). The APOEepsilon4 allele is the major genetic risk factor of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we reveal the effect of Abca1 deficiency on phenotype in mice expressing human ApoE3 or ApoE4. We used APP/E3 and APP/E4 mice generated by crossing APP/PS1DeltaE9 transgenic mice to human APOE3- and APOE4-targeted replacement mice and examined Abca1 gene dose effect on amyloid deposition and cognition. The results from two behavior tests demonstrate that lack of one copy of Abca1 significantly exacerbates memory deficits in APP/E4/Abca1(-/+) but not in APP/E3/Abca1(-/+) mice. The data for amyloid plaques and insoluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) also show that Abca1 hemizygosity increases Abeta deposition only in APP/E4/Abca1(-/+) but not in APP/E3/Abca1(-/+) mice. Our in vivo microdialysis assays indicate that Abca1 deficiency significantly decreases Abeta clearance in ApoE4-expressing mice, while the effect of Abca1 on Abeta clearance in ApoE3-expressing mice was insignificant. In addition, we demonstrate that plasma HDL and Abeta42 levels in APP/E4/Abca1(-/+) mice are significantly decreased, and there is a negative correlation between plasma HDL and amyloid plaques in brain, suggesting that plasma lipoproteins may be involved in Abeta clearance. Overall, our results prove that the presence of functional Abca1 significantly influences the phenotype of APP mice expressing human ApoE4 and further substantiate therapeutic approaches in AD based on ABCA1-APOE regulatory axis.

Based on MRI findings, Initial corticosteroid therapy with beta methasone effectively improved the neurological symptoms of consciousness disturbance and motor deficits. After corticosteroid therapy was stopped at 4 weeks, recurrence occurred. Additional corticosteroids did not improve clinical symptoms and the patient progressed to a bed-ridden state with a severe consciousness disturbance. Notably, CSF Abeta1-42 and CSF Abeta1-40 decreased while the recurrent encephalopathy worsened. After intense deterioration, the patient became stable. CSF Abeta1-42 increased but remained at a very low level. This case of CAA encephalopathy with apolipoprotein E epsilon4/epsilon4 homozygosity showed Abeta deposits in vascular walls and numerous diffuse plaques in parenchymal areas. The clinical course suggests that reduction of CSF Abeta1-42 and Abeta1-40 might be related to clinical deterioration in cases of encephalopathy.

22995388|t|Anthocyanin-enriched bilberry and blackcurrant extracts modulate amyloid precursor protein processing and alleviate behavioral abnormalities in the APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
22995388|a|A growing body of epidemiological evidence suggests that fruit and vegetable juices containing various phenolic compounds can reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As the altered amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing leading to increased beta-amyloid (Abeta) production is a key pathogenic feature of AD, we elucidated the effects of different polyphenols on neuroprotection and APP processing under different in vitro stress conditions. The effects of these compounds were also investigated in transgenic AD mice (APdE9). Free radical toxicity and apoptosis were induced in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells overexpressing APP751. Menadione-induced production of reactive oxygen species was significantly decreased upon treatment with myricetin, quercetin or anthocyanin-rich extracts in a dose-dependent manner. However, these extracts did not affect caspase-3 activation, APP processing or Abeta levels upon staurosporine-induced apoptosis. APdE9 mice fed with anthocyanin-rich bilberry or blackcurrant extracts showed decreased APP C-terminal fragment levels in the cerebral cortex as compared to APdE9 mice on the control diet. Soluble Abeta40 and Abeta42 levels were significantly decreased in bilberry-fed mice as compared to blackcurrant-fed mice. Conversely, the ratio of insoluble Abeta42/40 was significantly decreased in blackcurrant-fed mice relative to bilberry-fed mice. Both berry diets alleviated the spatial working memory deficit of aged APdE9 mice as compared to mice on the control diet. There were no changes in the expression or phosphorylation status of tau in APdE9 mice with respect to diet. These data suggest that anthocyanin-rich bilberry and blackcurrant diets favorably modulate APP processing and alleviate behavioral abnormalities in a mouse model of AD.

22996674|t|Neurodegeneration, beta-amyloid and mood disorders: state of the art and future perspectives.
22996674|a|OBJECTIVE: Depression may increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies have shown modifications in blood beta-amyloid (Abeta) levels in depressed patients. This literature review examines the potential relationship between Abeta-mediated neurotoxicity and pathophysiology of mood disorders. DESIGN: We conducted a review of the literature focusing on recent studies reporting alterations of plasma and serum Abeta peptides levels in patients suffering from mood disorders. RESULTS: Different data suggest that patients with mood disorders are at great risk of developing cognitive impairment and dementia. In particular, low plasma levels of Abeta42 peptide and a high Abeta40/Abeta42 ratio have been found in depressed patients. In addition, changes in Abeta protein levels in patients with mood disorders have been associated with the severity of cognitive impairment and correlated positively with the number of episodes and severity of illness course. CONCLUSIONS: Given the intriguing association between change in plasma level of Abeta, depression and cognitive impairment, future work should focus on the relationship between Abeta peripheral level(s), biomarkers of neurodegeneration and development of dementia in patients affected by mood disorders.

22996751|t|beta-Amyloid induced effects on cholinergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic neurons is differentially counteracted by anti-inflammatory drugs.
22996751|a|beta-Amyloid (Abeta) is a small peptide that plays a potent role in synaptic plasticity as well as forms amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies suggest that Abeta deposition is deleterious not only in AD, but also in Parkinson's disease (PD) and depression. This Abeta effect is associated with inflammatory processes. However, further evaluation is needed to understand how Abeta and inflammation interact and contribute to the regulation of the cholinergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic neuronal populations. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of Abeta(1-42) on cholinergic neurons of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (which degenerate in AD), on serotonergic neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus (which play a role in depression), and on dopaminergic neurons of the ventral mesencephalon (which degenerate in PD) in rat organotypic brain slices. Furthermore, we investigated whether anti-inflammatory drugs (celecoxib, citalopram, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, ibuprofen, indomethacin, piclamilast) modulate or counteract Abeta-induced effects. Two-week-old organotypic brain slices of the nucleus basalis of Meynert, dorsal raphe nucleus, and ventral mesencephalon were incubated with 50 ng/ml Abeta(1-42) with or without anti-inflammatory agents for 3 days. Our results reveal that Abeta significantly decreased the number of choline acetyltransferase-positive cholinergic, tryptophan hydroxylase-positive serotonergic, and tyrosine hydroxylase-positive dopaminergic neurons and that anti-inflammatory drugs partially counteracted the Abeta-induced neuronal decline. This decline was not due to apoptotic processes (as evaluated by TUNEL, propidium iodide, caspase), oxidative stress (as measured by nitrite, catalase, or superoxide dismutase-2), or inflammation, but was most likely caused by a downregulation of these key enzymes.

22996963|t|Localization of cholesterol, amyloid and glia in Alzheimer's disease transgenic mouse brain tissue using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and immunofluorescence imaging.
22996963|a|The spatial distributions of lipids, amyloid-beta deposits, markers of neurons and glial cells were imaged, at submicrometer lateral resolution, in brain structures of a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease using a new methodology that combines time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and confocal fluorescence microscopy. The technology, which enabled us to simultaneously image the lipid and glial cell distributions in Tg2576 mouse brain structures, revealed micrometer-sized cholesterol accumulations in hippocampal regions undergoing amyloid-beta deposition. Such cholesterol granules were either associated with individual amyloid deposits or spread over entire regions undergoing amyloidogenesis. Subsequent immunohistochemical analysis of the same brain regions showed increased microglial and astrocytic immunoreactivity associated with the amyloid deposits, as expected from previous studies, but did not reveal any particular astrocytic or microglial feature correlated with cholesterol granulation. However, dystrophic neurites as well as presynaptic vesicles presented a distribution similar to that of cholesterol granules in regions undergoing amyloid-beta accumulation, thus indicating that these neuronal endpoints may retain cholesterol in areas with lesions. In conclusion, the present study provides evidence for an altered cholesterol distribution near amyloid deposits that would have been missed by several other lipid analysis methods, and opens for the possibility to study in detail the putative liaison between lipid environment and protein structure and function in Alzheimer's disease.

22997326|t|Preventing Alzheimer's disease.
22997326|a|Despite intensive laboratory and clinical research over three decades, an effective treatment to delay the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease is not at hand. Recent clinical trial failures suggest that we must treat the disease earlier than in its mild to moderate stages, and major progress in validating presymptomatic biomarkers now makes secondary prevention trials possible. We will learn more about the natural history of the disease and any partial therapeutic responses from detailed analyses of recent trial results. This process will likely position the field for success, but only with much greater investment in all aspects of Alzheimer research and with careful design of future trials.

22998035|t|Secretory sorting receptors carboxypeptidase E and secretogranin III in amyloid beta-associated neural degeneration in Alzheimer's disease.
22998035|a|The secretory sorting receptors carboxypeptidase E (CPE) and secretogranin III (SgIII) critically activate peptidic messengers and targeting them at the regulated secretory pathway. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the wide range of changes includes impaired function of key secretory peptidic cargos such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neuropeptides. Here, we analyzed CPE and SgIII in the cerebral cortex of AD patients and transgenic mice. In the normal human cortex, a preferential location in dendrites and perikarya was observed for CPE, whereas SgIII was mainly associated with axons and terminal-like buttons. Interestingly, SgIII and CPE were consistently detected in astroglial cell bodies and thin processes. In AD cortices, a strong wide accumulation of both sorting receptors was detected in dystrophic neurites surrounding amyloid plaques. Occasionally, increased levels of SgIII were also observed in plaque associate-reactive astrocytes. Of note, the main alterations detected for CPE and SgIII in AD patients were faithfully recapitulated by APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. These results implicate for the first time the sorting receptors for regulated secretion in amyloid beta-associated neural degeneration. Because CPE and SgIII are essential in the process and targeting of neuropeptides and neurotrophins, their participation in the pathological progression of AD may be suggested.

23001756|t|Structural analysis of the pyroglutamate-modified isoform of the Alzheimer's disease-related amyloid-beta using NMR spectroscopy.
23001756|a|The aggregation of the Abeta plays a fundamental role in the pathology of AD. Recently, N-terminally modified Abeta species, pE-Abeta, have been described as major constituents of Abeta deposits in the brains of AD patients. pE-Abeta has an increased aggregation propensity and shows increased toxicity compared with Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42. In the present work, high-resolution NMR spectroscopy was performed to study pE-Abeta3-40 in aqueous TFE-containing solution. Two-dimensional TOCSY and NOESY experiments were performed. On the basis of NOE and chemical shift data, pE-Abeta3-40 was shown to contain two helical regions formed by residues 14-22 and 30-36. This is similar as previously described for Abeta1-40. However, the secondary chemical shift data indicate decreased helical propensity in pE-Abeta3-40 when compared with Abeta1-40 under exactly the same conditions. This is in agreement with the observation that pE-Abeta3-40 shows a drastically increased tendency to form beta-sheet-rich structures under more physiologic conditions. Structural studies of pE-Abeta are crucial for better understanding the structural basis of amyloid fibril formation in the brain during development of AD, especially because an increasing number of reports indicate a decisive role of pE-Abeta for the pathogenesis of AD.

23006895|t|Elevated plasma homocysteine level is not primarily related to Alzheimer's disease.
23006895|a|BACKGROUND: A moderate elevation of plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) is considered a potential risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: We have investigated the main determinants (age, renal impairment, cobalamin/folate status and the presence of vascular disease) of plasma tHcy in 326 patients with AD, and also in 281 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), since about half of these patients develop AD during the first 5 years. RESULTS: Elevated plasma tHcy in patients with AD could mainly be attributed to cobalamin/folate deficiency or renal impairment. Younger patients (below 75 years) with AD and patients with MCI without cobalamin/folate deficiency or renal impairment showed normal levels of plasma tHcy. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that plasma tHcy is not primarily involved in the pathogenesis of AD but rather a reflection of changes of the main determinants of plasma tHcy in AD patients.

23008501|t|Preclinical characterization of a novel class of 18F-labeled PET tracers for amyloid-beta.
23008501|a|UNLABELLED: Imaging of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques by PET is more and more integrated into concepts for Alzheimer disease (AD) diagnosis and drug development. The objective of this study was to find novel chemical entities that can be transformed into (18)F-labeled Abeta tracers with favorable brain washout kinetics and low background signal. METHODS: High-throughput screening of a large chemical library was used to identify new ligands for fibrillar aggregates of Abeta(1-42) peptide. Thirty-two fluorinated derivatives were synthesized and tested for their affinity toward AD brain homogenate. Twelve ligands have been radiolabeled with (18)F. The pharmacokinetic properties of the radioligands were investigated in mouse and monkey biodistribution studies. Binding characteristics were determined by autoradiography of AD brain sections in vitro and using amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice in vivo. RESULTS: The systematic search for Abeta imaging agents revealed several fluorinated derivatives with nanomolar affinity for Abeta. The fluoropyridyl derivative BAY 1008472 showed a high initial brain uptake (6.45 percentage injected dose per gram at 2 min) and rapid brain washout (ratio of percentage of injected dose per gram of tissue at 2 and 30 min after injection, 9.2) in mice. PET studies of healthy rhesus monkeys confirmed the high initial brain uptake of BAY 1008472 (2.52 standardized uptake value at peak) and a fast elimination of total radioactivity from gray and white matter areas (ratio of standardized uptake value at peak uptake and 60 min 11.0). In autoradiographic analysis, BAY 1008472 selectively detected Abeta deposits in human AD brain sections with high contrast and did not bind to tau- or alpha-synuclein pathologies. Finally, ex vivo autoradiography of brain sections from amyloid precursor protein-transgenic mice confirmed that BAY 1008472 is indeed suitable for the in vivo detection of Abeta plaques. CONCLUSION: A new chemical class of Abeta tracers has been identified by high-throughput screening. The fluoropyridyl derivative BAY 1008472 shows a favorable preclinical profile including low background binding in gray and white matter. These properties might qualify this new tracer, in particular, to detect subtle amounts or changes of Abeta burden in presymptomatic AD and during therapy.

23009396|t|GM1 cluster mediates formation of toxic Abeta fibrils by providing hydrophobic environments.
23009396|a|The conversion of soluble, nontoxic amyloid beta-proteins (Abeta) to aggregated, toxic forms rich in beta-sheets is considered to be a key step in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Accumulating evidence suggests that lipid-protein interactions play a crucial role in the aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins like Abeta. Our group has previously reported that amyloid fibrils of Abeta formed on membranes containing clusters of GM1 ganglioside (M-fibrils) exhibit greater cytotoxicity than fibrils formed in aqueous solution (W-fibrils) [    Okada       (  2008  )   J. Mol. Biol.  382  ,   1066 - 1074  ]. W-fibrils are considered to consist of in-register parallel beta-sheets. However, the precise molecular structure of M-fibrils and force driving the formation of toxic fibrils remain unclear. In this study, we hypothesized that low-polarity environments provided by GM1 clusters drive the formation of toxic fibrils and compared the structure and cytotoxicity of W-fibrils, M-fibrils, and aggregates formed in a low-polarity solution mimicking membrane environments. First, we determined solvent conditions which mimic the polarity of raftlike membranes using Abeta-(1-40) labeled with the 7-diethylaminocoumarin-3-carbonyl dye. The polarity of a mixture of 80% 1,4-dioxane and 20% water (v/v) was found to be close to that of raftlike membranes. Abeta-(1-40) formed amyloid fibrils within several hours in 80% dioxane (D-fibrils) or in the presence of raftlike membranes, whereas a much longer incubation time was required for fibril formation in a conventional buffer. D-fibrils were morphologically similar to M-fibrils. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy suggested that M-fibrils and D-fibrils contained antiparallel beta-sheets. These fibrils had greater surface hydrophobicity and exhibited significant toxicity against human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, whereas W-fibrils with less surface hydrophobicity were not cytotoxic. We concluded that ganglioside clusters mediate the formation of toxic amyloid fibrils of Abeta with an antiparallel beta-sheet structure by providing less polar environments.

23010326|t|Dual role of Cu2+ ions on the aggregation and degradation of soluble Abeta oligomers and protofibrils investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy and AFM.
23010326|a|The neuropathological character of copper(II) ions (Cu(2+)) upon interaction with soluble human amyloid-beta(1-42) that subsequently generates senile plaques and/or reactive oxygen species (ROS) is considered as one of the very important features of Alzheimer's disease. The present study carried out by using fluorescence spectroscopy and atomic-force microscopy (AFM) indeed confirms the dual role played by Cu(2+), namely as mediator of protein aggregation and as generator of ROS leading to irreversible protein alteration, which most likely involve two distinct copper-binding sites. The AFM investigations clearly evidence the copper-induced aggregation of Abeta oligomers and protofibrils, while comparative fluorescence measurements with copper and zinc reveals the crucial involvement of redox-active copper in the generation of Abeta-cross-linked structures.

23015319|t|Amyloid beta-protein suppressed nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-mediated currents in acutely isolated rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.
23015319|a|Amyloid beta protein (Abeta) is responsible for the deficits of learning and memory in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The high affinity between Abeta and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) suggests that the impairment of cognitive function in AD might be involved in the Abeta-induced damage of nAChRs. This study investigated the effects of Abeta fragments on nAChR-mediated membrane currents in acutely isolated rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons by using whole-cell patch clamp technique. The results showed that: (1) nonspecific nAChR agonist nicotine, selective alpha7 nAChR agonist choline, and alpha4beta2 nAChR agonist epibatidine all effectively evoked inward currents in CA1 neurons at normal resting membrane potential, with different desensitization characteristics; (2) acute application of different concentrations (pM-muM) of Abeta25-35, Abeta31-35, or Abeta35-31 alone did not trigger any membrane current, but pretreatment with 1 muM Abeta25-35 and Abeta31-35 similarly and reversibly suppressed the nicotine-induced currents; (3) further, choline- and epibatidine-induced currents were also reversibly suppressed by the Abeta pretreatment, but more prominent for the choline-induced response. These results demonstrate that the functional activity of both alpha7 and alpha4beta2 nAChRs in the membrane of acutely isolated hippocampal neurons was significantly downregulated by Abeta treatment, suggesting that nAChRs, especially alpha7 nAChRs, in the brain may be the important biological targets of neurotoxic Abeta in AD. In addition, the similar suppression of nAChR currents by Abeta25-35 and Abeta31-35 suggests that the sequence 31-35 in Abeta molecule may be a shorter active center responsible for the neurotoxicity of Abeta in AD.

23016872|t|Ionic strength effects on amyloid formation by amylin are a complicated interplay among Debye screening, ion selectivity, and Hofmeister effects.
23016872|a|Amyloid formation plays a role in a wide range of human diseases. The rate and extent of amyloid formation depend on solution conditions, including pH and ionic strength. Amyloid fibrils often adopt structures with parallel, in-register beta-sheets, which generate quasi-infinite arrays of aligned side chains. These arrangements can lead to significant electrostatic interactions between adjacent polypeptide chains. The effect of ionic strength and ion composition on the kinetics of amyloid formation by islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) is examined. IAPP is a basic 37-residue polypeptide responsible for islet amyloid formation in type 2 diabetes. Poisson-Boltzmann calculations revealed significant electrostatic repulsion in a model of the IAPP fibrillar state. The kinetics of IAPP amyloid formation are strongly dependent on ionic strength, varying by a factor of >10 over the range of 20-600 mM NaCl at pH 8.0, but the effect is not entirely due to Debye screening. At low ionic strengths, the rate depends strongly on the identity of the anion, varying by a factor of nearly 4, and scales with the electroselectivity series, implicating anion binding. At high ionic strengths, the rate varies by only 8% and scales with the Hofmeister series. At intermediate ionic strengths, no clear trend is detected, likely because of the convolution of different effects. The effects of salts on the growth phase and lag phase of IAPP amyloid formation are strongly correlated. At pH 5.5, where the net charge on IAPP is higher, the effect of different anions scales with the electroselectivity series at all salt concentrations.

23016931|t|Nitric oxide-mediated regulation of beta-amyloid clearance via alterations of MMP-9/TIMP-1.
23016931|a|Fibrillar amyloid plaques are largely composed of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides that are metabolized into products, including Abeta1-16, by proteases including matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9). The balance between production and degradation of Abeta proteins is critical to amyloid accumulation and resulting disease. Regulation of MMP-9 and its endogenous inhibitor tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 by nitric oxide (NO) has been shown. We hypothesize that nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) protects against Alzheimer's disease pathology by increasing amyloid clearance through NO regulation of MMP-9/TIMP-1 balance. We show NO-mediated increased MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratios enhanced the degradation of fibrillar Abeta in vitro, which was abolished when silenced for MMP-9 protein translation. The in vivo relationship between MMP-9, NO and Abeta degradation was examined by comparing an Alzheimer's disease mouse model that expresses NOS2 with a model lacking NOS2. To quantitate MMP-9 mediated changes, we generated an antibody recognizing the Abeta1-16 fragment, and used mass spectrometry multi-reaction monitoring assay for detection of immunoprecipitated Abeta1-16 peptides. Abeta1-16 levels decreased in brain lysates lacking NOS2 when compared with strains that express human amyloid precursor protein on the NOS2 background. TIMP-1 increased in the APPSwDI/NOS2(-/-)  mice with decreased MMP activity and increased amyloid burden, thereby supporting roles for NO in the regulation of MMP/TIMP balance and plaque clearance.

23017051|t|New aminoimidazoles as beta-secretase (BACE-1) inhibitors showing amyloid-beta (Abeta) lowering in brain.
23017051|a|Amino-2H-imidazoles are described as a new class of BACE-1 inhibitors for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Synthetic methods, crystal structures, and structure-activity relationships for target activity, permeability, and hERG activity are reported and discussed. Compound (S)-1m was one of the most promising compounds in this report, with high potency in the cellular assay and a good overall profile. When guinea pigs were treated with compound (S)-1m, a concentration and time dependent decrease in Abeta40 and Abeta42 levels in plasma, brain, and CSF was observed. The maximum reduction of brain Abeta was 40-50%, 1.5 h after oral dosing (100 mumol/kg). The results presented highlight the potential of this new class of BACE-1 inhibitors with good target potency and with low effect on hERG, in combination with a fair CNS exposure in vivo.

23019586|t|Epidermal growth factor receptor is a preferred target for treating amyloid-beta-induced memory loss.
23019586|a|Current understanding of amyloid-beta (Abeta) metabolism and toxicity provides an extensive list of potential targets for developing drugs for treating Alzheimer's disease. We took two independent approaches, including synaptic-plasticity-based analysis and behavioral screening of synthetic compounds, for identifying single compounds that are capable of rescuing the Abeta-induced memory loss in both transgenic fruit fly and transgenic mouse models. Two clinically available drugs and three synthetic compounds not only showed positive effects in behavioral tests but also antagonized the Abeta oligomers-induced activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Such surprising converging outcomes from two parallel approaches lead us to conclude that EGFR is a preferred target for treating Abeta-induced memory loss.

23020188|t|gamma-secretase inhibitors prevent overgrowth of transplanted neural progenitors derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells.
23020188|a|Although transplanted pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons can contribute to functional recovery in animal models of Parkinson's disease, the risk of tumor formation hinders clinical applications of this approach. Removing undifferentiated cells from the donor population is critical to reduce tumorigenesis. Moreover, immature neural progenitors in transplants can proliferate unpredictably, resulting in neural overgrowth and long-term risks of compressing the surrounding host tissue. Because Notch signaling plays a role in maintaining the multipotency and proliferative capacity of neural progenitors, we used gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) to dampen Notch signaling in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitors before transplantation and examined the effects on the growth of proliferative grafts. We observed a marked reduction in the percentage of dividing cells and increased neuronal maturation in GSI-treated samples in vitro. Next, grafts were transplanted into the striata of nonobese diabetic/severe combined immune deficiency mice. Histological analyses performed 8 weeks after the operation showed that grafts pretreated with GSIs--N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester or compound E--were significantly smaller than control samples. Immunohistologic analyses revealed that briefly treating the donor population with GSIs not only reduced the graft volume, but also altered the composition of the graft; control grafts showed neural overgrowth with numerous PAX6+ and Ki67+ neural rosettes, whereas GSI-treated samples developed into mature neuronal grafts containing primarily Tubbeta3+ cells. These results suggest that pretreating potentially proliferative progenitors with GSIs may improve the safety of cell replacement therapies using pluripotent stem cells.

23020770|t|Asp664 cleavage of amyloid precursor protein induces tau phosphorylation by decreasing protein phosphatase 2A activity.
23020770|a|Caspase cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been reported to be important in amyloid beta protein (Abeta)-mediated neurotoxicity. However, the underlying mechanisms are not clearly understood. In this study, we explored the effect of caspase cleavage of APP on tau phosphorylation in relation to Abeta. We found that Asp664 cleavage of APP increased tau phosphorylation at Thr212 and Ser262 in N2A cells and primary cultured hippocampal neurons. Compared with wild-type APP, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity was significantly increased when Asp664 cleavage was blocked by the D664A point mutation. Furthermore, we found that over-expression of C31 reduced PP2A activity. C31 binds directly to the PP2A catalytic subunit, through the asparagine, proline, threonine, tyrosine (NPTY) motif, which is essential for C31-induced tau hyperphosphorylation. However, it appears that the other fragment produced by Asp664 cleavage, Jcasp, modulates neither PP2A activity nor tau hyperphosphorylation. Asp664 cleavage and accompanying tau hyperphosphorylation were remarkably diminished by blockage of Abeta production using a gamma-secretase inhibitor. Taken together, our results suggest that Asp664 cleavage of APP leads to tau hyperphosphorylation at specific epitopes by modulating PP2A activity as a downstream of Abeta. Direct binding of C31 to PP2A through the C31-NPTY domain was identified as a mechanism underlying this effect.

23022323|t|Modeling the binding mechanism of Alzheimer's Abeta1-42 to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors based on similarity with snake alpha-neurotoxins.
23022323|a|For over a decade, it has been known that amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides of Alzheimer's disease bind to the nicotinic alpha7 acetylcholine receptor (AChR) with picomolar affinity, and that snake alpha-neurotoxins competitively inhibit this binding. Here we propose a model of the binding mechanism of Abeta peptides to alpha7-AChR at atomic level. The binding mechanism is based on sequence and structure similarities of Abeta residues with functional residues of snake alpha-neurotoxins (ATX) in complex with AChR. The binding mechanism involves residue (Abeta)K28 (similar to (ATX)R32) which forms cation/pi interactions in the acetylcholine binding site, and residues (Abeta)G29-(Abeta)I32 [GAII] (similar to (ATX)G33-(ATX)I36 [GTII]) which form an intermolecular beta-sheet with residues (alpha7)F189-(alpha7)E191 of AChR. Through these interactions, we propose that the AChR serves as a chaperone for Abeta conformational changes from alpha- to beta-hairpin. The interactions which block channel opening provide fundamental insight into Abeta neurotoxicity and cognition impairment, that could contribute to pathogenic processes in Alzheimer's disease, thus paving the way for structure based therapies.

23022416|t|Effect of complement CR1 on brain amyloid burden during aging and its modification by APOE genotype.
23022416|a|BACKGROUND: The rs3818361 single nucleotide polymorphism in complement component (3b/4b) receptor-1 (CR1) is associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although this novel variant is associated with a small effect size and is unlikely to be useful as a predictor of AD risk, it might provide insights into AD pathogenesis. We examined the association between rs3818361 and brain amyloid deposition in nondemented older individuals. METHODS: We used (11)C-Pittsburgh Compound-B positron emission tomography to quantify brain amyloid burden in 57 nondemented older individuals (mean age 78.5 years) in the neuroimaging substudy of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. In a replication study, we analyzed (11)C-Pittsburgh Compound-B positron emission tomography data from 22 cognitively normal older individuals (mean age 77.1 years) in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset. RESULTS: Risk allele carriers of rs3818361 have lower brain amyloid burden relative to noncarriers. There is a strikingly greater variability in brain amyloid deposition in the noncarrier group relative to risk carriers, an effect explained partly by APOE genotype. In noncarriers of the CR1 risk allele, APOE epsilon4 individuals showed significantly higher brain amyloid burden relative to APOE epsilon4 noncarriers. We also independently replicate our observation of lower brain amyloid burden in risk allele carriers of rs3818361 in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative sample. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest complex mechanisms underlying the interaction of CR1, APOE, and brain amyloid pathways in AD. Our results are relevant to treatments targeting brain Abeta in nondemented individuals at risk for AD and suggest that clinical outcomes of such treatments might be influenced by complex gene-gene interactions.

23022919|t|Environmental enrichment prevents astroglial pathological changes in the hippocampus of APP transgenic mice, model of Alzheimer's disease.
23022919|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects neurons and glial cells and leads to dementia. Growing evidence shows that glial changes may precede neuronal alterations and behavioral impairment in the progression of the disease. The modulation of these changes could be addressed as a potential therapeutic strategy. Environmental enrichment has been classically associated to effects on neuronal morphology and function but less attention has been paid to the modulation of glia. We thus characterized astroglial changes in the hippocampus of adult PDAPP-J20 transgenic mice, a model of AD, exposed for 3 months to an enriched environment, from 5 to 8 months of age. Using confocal microscopy, three-dimensional reconstruction and Sholl analysis, we evaluated the morphology of two distinct populations of astrocytes: those associated to amyloid beta plaques and those that were not. We found that plaque-associated astrocytes in PDAPP-J20 mice had an increased volume and process ramification than control astrocytes. Non-plaque-associated astrocytes showed a decrease in volume and an increase in the ramification of GFAP+ processes as compared with control astrocytes. Environmental enrichment prevented these alterations and promoted a cellular morphology similar to that found in control mice. Morphological changes in non-plaque-associated astrocytes were found also at 5 months of age, before amyloid beta deposition in the hippocampus. These results suggest that glial alterations have an early onset in AD pathogenesis and that the exposure to an enriched environment is an appropriate strategy to reverse them. Cellular and molecular pathways involved in this regulation could constitute potential novel therapeutic targets.

23024364|t|Cathepsin B degrades amyloid-beta in mice expressing wild-type human amyloid precursor protein.
23024364|a|Accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta), believed to be a key trigger of Alzheimer disease (AD), could result from impaired clearance mechanisms. Previously, we showed that the cysteine protease cathepsin B (CatB) degrades Abeta, most likely by C-terminal truncation, in mice expressing human amyloid precursor protein with familial AD-linked mutations (hAPP(FAD)). In addition, the Abeta-degrading activity of CatB is inhibited by its endogenous inhibitor, cystatin C (CysC). Reducing CysC expression markedly lowers Abeta levels by enhancing CatB-mediated Abeta degradation in hAPP(FAD) mice. However, because a vast majority of AD patients do not carry familial mutations, we investigated how the CysC-CatB axis affects Abeta levels in mice expressing wild-type hAPP (hAPP(WT)). Enhancing CatB activity by CysC deletion significantly lowered total Abeta and Abeta42 levels in hAPP(WT) mice, whereas CatB deletion increased Abeta levels. To determine whether neuron-derived CatB degrades Abeta in vivo, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing CatB under the control of a neuron-specific enolase promoter. Enhancing neuronal CatB activity in hAPP(WT) mice significantly lowered Abeta42 levels. The processing of hAPP(WT) was unaffected by increasing or ablating CatB activity. Thus, the CysC-CatB axis affects degradation of Abeta42 derived from hAPP lacking familial mutations. These findings support the notion that enhancing CatB activity could lower Abeta, especially Abeta42, in AD patients with or without familial mutations.

23025283|t|Complete thermodynamic and kinetic characterization of the isomer-specific interaction between Pin1-WW domain and the amyloid precursor protein cytoplasmic tail phosphorylated at Thr668.
23025283|a|Peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerization acts as an effective molecular timer that plays significant roles in biological and pathological processes. Enzymes such as Pin1 catalyze cis-trans isomerization, accelerating the otherwise slow isomerization rate into time scales relevant for cellular signaling. Here we have combined NMR line shape analysis, fluorescence spectroscopy, and isothermal titration calorimetry to determine the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters describing the trans-specific interaction between the binding domain of Pin1 (WW domain) and a key cis-trans molecular switch in the amyloid precursor protein cytoplasmic tail. A three-state model, in which the cis-trans isomerization equilibrium is coupled to the binding equilibrium through the trans isomer, was found to fit the data well. The trans isomer binds the WW domain with ~22 muM affinity via very fast association (approaching the diffusion limit) and dissociation rates. The common structural and electrostatic characteristics of Pin1 substrates, which contain a phosphorylated serine/threonine-proline motif, suggest that very rapid binding kinetics are a general feature of Pin1 interactions with other substrates. The fast binding kinetics of the WW domain allows rapid response of Pin1 to the dynamic events of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in the cell that alter the relative populations of diverse Pin1 substrates. Furthermore, our results also highlight the vastly different rates at which slow uncatalyzed cis-trans isomerization and fast isomer-specific binding events occur. These results, along with the experimental methods presented herein, should guide future experiments aimed at the thermodynamic and kinetic characterization of cis-trans molecular switches and isomer-specific interactions involved in various biological processes.

23025824|a|A major effort in Alzheimer's disease therapeutic development has targeted Abeta and downstream events. We have synthesized a small library of tricyclic pyrone compounds. Their protective action in MC65 cells and inhibition of ACAT along with the upregulation of cholesterol transporter gene were investigated. Five active compounds exhibited potencies in the nanomolar ranges. The multiple effects of the compounds on Abeta and cellular cholesterol pathways could be potential mechanisms underlying the protective effects in vivo.

23025847|t|The N-methylated peptide SEN304 powerfully inhibits Abeta(1-42) toxicity by perturbing oligomer formation.
23025847|a|Oligomeric forms of beta-amyloid (Abeta) have potent neurotoxic activity and are the primary cause of neuronal injury and cell death in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Compounds that perturb oligomer formation or structure may therefore be therapeutic for AD. We previously reported that d-[(chGly)-(Tyr)-(chGly)-(chGly)-(mLeu)]-NH(2) (SEN304) is able to inhibit Abeta aggregation and toxicity, shown primarily by thioflavin T fluorescence and MTT (Kokkoni, N. et al. (2006) N-Methylated peptide inhibitors of beta-amyloid aggregation and toxicity. Optimisation of inhibitor structure. Biochemistry 45, 9906-9918). Here we extensively characterize how SEN304 affects Abeta(1-42) aggregation and toxicity, using biophysical assays (thioflavin T, circular dichroism, SDS-PAGE, size exclusion chromatography, surface plasmon resonance, traveling wave ion mobility mass spectrometry, electron microscopy, ELISA), toxicity assays in cell culture (MTT and lactate dehydrogenase in human SH-SHY5Y cells, mouse neuronal cell death and synaptophysin) and long-term potentiation in a rat hippocampal brain slice. These data, with dose response curves, show that SEN304 is a powerful inhibitor of Abeta(1-42) toxicity, particularly effective at preventing Abeta inhibition of long-term potentiation. It can bind directly to Abeta(1-42), delay beta-sheet formation and promote aggregation of toxic oligomers into a nontoxic form, with a different morphology that cannot bind thioflavin T. SEN304 appears to work by inducing aggregation, and hence removal, of Abeta oligomers. It is therefore a promising lead compound for Alzheimer's disease.

23026200|t|Lack of tau proteins rescues neuronal cell death and decreases amyloidogenic processing of APP in APP/PS1 mice.
23026200|a|Lack of tau expression has been reported to protect against excitotoxicity and to prevent memory deficits in mice expressing mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) identified in familial Alzheimer disease. In APP mice, mutant presenilin 1 (PS1) enhances generation of Abeta42 and inhibits cell survival pathways. It is unknown whether the deficient phenotype induced by concomitant expression of mutant PS1 is rescued by absence of tau. In this study, we have analyzed the effect of tau deletion in mice expressing mutant APP and PS1. Although APP/PS1/tau(+/+) mice had a reduced survival, developed spatial memory deficits at 6 months and motor impairments at 12 months, these deficits were rescued in APP/PS1/tau(-/-) mice. Neuronal loss and synaptic loss in APP/PS1/tau(+/+) mice were rescued in the APP/PS1/tau(-/-) mice. The amyloid plaque burden was decreased by roughly 50% in the cortex and the spinal cord of the APP/PS1/tau(-/-) mice. The levels of soluble and insoluble Abeta40 and Abeta42, and the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio were reduced in APP/PS1/tau(-/-) mice. Levels of phosphorylated APP, of beta-C-terminal fragments (CTFs), and of beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) were also reduced, suggesting that beta-secretase cleavage of APP was reduced in APP/PS1/tau(-/-) mice. Our results indicate that tau deletion had a protective effect against amyloid induced toxicity even in the presence of mutant PS1 and reduced the production of Abeta.

23032184|t|L-type calcium channel blockade alleviates molecular and reversal spatial learning and memory alterations induced by entorhinal amyloid pathology in rats.
23032184|a|The entorhinal cortex (EC) is one of the most vulnerable brain regions that is affected by beta amyloid (Abeta) in the early phases of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Calcium dyshomeostasis is one reason of Abeta pathology and the role of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) in this phenomenon has not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the possible neuroprotective effect of CCBs, nimodipine and isradipine against amyloid pathogenesis in EC. The Abeta 1-42 was injected bilaterally into the EC of male rats and spatial performance was assessed between 7 and 12 days after Abeta injection by Morris water maze test. Animals were daily treated by injection of various doses of nimodipine or isradipine (both at 3, 10, or 30 mug/2 mul) or their vehicles into the lateral ventricle until the start of behavioral test. Lesion in EC was assessed by measuring some proteinases involved in calcium dependent apoptotic pathway (calpain 2, caspase 12 and 3). Despite normal performance in probe test, Abeta treated rats showed delayed acquisition in a spatial reference memory task. Abeta treated rats revealed delayed acquisition in reversal memory and had deficit in probe test. The observed impairments were attenuated by isradipine (10 and 30 mug but not 3 mug) and nimodipine (30 mug). Calpain 2, caspase 12 and 3 were increased in the Abeta treated animals which was partially antagonized by isradipine and nimodipine. It is concluded that CCBs might have beneficial therapeutic effects in AD especially in the early phases of this disease.

23033480|t|Soluble amyloid precursor protein 770 is released from inflamed endothelial cells and activated platelets: a novel biomarker for acute coronary syndrome.
23033480|a|BACKGROUND: Separate monitoring of the cleavage products of different amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) variants may provide useful information. RESULTS: We found that soluble APP770 (sAPP770) is released from inflamed endothelial cells and activated platelets as judged by ELISA. CONCLUSION: sAPP770 is an indicator for endothelial and platelet dysfunctions. SIGNIFICANCE: How sAPP770 is released in vivo has been shown. Most Alzheimer disease (AD) patients show deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide in blood vessels as well as the brain parenchyma. We previously found that vascular endothelial cells express amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) 770, a different APP isoform from neuronal APP695, and produce Abeta. Since the soluble APP cleavage product, sAPP, is considered to be a possible marker for AD diagnosis, sAPP has been widely measured as a mixture of these variants. We hypothesized that measurement of the endothelial APP770 cleavage product in patients separately from that of neuronal APP695 would enable discrimination between endothelial and neurological dysfunctions. Using our newly developed ELISA system for sAPP770, we observed that inflammatory cytokines significantly enhanced sAPP770 secretion by endothelial cells. Furthermore, we unexpectedly found that sAPP770 was rapidly released from activated platelets. We also found that cerebrospinal fluid mainly contained sAPP695, while serum mostly contained sAPP770. Finally, to test our hypothesis that sAPP770 could be an indicator for endothelial dysfunction, we applied our APP770 ELISA to patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), in which endothelial injury and platelet activation lead to fibrous plaque disruption and thrombus formation. Development of a biomarker is essential to facilitate ACS diagnosis in clinical practice. The results revealed that ACS patients had significantly higher plasma sAPP770 levels. Furthermore, in myocardial infarction model rats, an increase in plasma sAPP preceded the release of cardiac enzymes, currently used markers for acute myocardial infarction. These findings raise the possibility that sAPP770 can be a useful biomarker for ACS.

23036592|t|A peptide prime-DNA boost immunization protocol provides significant benefits as a new generation Abeta42 DNA vaccine for Alzheimer disease.
23036592|a|Immunotherapy has the potential to provide a possible treatment therapy to prevent or delay Alzheimer disease. In a clinical trial (AN1792) in which patients received this immunotherapy and received active Abeta1-42 peptide immunizations, treatment was stopped when 6% of patients showed signs of meningoencephalitis. Follow up on these patients led to the conclusion that the antibody response was beneficial in removing Abeta1-42 from brain but an accompanying inflammatory Th1 T cell response was harmful. As a safe alternative treatment targeting the same self protein, Abeta1-42, in brain, we and others are working on a DNA Abeta1-42 immunization protocol as the immune response to DNA immunizations differs in many aspects from immunizations with peptide antigens. Because the immune response to DNA vaccination has different kinetics and has a significantly lower antibody production, we evaluated two different prime boost regimens, Abeta1-42 DNA prime/Abeta1-42 peptide boost and Abeta1-42 peptide prime/Abeta1-42 DNA boost for their effectiveness in antibody production and possible side effects due to inflammatory T cell responses. While both boost regimes significantly enhanced the specific antibody production with comparable antibody concentrations, the absence of the Abeta1-42 T cell response (no proliferation and no cytokine production) is consistent with our previous findings using this DNA Abeta1-42 trimer immunization and greatly enhances the safety aspect for possible clinical use.

23038754|t|A truncated peptide from p35, a Cdk5 activator, prevents Alzheimer's disease phenotypes in model mice.
23038754|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the leading neurodegenerative disorders of older adults, which causes major socioeconomic burdens globally, lacks effective therapeutics without significant side effects. Besides the hallmark pathology of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), it has been reported that cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), a critical neuronal kinase, is hyperactivated in AD brains and is, in part, responsible for the above pathology. Here we show that a modified truncated 24-aa peptide (TFP5), derived from the Cdk5 activator p35, penetrates the blood-brain barrier after intraperitoneal injections, inhibits abnormal Cdk5 hyperactivity, and significantly rescues AD pathology (up to 70-80%) in 5XFAD AD model mice. The mutant mice, injected with TFP5 exhibit behavioral rescue, whereas no rescue was observed in mutant mice injected with either saline or scrambled peptide. However, TFP5 does not inhibit cell cycle Cdks or normal Cdk5/p35 activity, and thereby has no toxic side effects (even at 200 mg/kg), a common problem in most current therapeutics for AD. In addition, treated mice displayed decreased inflammation, amyloid plaques, NFTs, cell death, and an extended life by 2 mo. These results suggest TFP5 as a potential therapeutic, toxicity-free candidate for AD.

23041059|t|Spectral discrimination of cerebral amyloid lesions after peripheral application of luminescent conjugated oligothiophenes.
23041059|a|In vivo imaging of pathological protein aggregates provides essential knowledge of the kinetics and implications of these lesions in the progression of proteopathies, such as Alzheimer disease. Luminescent conjugated oligothiophenes are amyloid-specific ligands that bind and spectrally distinguish different types of amyloid aggregates. Herein, we report that heptamer formyl thiophene acetic acid (hFTAA) passes the blood-brain barrier after systemic administration and specifically binds to extracellular beta-amyloid deposits in the brain parenchyma (Abeta plaques) and in the vasculature (cerebral beta-amyloid angiopathy) of beta-amyloid precursor protein transgenic APP23 mice. Moreover, peripheral application of hFTAA also stained intracellular lesions of hyperphosphorylated Tau protein in P301S Tau transgenic mice. Spectral profiling of all three amyloid types was acquired ex vivo using two-photon excitation. hFTAA revealed a distinct shift in its emission spectra when bound to Abeta plaques versus Tau lesions. Furthermore, a spectral shift was observed for Abeta plaques versus cerebral beta-amyloid angiopathy, indicating that different amyloid types and structural variances of a specific amyloid type can be distinguished. In conclusion, by adding spectral signatures to amyloid lesions, our results pave the way for a new area of in vivo amyloid imaging, allowing in vivo differentiation of amyloid (sub)types and monitoring changes of their structure/composition over time.

23041348|t|Antioxidant role of amyloid beta protein in cell-free and biological systems: implication for the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease.
23041348|a|In contrast to many studies showing the pro-oxidative nature of amyloid peptide, this work shows that aggregated Abeta42 peptide in varying concentrations (2-20 muM) in cell-free systems inhibits the formation of hydroxyl radicals and H(2)O(2) from a mixture of iron (20 muM FeSO(4)) and ascorbate (2mM) as measured by benzoate hydroxylation assay and coumarin carboxylic acid assay. Aggregated Abeta42 in similar concentrations further prevents protein and lipid oxidation in isolated rat brain mitochondria incubated alone or with FeSO(4) and ascorbate. Moreover, mitochondria exposed to FeSO(4) and ascorbate show enhanced formation of reactive oxygen species and this phenomenon is also abolished by aggregated Abeta42. It is suggested that the antioxidant property of Abeta42 in various systems is mediated by metal chelation and it is nearly as potent as a typical metal chelator, such as diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, in preventing oxidative damage. However, aggregated Abeta42 causes mitochondrial functional impairment in the form of membrane depolarization and a loss of phosphorylation capacity without involving reactive oxygen species in the process. Thus, the present results suggest that the amyloid peptide exhibits a protective antioxidant role in biological systems, but also has toxic actions independent of oxidative stress.

23041425|t|Salt anions promote the conversion of HypF-N into amyloid-like oligomers and modulate the structure of the oligomers and the monomeric precursor state.
23041425|a|An understanding of the solution factors contributing to the rate of aggregation of a protein into amyloid oligomers, to the modulation of the conformational state populated prior to aggregation and to the structure/morphology of the resulting oligomers is one of the goals of present research in this field. We have studied the influence of six different salts on the conversion of the N-terminal domain of Escherichiacoli HypF (HypF-N) into amyloid-like oligomers under conditions of acidic pH. Our results show that salts having different anions (NaCl, NaClO(4), NaI, Na(2)SO(4)) accelerate oligomerization with an efficacy that follows the electroselectivity series of the anions (SO(4)(2-)>= ClO(4)(-)>I(-)>Cl(-)). By contrast, salts with different cations (NaCl, LiCl, KCl) have similar effects. We also investigated the effect of salts on the structure of the final and initial states of HypF-N aggregation. The electroselectivity series does not apply to the effect of anions on the structure of the oligomers. By contrast, it applies to their effect on the content of secondary structure and on the exposure of hydrophobic clusters of the monomeric precursor state. The results therefore indicate that the binding of anions to the positively charged residues of HypF-N at low pH is the mechanism by which salts modulate the rate of oligomerization and the structure of the monomeric precursor state but not the structure of the resulting oligomers. Overall, the data contribute to rationalize the effect of salts on amyloid-like oligomer formation and to explain the role of charged biological macromolecules in protein aggregation processes.

23041958|t|Origins of Alzheimer's disease:  reconciling cerebrospinal fluid biomarker and neuropathology data regarding the temporal sequence of amyloid-beta and tau involvement.
23041958|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review aims to address the temporal sequencing of involvement of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and reconcile apparently conflicting neuropathologic and biomarker data. RECENT FINDINGS: Although neuropathologic studies show that limbic system tau disease occurs ubiquitously in middle-aged individuals before the appearance of amyloid plaques, biomarker studies in living individuals suggest that Abeta disease is the initiating event in Alzheimer's disease and precedes cerebrospinal fluid tau changes. Evidence from neuropathologic, biomarker, genetic and cellular/mouse studies shows that tau accumulation in limbic regions occurs slowly with age and does not induce widespread neurodegeneration, but that Abeta interacts with tau in some way to accelerate neurofibrillary disease and induce neurodegeneration. SUMMARY: Abeta aggregation is the key initial trigger of Alzheimer's disease pathologic changes and interacts with tau to exacerbate age-related tauopathy and induce neurodegeneration.

23043097|t|Retention in endoplasmic reticulum 1 (RER1) modulates amyloid-beta (Abeta) production by altering trafficking of gamma-secretase and amyloid precursor protein (APP).
23043097|a|BACKGROUND: Abeta production is influenced by intracellular trafficking of secretases and amyloid precursor protein (APP). RESULTS: Retention in endoplasmic reticulum 1 (RER1) regulates the trafficking of gamma-secretase and APP, thereby influences Abeta production. CONCLUSION: RER1, an ER retention/retrieval factor for gamma-secretase and APP, modulates Abeta production. SIGNIFICANCE: RER1 and its influence on gamma-secretase and APP may be implicated for a safe strategy to target Abeta production. The presence of neuritic plaques containing aggregated amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides in the brain parenchyma is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD). Abeta is generated by sequential cleavage of the amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretase, respectively. As APP processing to Abeta requires transport through the secretory pathway, trafficking of the substrate and access to the secretases are key factors that can influence Abeta production (Thinakaran, G., and Koo, E. H. (2008) Amyloid precursor protein trafficking, processing, and function. J. Biol. Chem. 283, 29615-29619). Here, we report that retention in endoplasmic reticulum 1 (RER1) associates with gamma-secretase in early secretory compartments and regulates the intracellular trafficking of gamma-secretase. RER1 overexpression decreases both gamma-secretase localization on the cell surface and Abeta secretion and conversely RER1 knockdown increases the level of cell surface gamma-secretase and increases Abeta secretion. Furthermore, we find that increased RER1 levels decrease mature APP and increase immature APP, resulting in less surface accumulation of APP. These data show that RER1 influences the trafficking and localization of both gamma-secretase and APP, thereby regulating the production and secretion of Abeta peptides.

23043377|t|Local structure and global patterning of Cu2+ binding in fibrillar amyloid-beta [Abeta(1-40)] protein.
23043377|a|The amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein forms fibrils and higher-order plaque aggegrates in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. The copper ion, Cu(2+), is found at high concentrations in plaques, but its role in AD etiology is unclear. We use high-resolution pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to characterize the coordination structure of Cu(2+) in the fibrillar form of full-length Abeta(1-40). The results reveal a bis-cis-histidine (His) equatorial Cu(2+) coordination geometry and participation of all three N-terminal His residues in Cu(2+) binding. A model is proposed in which Cu(2+)-His6/His13 and Cu(2+)-His6/His14 sites alternate along the fibril axis on opposite sides of the beta-sheet fibril structure. The local intra-beta-strand coordination structure is not conducive to Cu(2+)/Cu(+) redox-linked coordination changes, and the global arrangement of Cu sites precludes facile multielectron and bridged-metal site reactivity. This indicates that the fibrillar form of Abeta suppresses Cu redox cycling and reactive oxygen species production. The configuration suggests application of Cu(2+)-Abeta fibrils as an amyloid architecture for switchable electron charge/spin coupling and redox reactivity.

23044228|t|Clioquinol-induced increase and decrease in the intracellular Zn2+ level in rat thymocytes.
23044228|a|AIMS: Clioquinol is emerging as a potential therapy for some diseases, such as Alzheimer disease and cancer. This agent is a lipophilic chelator of Zn(2+). In this study, the effect of clioquinol on the intracellular Zn(2+) level was examined in order to gain insights into the toxicological profile of clioquinol. MAIN METHODS: The effect of clioquinol was estimated using a flow cytometer and FluoZin-3, a fluorescent indicator for Zn(2+), in rat thymocytes. KEY FINDINGS: Clioquinol, at concentrations ranging from 10 to 300 nM, augmented FluoZin-3 fluorescence in a concentration-dependent manner. However, the effect induced by 1 muM clioquinol was less than that by 300 nM clioquinol. Removal of extracellular Zn(2+), using the membrane impermeable Zn(2+)-chelator diethylenetriamine-N,N,N',N'',N''-pentaacetic acid (DTPA), abolished the clioquinol-induced augmentation of FluoZin-3 fluorescence. Clioquinol did not augment Fluo-3 fluorescence, an indicator of intracellular Ca(2+), in the presence of DTPA. The results suggested that clioquinol caused an extracellular Zn(2+)-dependent increase in the intracellular Zn(2+) concentration. However, in the presence of DTPA, clioquinol at micromolar concentrations (1-10 muM) attenuated FluoZin-3 fluorescence in a concentration-dependent manner. Clioquinol even at 10 muM did not affect FluoZin-3 fluorescence under cell-free condition. The concentration-response relationship for the clioquinol induced change in Zn(2+) level appeared to be bell-shaped. These results indicate that micromolar concentrations of clioquinol, without chelated Zn(2+), decrease intracellular Zn(2+) concentration. SIGNIFICANCE: The effect of clioquinol on the intracellular Zn(2+) level varies, depending on the extracellular Zn(2+) concentration and the clioquinol concentration. Clioquinol may therefore exert various types of Zn(2+)-dependent cytotoxicity.

23048024|t|Discovery of AZD3839, a potent and selective BACE1 inhibitor clinical candidate for the treatment of Alzheimer disease.
23048024|a|beta-Site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme1 (BACE1) is one of the key enzymes involved in the processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and formation of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) species. Because cerebral deposition of Abeta species might be critical for the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease, BACE1 has emerged as a key target for the treatment of this disease. Here, we report the discovery and comprehensive preclinical characterization of AZD3839, a potent and selective inhibitor of human BACE1. AZD3839 was identified using fragment-based screening and structure-based design. In a concentration-dependent manner, AZD3839 inhibited BACE1 activity in a biochemical fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay, Abeta and sAPPbeta release from modified and wild-type human SH-SY5Y cells and mouse N2A cells as well as from mouse and guinea pig primary cortical neurons. Selectivity against BACE2 and cathepsin D was 14 and >1000-fold, respectively. AZD3839 exhibited dose- and time-dependent lowering of plasma, brain, and cerebrospinal fluid Abeta levels in mouse, guinea pig, and non-human primate. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses of mouse and guinea pig data showed a good correlation between the potency of AZD3839 in primary cortical neurons and in vivo brain effects. These results suggest that AZD3839 effectively reduces the levels of Abeta in brain, CSF, and plasma in several preclinical species. It might, therefore, have disease-modifying potential in the treatment of Alzheimer disease and related dementias. Based on the overall pharmacological profile and its drug like properties, AZD3839 has been progressed into Phase 1 clinical trials in man.

23050487|t|Longitudinal characterization of the brain proteomes for the tg2576 amyloid mouse model using shotgun based mass spectrometry.
23050487|a|Neurodegenerative disorders are often defined pathologically by the presence of protein aggregates, such as amyloid plaques composed of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide in Alzheimer's disease. Such aggregates are the result of abnormal protein accumulation and may lead to neuronal dysfunction and cell death. In this study, APPSWE transgenic mice (Tg2576), which overexpress the Swedish mutated form of human amyloid precursor protein (APP), were used to study the brain proteome associated with amyloid plaque deposition. The major aim of the study was to map and compare the Tg2576 model brain proteome profiles during pathology progression using a shotgun approach based on label free quantification with mass spectrometry. Overall, 1085 proteins were identified and longitudinally quantified. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed the appearance of the pathology onset between twelve and fifteen months, correlating with sharp amyloid plaque accumulation within the same ages. Cluster analysis followed by protein-protein interaction analysis revealed an age-dependent decrease in mitochondrial protein expression. We identified 57 significantly affected mitochondrial proteins, several of which have been reported to alter expression in neurological diseases. We also found ten proteins that are upregulated early in the amyloid driven pathology progression with high confidence, some of which are directly involved in the onset of mitochondrial apoptosis and may represent potential markers for use in human neurological diseases prognosis. Our results further contribute to identifying common pathological pathways involved in both aging and progressive neurodegenerative disorders enhancing the understanding of disease pathogenesis.

23051147|t|Explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations of Abeta peptide interacting with ibuprofen ligands.
23051147|a|Using all-atom explicit water model and replica exchange molecular dynamics, we study the interactions between Abeta monomer and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen, which is known to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Ibuprofen binding to Abeta is largely governed by hydrophobic effect, and its binding site in Abeta peptide is entirely composed of hydrophobic amino acids. Electrostatic interactions between negatively charged ibuprofen ligands and positively charged side chains make a relatively small contribution to binding. This outcome is explained by the competition of ligand-peptide electrostatic interactions with intrapeptide salt bridges. Consistent with the experiments, the S-isomer of ibuprofen binds with stronger affinity to Abeta than the R-isomer. Conformational ensemble of Abeta monomer in ibuprofen solution reveals two structured regions, 19-25 (R1) and 29-35 (R2), composed of turn/helix and helix structure, respectively. The clustering technique and free energy analysis suggest that Abeta conformational ensemble is mainly determined by the formation of Asp23-Lys28 salt bridge and the hydrophobic interactions between R1 and R2. Control simulations of Abeta peptide in ligand-free water show that ibuprofen binding changes Abeta structure by promoting the formation of helix and Asp23-Lys28 salt bridge. Implications of our findings for Abeta amyloidogenesis are discussed.

23053137|t|[(18)F]Flutemetamol PET imaging and cortical biopsy histopathology for fibrillar amyloid beta detection in living subjects with normal pressure hydrocephalus: pooled analysis of four studies.
23053137|a|Molecular imaging techniques developed to 'visualize' amyloid in vivo represent a major achievement in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. This pooled analysis of four studies determined the level of association between uptake of the fibrillar amyloid beta positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent [(18)F]flutemetamol (Pittsburgh Compound B analog with a 5.5 times longer half-life to enable it to be used in the clinical setting) and neuritic plaques and fibrillar amyloid beta measured by pathologic staining of cortical region biopsy samples. Fifty-two patients with suspected normal pressure hydrocephalus underwent prospective (n = 30) or retrospective (n = 22) [(18)F]flutemetamol PET imaging for detection of cerebral cortical fibrillar amyloid beta and cortical brain biopsy during intracranial pressure measurement or ventriculo-peritoneal shunting. [(18)F]Flutemetamol uptake was quantified using standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) with cerebellar cortex as the reference region. Tissue fibrillar amyloid beta was evaluated using immunohistochemical monoclonal antibody 4G8 and histochemical agents Thioflavin S and Bielschowsky silver stain, and an overall pathology result based on all available immunohistochemical and histochemical results. Biopsy site and contralateral [(18)F]flutemetamol SUVRs were significantly associated with neuritic plaque burden assessed with Bielschowsky silver stain (r                 (spearman's) = 0.61, p = 0.0001 for both), as was the composite SUVR with biopsy pathology (r                 (spearman's) = 0.74, p < 0.0001). SUVR and immunohistochemical results with 4G8 for detecting fibrillar amyloid beta were similar. Blinded image evaluation showed strong agreement between readers (kappa = 0.86). Overall sensitivity and specificity by majority read were 93 and 100 %. Noninvasive in vivo [(18)F]flutemetamol PET imaging demonstrates strong concordance with histopathology for brain fibrillar amyloid beta, supporting its promise as a tool to assist physicians with earlier detection of the disease process and making diagnostic decisions about concomitant AD and other diseases associated with brain amyloidosis.

23058290|t|Transient small molecule interactions kinetically modulate amyloid beta peptide self-assembly.
23058290|a|Small organic molecules, like Congo red and lacmoid, have been shown to modulate the self-assembly of the amyloid beta peptide (Abeta). Here, we show that Abeta forms NMR invisible non-toxic co-aggregates together with lacmoid as well as Congo red. We find that the interaction involves two distinct kinetic processes and at every given time point only a small fraction of Abeta is in the co-aggregate. These weak transient interactions kinetically redirect the aggregation prone Abeta from self-assembling into amyloid fibrils. These findings suggest that even such weak binders might be effective as therapeutics against pathogenic protein aggregation.

23058852|t|Suspected limited efficacy of gamma-secretase modulators.
23058852|a|Mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are associated with changes in gamma-secretase activity in the brain, producing an amyloid beta-protein-42-lowering gamma-modulator-like effect. We show here that this modulation occurs at the stage of amyloid deposition, presumably decades earlier than the onset of AD. In addition, gamma-secretase modulator-1, a gamma-modulator, altered gamma-secretase activity in the AD brain but to a lesser extent than in the normal brain. These findings suggest that gamma-modulators have limited efficacy against amyloid deposition and AD.

23062342|t|beta-Amyloid (1-40) peptide interactions with supported phospholipid membranes: a single-molecule study.
23062342|a|Recent evidence supports the hypothesis that the oligomers formed by the beta-amyloid peptide early in its aggregation process are neurotoxic and may feature in Alzheimer's disease. Although the mechanism underlying this neurotoxicity remains unclear, interactions of these oligomers with neuronal membranes are believed to be involved. Identifying the neurotoxic species is challenging because beta-amyloid peptides form oligomers at very low physiological concentrations (nM), and these oligomers are highly heterogeneous and metastable. Here, we report the use of single-molecule imaging techniques to study the interactions between beta-amyloid (1-40) peptides and supported synthetic model anionic lipid membranes. The evolution of the beta-amyloid species on the membranes was monitored for up to several days, and the results indicate an initial tight, uniform, binding of beta-amyloid (1-40) peptides to the lipid membranes, followed by oligomer formation in the membrane. At these low concentrations, the behavior at early times during the formation of small oligomers is interpreted qualitatively in terms of the two-state model proposed by H. W. Huang for the interaction between amphipathic peptides and membranes. However, the rate of oligomer formation in the membrane and their size are highly dependent on the concentrations of beta-amyloid (1-40) peptides in aqueous solution, suggesting two different pathways of oligomer formation, which lead to drastically different species in the membrane and a departure from the two-state model as the concentration increases.

23062825|t|Exploration of natural compounds as sources of new bifunctional scaffolds targeting cholinesterases and beta amyloid aggregation: the case of chelerythrine.
23062825|a|The presented project started by screening a library consisting of natural and natural based compounds for their acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitory activity. Active compounds were chemically clustered into groups and further tested on the human cholinesterases isoforms. The aim of the presented study was to identify compounds that could be used as leads to target two key mechanisms associated with the AD's pathogenesis simultaneously: cholinergic depletion and beta amyloid (Abeta) aggregation. Berberin, palmatine and chelerythrine, chemically clustered in the so-called isoquinoline group, showed promising cholinesterase inhibitory activity and were therefore further investigated. Moreover, the compounds demonstrated moderate to good inhibition of Abeta aggregation as well as the ability to disaggregate already preformed Abeta aggregates in an experimental set-up using HFIP as promotor of Abeta aggregates. Analysis of the kinetic mechanism of the AChE inhibition revealed chelerythrine as a mixed inhibitor. Using molecular docking studies, it was further proven that chelerythrine binds on both the catalytic site and the peripheral anionic site (PAS) of the AChE. In view of this, we went on to investigate its effect on inhibiting Abeta aggregation stimulated by AChE. Chelerythrine showed inhibition of fibril formation in the same range as propidium iodide. This approach enabled for the first time to identify a cholinesterase inhibitor of natural origin-chelerythrine-acting on AChE and BChE with a dual ability to inhibit Abeta aggregation as well as to disaggregate preformed Abeta aggregates. This compound could be an excellent starting point paving the way to develop more successful anti-AD drugs.

23063647|t|Prazosin, an alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, prevents memory deterioration in the APP23 transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
23063647|a|Noradrenergic deficits have been described in the hippocampus and the frontal cortex of Alzheimer's disease brains, which are secondary to locus coeruleus degeneration. Locus coeruleus is the brain stem nucleus responsible for synthesis of noradrenaline and from where all noradrenergic neurons project. In addition, it has been suggested that noradrenaline might play a role in modulating inflammatory responses in Alzheimer's disease. In this study we aimed to investigate the effect of various agonists and antagonists for adrenergic receptors on amyloid precursor protein processing. Among them, we found that prazosin, an alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, was able to reduce the generation of amyloid beta in N2a cells. Treatment of transgenic APP23 mice with prazosin prevented memory deficits over time. Although prazosin did not influence amyloid plaque load, it induced astrocytic proliferation and increased the release of apolipoprotein E and anti-inflammatory cytokines. These findings suggest that chronic treatment with prazosin leads to an anti-inflammatory response with potential beneficial effects on cognitive performance.

23064434|t|Neuronal activity and secreted amyloid beta lead to altered amyloid beta precursor protein and presenilin 1 interactions.
23064434|a|Deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) containing plaques in the brain is one of the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has been suggested that modulation of neuronal activity may alter Abeta production in the brain. We postulate that these changes in Abeta production are due to changes in the rate-limiting step of Abeta generation, APP cleavage by gamma-secretase. By combining biochemical approaches with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, we found that neuronal inhibition decreases endogenous APP and PS1 interactions, which correlates with reduced Abeta production. By contrast, neuronal activation had a two-phase effect: it initially enhanced APP-PS1 interaction leading to increased Abeta production, which followed by a decrease in the APP and PS1 proximity/interaction. Accordingly, treatment of neurons with naturally secreted Abeta isolated from AD brain or with synthetic Abeta resulted in reduced APP and PS1 proximity. Moreover, applying low concentration of Abeta(42) to cultured neurons inhibited de novo Abeta synthesis. These data provide evidence that neuronal activity regulates endogenous APP-PS1 interactions, and suggest a model of a product-enzyme negative feedback. Thus, under normal physiological conditions Abeta may impact its own production by modifying gamma-secretase cleavage of APP. Disruption of this negative modulation may cause Abeta overproduction leading to neurotoxicity.

23064606|t|Modulation of the number and functions of endothelial progenitor cells by interleukin 1beta in the peripheral blood of pigs: involvement of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in vitro.
23064606|a|BACKGROUND: Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have therapeutic potential for the treatment of organ ischemia following trauma or sepsis, frequently associated with inflammatory conditions. We aimed to investigate the effects of interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) on the properties of EPCs and explore its possible relationship with p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). METHODS: EPCs were isolated from peripheral blood of a porcine model and were characterized. Effects of IL-1beta on cell number, proliferation, migration, adhesion, and angiogenic function of EPCs were evaluated in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The activity of p38 MAPK in EPCs was measured by Western blot. Moreover, the effects of SB203580, a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor, on levels of p38 MAPK phosphorylation and the number and functions of EPCs under IL-1beta conditions were examined. RESULTS: Incubation of EPCs with IL-1beta (5 ng/mL) for 5 days and with IL-1beta (0.05-50 ng/mL) for 48 hours induced a significant reduction in EPC numbers and proliferation, respectively (p < 0.01 vs. control cells). The capacities for migration, adhesion, and angiogenic function of EPCs were also reduced in a time- and dose-dependent manner. IL-1beta induced dose- and time-dependent activation of p38 MAPK in EPCs. Moreover, inhibition of p38 MAPK by SB203580 significantly increased the total number of EPCs by twofold as compared with the IL-1beta-alone group (p < 0.01) and blocked the ability of IL-1beta to impair the functional response of EPCs. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that there is a negative cause-effect relationship between IL-1beta and EPCs. Thus, IL-1beta inhibits EPC proliferation, migration, adhesion, and tube formation by a mechanism, which involves p38 MAPK signaling in regulating the number and functions of EPCs in vitro.

23069872|t|Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of beta-amyloid metabolism in multiple sclerosis.
23069872|a|BACKGROUND: Amyloid precursor protein (APP) and amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides are intensely studied in neuroscience and their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measurements may be used to track the metabolic pathways of APP in vivo. Reduced CSF levels of Abeta and soluble APP (sAPP) fragments are reported in inflammatory diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS); but in MS, the precise pathway of APP metabolism and whether it can be affected by disease-modifying treatments remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the CSF biomarkers of APP degradation in MS, including the effects of disease-modifying therapy. METHODS: CSF samples from 87 MS patients (54 relapsing-remitting (RR) MS; 33 secondary progressive (SP) MS and 28 controls were analyzed for sAPP and Abeta peptides by immunoassays, plus a subset of samples was analyzed by immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry (IP-MS). Patients treated with natalizumab or mitoxantrone were examined at baseline, and after 1-2 years of treatment. RESULTS: CSF sAPP and Abeta peptide levels were reduced in MS patients; but they increased again towards normal, after natalizumab treatment. A multivariate model of IP-MS-measured Abeta species separated the SPMS patients from controls, with RRMS patients having intermediate levels. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed and extended our previous observations of altered CSF sAPP and Abeta peptide levels in MS patients. We found that natalizumab therapy may be able to counteract the altered APP metabolism in MS. The CSF Abeta isoform distribution was found to be distinct in SPMS patients, as compared to the controls.

23070049|t|Munc13 genotype regulates secretory amyloid precursor protein processing via postsynaptic glutamate receptors.
23070049|a|The amyloid precursor protein (APP) can be proteolytically degraded via non-amyloidogenic alpha-secretase and amyloidogenic beta-secretase pathways. Previously, we have identified the presynaptic protein Munc13-1 as a diacylglycerol/phorbolester (DAG/PE) receptor that contributes to secretory, non-amyloidogenic APP processing after PE stimulation. Here, we used organotypic brain slice cultures from wild-type mice and from Munc13-1 knock-out (KO), Munc13-2 KO and Munc13-1/2 double KO (DKO) mice for pharmacological stimulation experiments. First, we demonstrate that neuronal populations and synaptic components important for secretory APP processing develop normally in organotypic brain slice cultures of all genotypes analyzed. Blockade of voltage-gated Na(+) channels by tetrodotoxin reduced the PE-stimulated secretory APP processing, whereas depolarization by high extracellular K(+) concentration evoked APP secretion. Additionally, the PE-stimulated APP secretion from Munc13-1 KO brain slices was significantly lower than that from wild-type brain slices. This effect was not observed in brain slices from Munc13-2 KO mice, which is consistent with the lower abundance and subpopulation-specific distribution of Munc13-2 in presynaptic elements. In Munc13-1/2 DKO brain slices, the deficiency of Munc13-1 dominated the effect of APP processing. The Munc13-1 KO effect on APP processing could be rescued by the stimulation of postsynaptic glutamatergic receptors. This indicates that lack of postsynaptic glutamate receptor stimulation in Munc13-1 KO brain slice cultures but not presynaptic mechanisms account for compromised APP processing. We conclude that organotypic brain slices cultures are a valuable tool for studying APP processing pathways in intact neuronal circuits and that neuronal activity is important for maintenance of the non-amyloidogenic APP processing.

23071163|t|Stronger effect of amyloid load than APOE genotype on cognitive decline in healthy older adults.
23071163|a|OBJECTIVE: Although the APOE epsilon4 allele is associated with more rapid decline in memory in healthy older adults, the significance of elevated cerebral beta-amyloid (Abeta) load for longitudinal changes in cognition is unclear. METHODS: Healthy and cognitively normal older adults (n = 141; mean age 76 years) underwent PET neuroimaging for cerebral Abeta, APOE genotyping, and cognitive assessment as part of their baseline assessment in the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle study. Cognitive function was reassessed 18 months later. RESULTS: Linear mixed-model analyses adjusted for baseline cognitive function indicated that, relative to individuals with low cerebral Abeta, individuals with high cerebral Abeta showed significantly greater decline in working memory and verbal and visual episodic memory at 18 months. Compared with noncarriers, APOE epsilon4 carriers showed a greater decline in visual memory at the 18-month assessment. No interaction between APOE epsilon4 and cerebral Abeta load was observed for any measure of cognitive function. CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective study of healthy older adults, high cerebral Abeta load was associated with greater decline in episodic and working memory over 18 months. The APOE epsilon4 genotype was also associated with a decline in visual memory, although the effect was less than that observed for cerebral Abeta load.

23071306|t|Microglial repopulation model reveals a robust homeostatic process for replacing CNS myeloid cells.
23071306|a|Under most physiological circumstances, monocytes are excluded from parenchymal CNS tissues. When widespread monocyte entry occurs, their numbers decrease shortly after engraftment in the presence of microglia. However, some disease processes lead to focal and selective loss, or dysfunction, of microglia, and microglial senescence typifies the aged brain. In this regard, the long-term engraftment of monocytes in the microglia-depleted brain remains unknown. Here, we report a model in which a niche for myeloid cells was created through microglia depletion. We show that microglia-depleted brain regions of CD11b-HSVTK transgenic mice are repopulated with new Iba-1-positive cells within 2 wk. The engrafted cells expressed high levels of CD45 and CCR2 and appeared in a wave-like pattern frequently associated with blood vessels, suggesting the engrafted cells were peripheral monocytes. Although two times more numerous and morphologically distinct from resident microglia up to 27 wk after initial engraftment, the overall distribution of the engrafted cells was remarkably similar to that of microglia. Two-photon in vivo imaging revealed that the engrafted myeloid cells extended their processes toward an ATP source and displayed intracellular calcium transients. Moreover, the engrafted cells migrated toward areas of kainic acid-induced neuronal death. These data provide evidence that circulating monocytes have the potential to occupy the adult CNS myeloid niche normally inhabited by microglia and identify a strong homeostatic drive to maintain the myeloid component in the mature brain.

23073831|t|Protection against the synaptic targeting and toxicity of Alzheimer's-associated Abeta oligomers by insulin mimetic chiro-inositols.
23073831|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive dementia that correlates highly with synapse loss. This loss appears due to the synaptic accumulation of toxic Abeta oligomers (ADDLs), which damages synapse structure and function. Although it has been reported that oligomer binding and toxicity can be prevented by stimulation of neuronal insulin signaling with PPARgamma agonists, these agonists have problematic side effects. We therefore investigated the therapeutic potential of chiro-inositols, insulin-sensitizing compounds safe for human consumption. Chiro-inositols have been studied extensively for treatment of diseases associated with peripheral insulin resistance, but their insulin mimetic function in memory-relevant central nervous system (CNS) cells is unknown. Here we demonstrate that mature cultures of hippocampal neurons respond to d-chiro-inositol (DCI), pinitol (3-O-methyl DCI), and the inositol glycan INS-2 (pinitol beta-1-4 galactosamine) with increased phosphorylation in key upstream components in the insulin-signaling pathway (insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate-1, and Akt). Consistent with insulin stimulation, DCI treatment promotes rapid withdrawal of dendritic insulin receptors. With respect to neuroprotection, DCI greatly enhances the ability of insulin to prevent ADDL-induced synapse damage (EC(50) of 90 nM). The mechanism comprises inhibition of oligomer binding at synapses and requires insulin/IGF signaling. DCI showed no effects on Abeta oligomerization. We propose that inositol glycans and DCI, a compound already established as safe for human consumption, have potential as AD therapeutics by protecting CNS synapses against Abeta oligomers through their insulin mimetic activity.

23075678|t|Protective effects of ferulic acid in amyloid precursor protein plus presenilin-1 transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer disease.
23075678|a|We previously reported the protective effects of long-term administration of ferulic acid against the in vivo toxicity of beta-amyloid peptide administered intracerebroventricularly in mice. In the present study, we investigated the effects of ferulic acid in transgenic amyloid precursor protein (APP)swe/presenilin 1 (PS1)dE9 (APP/PS1) mouse model of Alzheimer disease (AD). Chronic (for 6 months from the age of 6 to 12 months) oral administration of ferulic acid at a dose of 5.3 mg/kg/day significantly enhanced the performance in novel-object recognition task, and reduced amyloid deposition and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) levels in the frontal cortex. These results suggest that ferulic acid at a certain dosage could be useful for prevention and treatment of AD.

23076628|t|Activation of PARP by oxidative stress induced by beta-amyloid: implications for Alzheimer's disease.
23076628|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative disease of old age, characterised by progressive cognitive impairment, dementia and atrophy of the central nervous system. The pathological hallmarks include the accumulation of the peptide beta-amyloid (Abeta) which itself is toxic to neurons in culture. Recently, it has been discovered that Abeta activates the protein poly(ADP-ribosyl) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) specifically in astrocytes, leading indirectly to neuronal cell death. PARP-1 is a DNA repair enzyme, normally activated by single strand breaks associated with oxidative stress, which catalyses the formation of poly ADP-ribose polymers from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)). The pathological over activation of PARP-1 causes depletion of NAD(+) and leads to cell death. Here we review the relationship between AD and PARP-1, and explore the role played by astrocytes in neuronal death. AD has so far proven refractory to any effective treatment. Identification of these pathways represents a step towards a greater understanding of the pathophysiology of this devastating disease with the potential to explore novel therapeutic targets.

23077040|a|We demonstrate label-free imaging of cerebral beta-amyloidosis ex vivo and in a living mouse model of Alzheimer's disease using extended-focus Fourier domain optical coherence microscopy (xfOCM). xfOCM provides 3D, high-resolution images of individual beta-amyloid plaques in the brain parenchyma and vasculature and requires no staining of the alzheimeric sample under investigation. xfOCM also opens the possibility to perform minimally invasive studies of beta-amyloid pathology in vivo, without the use of labeling methods, which potentially confound experimental findings.

23078235|t|Metabonomic profiling of TASTPM transgenic Alzheimer's disease mouse model.
23078235|a|Identification of molecular mechanisms underlying early stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) is important for the development of new therapies against and diagnosis of AD. In this study, nontargeted metabonomics of TASTPM transgenic AD mice was performed. The metabolic profiles of both brain and plasma of TASTPM mice were characterized using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and compared to those of wild-type C57BL/6J mice. TASTPM mice were metabolically distinct compared to wild-type mice (Q2Y=0.587 and 0.766 for PLS-DA models derived from brain and plasma, respectively). A number of metabolites were found to be perturbed in TASTPM mice in both brain (D-fructose, L-valine, L-serine, L-threonine, zymosterol) and plasma (D-glucose, D-galactose, linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, palmitic acid and D-gluconic acid). In addition, enzyme immunoassay confirmed that selected endogenous steroids were significantly perturbed in brain (androstenedione and 17-OH-progesterone) and plasma (cortisol and testosterone) of TASTPM mice. Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed that perturbations related to amino acid metabolism (brain), steroid biosynthesis (brain), linoleic acid metabolism (plasma) and energy metabolism (plasma) accounted for the differentiation of TASTPM and wild-type mice. Our results provided insights on the pathogenesis of APP-induced AD and reinforced the role of TASTPM in drug and biomarker development.

23082750|t|Potential sources of interference on Abeta immunoassays in biological samples.
23082750|a|Therapeutic products that depend on the use of an in vitro diagnostic biomarker test to confirm their effectiveness are increasingly being developed. Use of biomarkers is particularly meaningful in the context of selecting the patient population where the therapeutic treatment is believed to be efficacious (patient enrichment). Currently available 'research-use-only' assays for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis all suffer from non-analyte and analyte-specific interferences. The impact of these interferences on the outcome of the assays is not well understood. The confounding factors are hampering correct value determination in biological samples and are intrinsic to the assay concept, the assay design, the presence in the sample of heterophilic antibodies and auto-antibodies, or might be the result of the therapeutic approach. This review focuses on the importance of assay interferences and considers how these might be minimized with the final aim of making the assays more acceptable as in vitro diagnostic biomarker tests for theranostic use.

23083741|t|Transsynaptic signaling by activity-dependent cleavage of neuroligin-1.
23083741|a|Adhesive contact between pre- and postsynaptic neurons initiates synapse formation during brain development and provides a natural means of transsynaptic signaling. Numerous adhesion molecules and their role during synapse development have been described in detail. However, once established, the mechanisms of adhesive disassembly and its function in regulating synaptic transmission have been unclear. Here, we report that synaptic activity induces acute proteolytic cleavage of neuroligin-1 (NLG1), a postsynaptic adhesion molecule at glutamatergic synapses. NLG1 cleavage is triggered by NMDA receptor activation, requires Ca2+ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, and is mediated by proteolytic activity of matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP9). Cleavage of NLG1 occurs at single activated spines, is regulated by neural activity in vivo, and causes rapid destabilization of its presynaptic partner neurexin-1beta (NRX1beta). In turn, NLG1 cleavage depresses synaptic transmission by abruptly reducing presynaptic release probability. Thus, local proteolytic control of synaptic adhesion tunes synaptic transmission during brain development and plasticity.

23083742|t|Activity-dependent proteolytic cleavage of neuroligin-1.
23083742|a|Neuroligin (NLG), a postsynaptic adhesion molecule, is involved in the formation of synapses by binding to a cognate presynaptic ligand, neurexin. Here we report that neuroligin-1 (NLG1) undergoes ectodomain shedding at the juxtamembrane stalk region to generate a secreted form of NLG1 and a membrane-tethered C-terminal fragment (CTF) in adult rat brains in vivo as well as in neuronal cultures. Pharmacological and genetic studies identified ADAM10 as the major protease responsible for NLG1 shedding, the latter being augmented by synaptic NMDA receptor activation or interaction with soluble neurexin ligands. NLG1-CTF was subsequently cleaved by presenilin/gamma-secretase. Secretion of soluble NLG1 was significantly upregulated under a prolonged epileptic seizure condition, and inhibition of NLG1 shedding led to an increase in numbers of dendritic spines in neuronal cultures. Collectively, neuronal activity-dependent proteolytic processing of NLG1 may negatively regulate the remodeling of spines at excitatory synapses.

23085550|a|An automated synthesis procedure of [(18)F]Florbetaben ([(18)F]BAY94-9172), a radiolabeled imaging agent in phase III study for in vivo mapping of fibrillar amyloid beta (Abeta) with PET, was developed using the commercial PET-MF-2V-IT-1 synthesizer. The automated radiosynthesis was carried out via a one-step nucleophilic fluorination of methanesulfonic acid 2-[2-(2-{4-[2-(4-methylamino-phenyl)-vinyl]-phenoxy}-ethoxy)-ethoxy]-ethyl ester, as a new precursor, and separation with semi-preparative high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The total synthesis time amounted to 50 min with 20-25% yield (uncorrected for decay) and radiochemical purities of more than 95% in all runs. The described automated radiosynthesis allows the production of [(18)F]Florbetaben using a commercial radiosynthesis module and enables clinical trials of this compound.

23086305|t|The molecular mechanism for human metallothionein-3 to protect against the neuronal cytotoxicity of Abeta(1-42) with Cu ions.
23086305|a|Aggregation and cytotoxicity of Abeta with redox-active metals in neuronal cells have been implicated in the progression of Alzheimer disease. Human metallothionein (MT) 3 is highly expressed in the normal human brain and is downregulated in Alzheimer disease. Zn(7)MT3 can protect against the neuronal toxicity of Abeta by preventing copper-mediated Abeta aggregation, abolishing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the related cellular toxicity. In this study, we intended to decipher the roles of single-domain proteins (alpha/beta) and the alpha-beta domain-domain interaction of Zn(7)MT3 to determine the molecular mechanism for protection against the neuronal cytotoxicity of Abeta(1-42) with copper ions. With this in mind, the alpha and beta single-domain proteins, heterozygous beta(MT3)-alpha(MT1), and a linker-truncated mutant  31-34 were prepared and characterized. In the presence/absence of various Zn(7)MT3 proteins, the Abeta(1-42)-Cu(2+)-mediated aggregation, the production of ROS, and the cellular toxicity were investigated by transmission electron microscopy, ROS assay by means of a fluorescent probe, and SH-SY5Y cell viability, respectively. The beta domain cannot abolish Abeta(1-42)-Cu(2+)-induced aggregation, and neither the beta domain nor the alpha domain can quench the production of ROS because of the redox cycling of Abeta-Cu(2+). Similarly to wild-type Zn(7)MT3, the heterozygous beta(MT3)-alpha(MT1) possesses the characteristic of alleviating Abeta(1-42) aggregation and oxidative stress to neuronal cells. Therefore, the two domains through the linker Lys-Lys-Ser form a cooperative unit, and each of them is indispensable in conducting its bioactivity. The alpha domain plays an important role in modulating the stability of the metal-thiolate cluster, and the alpha-beta domain-domain interaction through the linker is critical for its protective role in the brain.

23089633|t|Associations between gonadotropins, testosterone and beta amyloid in men at risk of Alzheimer's disease.
23089633|a|Testosterone and gonadotropins have been associated with cognitive decline in men and the modulation of beta amyloid (Abeta) metabolism. The relatively few studies that have investigated whether changes in one or a combination of these hormones influence Abeta levels have focused primarily on plasma Abeta(1-40) and not on the more pathogenic Abeta(1-42). Currently, no study has investigated whether these hormones are associated with an increase in brain amyloid deposition, ante mortem. Through the highly characterised Australian imaging, biomarkers and lifestyle study, we have determined the impact of these hormones on plasma Abeta levels and brain amyloid burden (Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) retention). Spearman's rank correlation and linear regression analysis was carried out across the cohort and within subclassifications. Luteinizing hormone (LH) was the only variable shown, in the total cohort, to have a significant impact on plasma Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) levels (beta=0.163, P<0.001; beta=0.446, P<0.001). This held in subjective memory complainers (SMC) (Abeta(1-40); beta=0.208, P=0.017; Abeta(1-42); beta=0.215, P=0.017) but was absent in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) groups. In SMC, increased frequency of the APOE-e4 allele (beta=0.536, P<0.001) and increasing serum LH levels (beta=0.421, P=0.004) had a significant impact on PiB retention. Whereas in MCI, PiB retention was associated with increased APOE-e4 allele copy number (beta=0.674, P<0.001) and decreasing calculated free testosterone (beta=-0.303, P=0.043). These findings suggest a potential progressive involvement of LH and testosterone in the early preclinical stages of AD. Furthermore, these hormones should be considered while attempting to predict AD at these earliest stages of the disease.

23089868|t|Amyloid beta-sheet mimics that antagonize protein aggregation and reduce amyloid toxicity.
23089868|a|The amyloid protein aggregation associated with diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and type II diabetes (among many others) features a bewildering variety of beta-sheet-rich structures in transition from native proteins to ordered oligomers and fibres. The variation in the amino-acid sequences of the beta-structures presents a challenge to developing a model system of beta-sheets for the study of various amyloid aggregates. Here, we introduce a family of robust beta-sheet macrocycles that can serve as a platform to display a variety of heptapeptide sequences from different amyloid proteins. We have tailored these amyloid beta-sheet mimics (ABSMs) to antagonize the aggregation of various amyloid proteins, thereby reducing the toxicity of amyloid aggregates. We describe the structures and inhibitory properties of ABSMs containing amyloidogenic peptides from the amyloid-beta peptide associated with Alzheimer's disease, beta(2)-microglobulin associated with dialysis-related amyloidosis, alpha-synuclein associated with Parkinson's disease, islet amyloid polypeptide associated with type II diabetes, human and yeast prion proteins, and Tau, which forms neurofibrillary tangles.

23095848|t|Reducing available soluble beta-amyloid prevents progression of cerebral amyloid angiopathy in transgenic mice.
23095848|a|Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), the accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in the walls of leptomeningeal and cortical blood vessels of the brain, is a major cause of intracerebral hemorrhage and cognitive impairment and is commonly associated with Alzheimer disease. The progression of CAA, as measured in transgenic mice by longitudinal imaging with multiphoton microscopy, occurs in a predictable linear manner. The dynamics of Abeta deposition in and clearance from vascular walls and their relationship to the concentration of Abeta in the brain are poorly understood. We manipulated Abeta levels in the brain using 2 approaches: peripheral clearance via administration of the amyloid binding "peripheral sink" protein gelsolin and direct inhibition of its formation via administration of LY-411575, a small-molecule gamma-secretase inhibitor. We found that gelsolin and LY-411575 both reduced the rate of CAA progression in Tg2576 mice from untreated rates of 0.58% +- 0.15% and 0.52% +- 0.09% to 0.11% +- 0.18% (p = 0.04) and -0.17% +- 0.09% (p < 0.001) of affected vessel per day, respectively, in the absence of an immune response. The progression of CAA was also halted when gelsolin was combined with LY-411575 (-0.004% +- 0.10%, p < 0.003). These data suggest that CAA progression can be prevented with non-immune approaches that may reduce the availability of soluble Abeta but without evidence of substantial amyloid clearance from vessels.

23095849|t|Hippocampal proNGF signaling pathways and beta-amyloid levels in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease.
23095849|a|Hippocampal precursor of nerve growth factor (proNGF)/NGF signaling occurs in conjunction with beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulations in Alzheimer disease (AD). To assess the involvement of this pathway in AD progression, we quantified these proteins and their downstream pathway activators in postmortem tissues from the brains of subjects with no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD using immunoblotting and ELISA. Hippocampal proNGF was significantly greater in AD cases compared with those in NCI and MCI cases. TrkA was significantly reduced in MCI compared with those in NCI and AD, whereas p75 neurotrophin receptor, sortilin, and neurotrophin receptor homolog 2 remained stable. Akt decreased from NCI to MCI to AD, whereas phospho-Akt and phospho-Akt-to-Akt ratio were elevated in AD compared with those in MCI and NCI. No differences were found in phospho-Erk, Erk, or their ratio across groups. Although c-jun kinase (JNK) remained stable across groups, phospho-JNK and the phospho-JNK-to-JNK ratio increased significantly in AD compared with those in NCI and MCI. Expression levels of Abeta(1-40), Abeta(1-42), and Abeta(40/42) ratio were stable. Statistical analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between proNGF and phospho-JNK, although only proNGF was negatively correlated with cognitive function and only TrkA was negatively associated with pathologic criteria. These findings suggest that alterations in the hippocampal NGF signaling pathway in MCI and AD favor proNGF-mediated proapoptotic pathways, and that this is independent of Abeta accumulation during AD progression.

23098038|t|Identification of small molecule inhibitors of amyloid beta-induced neuronal apoptosis acting through the imidazoline I(2) receptor.
23098038|a|Aberrant activation of signaling pathways plays a pivotal role in central nervous system disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using a combination of virtual screening and experimental testing, novel small molecule inhibitors of tPA-mediated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk)1/2 activation were identified that provide higher levels of neuroprotection from Abeta-induced apoptosis than Memantine, the most recently FDA-approved drug for AD treatment. Subsequent target deconvolution efforts revealed that they all share low micromolar affinity for the imidazoline I(2) receptor, while being devoid of any significant affinity to a list of AD-relevant targets, including the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B). Targeting the imidazoline I(2) receptor emerges as a new mechanism of action to inhibit tPA-induced signaling in neurons for the treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

23098125|t|Vitamin D mitigates age-related cognitive decline through the modulation of pro-inflammatory state and decrease in amyloid burden.
23098125|a|BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence shows an association between the use of vitamin D and improvement in age-related cognitive decline. In this study, we investigated the possible mechanisms involved in the neuroprotective effects of vitamin D on age-related brain changes and cognitive function. METHODS: Male F344 rats aged 20 months (old) and 6 months (young) were used and randomly assigned to either vitamin D supplementation or no supplementation (control). A total of n = 39 rats were used in the study. Rats were individually housed and the supplementation group received a subcutaneous injection of vitamin D (1, alpha25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) 42 I.U./Kg for 21 days. Control animals received equal volume of normal saline. Behavioral testing in water maze and spontaneous object recognition tasks started on day 14. Levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-10 were quantified to assess inflammatory state. Also, beta amyloid (Abeta) clearance and Abeta load were measured. RESULTS: Our results show that: (1) aged rats demonstrated significant learning and memory impairment overall compared to younger animals. However, the age-related decline in learning and memory was ameliorated by the supplementation of vitamin D. No vitamin D effect on learning and memory was seen in the young animals; 2) the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1beta is significantly increased while the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 is significantly decreased in the aged rats compared to the young animals; but this age-related change in inflammatory state was mitigated by vitamin D supplementation. No effects of vitamin D were seen on the IL-1beta and IL-10 expression in the young rats; (3) vitamin D increased Abeta clearance and decreased amyloid burden in the aged rats while no significant difference was seen between the young animal groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that vitamin D supplementation modulated age-related increase in pro-inflammatory state and amyloid burden. It is possible that these effects of vitamin D mediated the decrease memory impairment seen in the aged rats making it a useful therapeutic option to alleviate the effects of aging on cognitive function.

23100049|t|Comparison of the binding characteristics of [18F]THK-523 and other amyloid imaging tracers to Alzheimer's disease pathology.
23100049|a|PURPOSE: Extensive deposition of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although several PET imaging agents have been developed for in vivo detection of senile plaques, no PET probe is currently available for selective detection of neurofibrillary tangles in the living human brain. Recently, [(18)F]THK-523 was developed as a potential in vivo imaging probe for tau pathology. The purpose of this study was to compare the binding properties of [(18)F]THK-523 and other amyloid imaging agents, including PiB, BF-227 and FDDNP, to synthetic protein fibrils and human brain tissue. METHODS: In vitro radioligand binding assays were conducted using synthetic amyloid beta(42) and K18DeltaK280-tau fibrils. Nonspecific binding was determined by the addition of unlabelled compounds at a concentration of 2 muM. To examine radioligand binding to neuropathological lesions, in vitro autoradiography was conducted using sections of AD brain. RESULTS: [(18)F]THK-523 showed higher affinity for tau fibrils than for Abeta fibrils, whereas the other probes showed a higher affinity for Abeta fibrils. The autoradiographic analysis indicated that [(18)F]THK-523 accumulated in the regions containing a high density of tau protein deposits. Conversely, PiB and BF-227 accumulated in the regions containing a high density of Abeta plaques. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the unique binding profile of [(18)F]THK-523 can be used to identify tau deposits in AD brain.

23100439|t|Apolipoprotein E, especially apolipoprotein E4, increases the oligomerization of amyloid beta peptide.
23100439|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common progressive neurodegenerative disorder causing dementia. Massive deposition of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) as senile plaques in the brain is the pathological hallmark of AD, but oligomeric, soluble forms of Abeta have been implicated as the synaptotoxic component. The apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 (apoE epsilon4) allele is known to be a genetic risk factor for developing AD. However, it is still unknown how apoE impacts the process of Abeta oligomerization. Here, we found that the level of Abeta oligomers in APOE epsilon4/epsilon4 AD patient brains is 2.7 times higher than those in APOE epsilon3/epsilon3 AD patient brains, matched for total plaque burden, suggesting that apoE4 impacts the metabolism of Abeta oligomers. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of apoE on Abeta oligomer formation. Using both synthetic Abeta and a split-luciferase method for monitoring Abeta oligomers, we observed that apoE increased the level of Abeta oligomers in an isoform-dependent manner (E2 < E3 < E4). This effect appears to be dependent on the ApoE C-terminal domain. Moreover, these results were confirmed using endogenous apoE isolated from the TBS-soluble fraction of human brain, which increased the formation of Abeta oligomers. Together, these data show that lipidated apoE, especially apoE4, increases Abeta oligomers in the brain. Higher levels of Abeta oligomers in the brains of APOE epsilon4/epsilon4 carriers compared with APOE epsilon3/epsilon3 carriers may increase the loss of dendritic spines and accelerate memory impairments, leading to earlier cognitive decline in AD.

23100443|t|Systematic mutagenesis of alpha-synuclein reveals distinct sequence requirements for physiological and pathological activities.
23100443|a|alpha-Synuclein is an abundant presynaptic protein that binds to phospholipids and synaptic vesicles. Physiologically, alpha-synuclein functions as a SNARE-protein chaperone that promotes SNARE-complex assembly for neurotransmitter release. Pathologically, alpha-synuclein mutations and alpha-synuclein overexpression cause Parkinson's disease, and aggregates of alpha-synuclein are found as Lewy bodies in multiple neurodegenerative disorders ("synucleinopathies"). The relation of the physiological functions to the pathological effects of alpha-synuclein remains unclear. As an initial avenue of addressing this question, we here systematically examined the effect of alpha-synuclein mutations on its physiological and pathological activities. We generated 26 alpha-synuclein mutants spanning the entire molecule, and analyzed them compared with wild-type alpha-synuclein in seven assays that range from biochemical studies with purified alpha-synuclein, to analyses of alpha-synuclein expression in cultured neurons, to examinations of the effects of virally expressed alpha-synuclein introduced into the mouse substantia nigra by stereotactic injections. We found that both the N-terminal and C-terminal sequences of alpha-synuclein were required for its physiological function as SNARE-complex chaperone, but that these sequences were not essential for its neuropathological effects. In contrast, point mutations in the central region of alpha-synuclein, referred to as nonamyloid beta component (residues 61-95), as well as point mutations linked to Parkinson's disease (A30P, E46K, and A53T) increased the neurotoxicity of alpha-synuclein but did not affect its physiological function in SNARE-complex assembly. Thus, our data show that the physiological function of alpha-synuclein, although protective of neurodegeneration in some contexts, is fundamentally distinct from its neuropathological effects, thereby dissociating the two activities of alpha-synuclein.

23101885|t|Dynamical stability and assembly cooperativity of beta-sheet amyloid oligomers--effect of polarization.
23101885|a|The soluble intermediate oligomers of amyloidogenic proteins are suspected to be more cytotoxic than the mature fibrils in neurodegenerative disorders. Here, the dynamic stability and assembly cooperativity of a model oligomer of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) segments were explored by means of all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations under different force fields including AMBER99SB, OPLS, and polarized protein-specific charge (PPC) model. Simulation results show that the dynamic stability of beta-sheet oligomers is seriously impacted by electrostatic polarization. Without inclusion of polarization (simulation under standard AMBER and OPLS force field), the beta-sheet oligomers are dynamically unstable during MD simulation. For comparison, simulation results under PPC give significantly more stable dynamical structures of the oligomers. Furthermore, calculation of electrostatic interaction energy between the neighboring beta strands with an approximate polarizable method produces energetic evidence for cooperative assembly of beta-strand oligomers. This result supports a picture of downhill-like cooperative assembly of beta strands during fibrillation process. The present study demonstrates the critical role of polarization in dynamic stability and assembly cooperativity of beta-sheet-rich amyloid oligomers.

23102118|t|Cardiovascular risk factors, cortisol, and amyloid-beta deposition in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.
23102118|a|BACKGROUND: There is epidemiological evidence that cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) also are risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, but there is limited information on this from neuropathological studies, and even less from in vivo studies. Therefore, we examined the relationship between CVRF and amyloid-beta (Abeta) brain burden measured by Pittsburgh Compound B-positron emission tomography (PiB-PET) studies in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. METHODS: Ninety-nine subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort who had a PiB-PET study measure, apolipoprotein E genotyping data, and information available on CVRF (body mass index [BMI], systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure [DBP], and cholesterol and fasting glucose test results) were included. Eighty-one subjects also had plasma cortisol, C-reactive protein, and superoxide dismutase 1 measurements. Stepwise regression models were used to assess the relation between the CVRF and the composite PiB-PET score. RESULTS: The first model included the following as baseline variables: age, clinical diagnosis, number of apolipoprotein e4 alleles, BMI (P = .023), and DBP (P = .012). BMI showed an inverse relation with PiB-PET score, and DBP had a positive relation with PiB-PET score. In the second adjusted model, cortisol plasma levels were also associated with PiB-PET score (P = .004). Systolic blood pressure, cholesterol, or impaired fasting glucose were not found to be associated with PiB-PET values. CONCLUSION: In this cross-sectional study, we found an association between Abeta brain burden measured in vivo and DBP and cortisol, indicating a possible link between these CVRF and Abeta burden measured by PiB-PET. These findings highlight the utility of biomarkers to explore potential pathways linking diverse Alzheimer's disease risk factors.

23102120|t|Imaging brain amyloid in nondemented young adults with Down syndrome using Pittsburgh compound B.
23102120|a|Down syndrome (DS) is one of the most common causes of intellectual disability. Although DS accounts for only 15% of all individuals with intellectual disabilities, adults with DS account for approximately 60% of individuals with intellectual disabilities and Alzheimer's disease. This is thought to be because of overproduction of the beta-amyloid (Abeta) protein due to trisomy for the Abeta precursor protein gene on chromosome 21. Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) is a noninvasive in vivo positron emission tomography tracer used to image amyloid deposition in living humans. Studies using PiB have shown an age-dependent asymptomatic amyloid deposition in more than 20% of the cognitively normal elderly population. Presymptomatic carriers of presenilin (PS-1) and Abeta precursor protein gene mutations who are destined to develop Alzheimer's disease also show preclinical amyloid deposition. This report describes a pilot study involving the use of PiB in seven adults with DS (age: 20-44 years). Compared with objective cutoffs for amyloid positivity in older non-DS cognitively normal control subjects, only two of the seven DS subjects (age: 38 and 44 years) showed increased PiB retention. The remaining five subjects aged between 20 and 35 years showed no detectable increase in PiB retention. Interestingly, the two subjects who showed elevated PiB retention showed a striatal-predominant pattern similar to that previously reported for PS-1 mutation carriers. These results demonstrate the feasibility of conducting PiB positron emission tomography scanning in this special population, and suggest a link between Abeta overproduction and early striatal deposition of fibrillar Abeta.

23104436|t|Functional and structural effects of amyloid-beta aggregate on Xenopus laevis oocytes.
23104436|a|Xenopus laevis oocytes exposed to amyloid-beta aggregate generated oscillatory electric activity (blips) that was recorded by two-microelectrode voltage-clamp. The cells exhibited a series of "spontaneous" blips ranging in amplitude from 3.8 +- 0.9 nA at the beginning of the recordings to 6.8 +- 1.7 nA after 15 min of exposure to 1 muM aggregate. These blips were similar in amplitude to those induced by the channel-forming antimicrobial agents amphotericin B (7.8 +- 1.2 nA) and gramicidin (6.3 +- 1.1 nA). The amyloid aggregate-induced currents were abolished when extracellular Ca(2+) was removed from the bathing solution, suggesting a central role for this cation in generating the spontaneous electric activity. The amyloid aggregate also affected the Ca(2+)-dependent Cl(-) currents of oocytes, as shown by increased amplitude of the transient-outward chloride current (T(out)) and the serum-activated, oscillatory Cl(-) currents. Electron microcopy revealed that amyloid aggregate induced the dissociation of the follicular cells that surround the oocyte, thus leading to a failure in the electro-chemical communication between these cells. This was also evidenced by the suppression of the oscillatory Ca(2+)-dependent ATP-currents, which require proper coupling between oocytes and the follicular cell layer. These observations, made using the X. laevis oocytes as a versatile experimental model, may help to understand the effects of amyloid aggregate on cellular communication.

23105112|t|The effects of transmembrane sequence and dimerization on cleavage of the p75 neurotrophin receptor by gamma-secretase.
23105112|a|Cleavage of transmembrane receptors by gamma-secretase is the final step in the process of regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) and has a significant impact on receptor function. Although relatively little is known about the molecular mechanism of gamma-secretase enzymatic activity, it is becoming clear that substrate dimerization and/or the alpha-helical structure of the substrate can regulate the site and rate of gamma-secretase activity. Here we show that the transmembrane domain of the pan-neurotrophin receptor p75(NTR), best known for regulating neuronal death, is sufficient for its homodimerization. Although the p75(NTR) ligands NGF and pro-NGF do not induce homerdimerization or RIP, homodimers of p75(NTR) are gamma-secretase substrates. However, dimerization is not a requirement for p75(NTR) cleavage, suggesting that gamma-secretase has the ability to recognize and cleave each receptor molecule independently. The transmembrane cysteine 257, which mediates covalent p75(NTR) interactions, is not crucial for homodimerization, but this residue is required for normal rates of gamma-secretase cleavage. Similarly, mutation of the residues alanine 262 and glycine 266 of an AXXXG dimerization motif flanking the gamma-secretase cleavage site within the p75(NTR) transmembrane domain alters the orientation of the domain and inhibits gamma-secretase cleavage of p75(NTR). Nonetheless, heteromer interactions of p75(NTR) with TrkA increase full-length p75(NTR) homodimerization, which in turn potentiates the rate of gamma-cleavage following TrkA activation independently of rates of alpha-cleavage. These results provide support for the idea that the helical structure of the p75(NTR) transmembrane domain, which may be affected by co-receptor interactions, is a key element in gamma-secretase-catalyzed cleavage.

23106396|t|Amyloid-beta oligomers are sequestered by both intracellular and extracellular chaperones.
23106396|a|The aberrant aggregation of the amyloid-beta peptide into beta-sheet rich, fibrillar structures proceeds via a heterogeneous ensemble of oligomeric intermediates that have been associated with neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Of particular interest in this context are the mechanisms by which molecular chaperones, part of the primary biological defenses against protein misfolding, influence Abeta aggregation. We have used single-molecule fluorescence techniques to compare the interactions between distinct aggregation states (monomers, oligomers, and amyloid fibrils) of the AD-associated amyloid-beta(1-40) peptide, and two molecular chaperones, both of which are upregulated in the brains of patients with AD and have been found colocalized with Abeta in senile plaques. One of the chaperones, alphaB-crystallin, is primarily found inside cells, while the other, clusterin, is predominantly located in the extracellular environment. We find that both chaperones bind to misfolded oligomeric species and form long-lived complexes, thereby preventing both their further growth into fibrils and their dissociation. From these studies, we conclude that these chaperones have a common mechanism of action based on sequestering Abeta oligomers. This conclusion suggests that these chaperones, both of which are ATP-independent, are able to inhibit potentially pathogenic Abeta oligomer-associated processes whether they occur in the extracellular or intracellular environment.

23108486|t|Scavenger receptor A deficiency accelerates cerebrovascular amyloidosis in an animal model.
23108486|a|Cerebrovascular amyloidosis caused by amyloid accumulation in blood vessel walls may lead to hemorrhagic stroke and cognitive impairment. Expression of TGF-beta1 under glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter in mice leads to age-related deposition of amyloid, including beta-amyloid (Abeta), around cerebral blood vessels, leading to vascular pathology starting at age of 7 months. We have recently shown the important role of macrophages in clearing cerebrovascular amyloid. Scavenger receptor A (SRA) is a multi-ligand and multifunctional receptor expressed on macrophages, and it has been suggested to play a role in meditating phagocytosis of different types of antigens. We investigated the role of SRA in mediating cerebrovascular amyloid clearance. We bred TGF-beta1 mice with SRA(-/-) mice and discovered that TGF-beta1/SRA(-/-) mice showed cerebrovascular pathology at an earlier age (3 months) compared with TGF-beta1 mice. Furthermore, SRA deficiency in macrophages led to impaired clearing of congophilic cerebrovascular amyloid from amyloid precursor protein mouse model and led to reduced phagocytosis of both soluble and insoluble Abeta in vivo as compared with macrophages from wild-type mice. Our findings demonstrate the important role of SRA in cerebrovascular amyloid pathology and suggest targeting SRA for future diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for cerebral amyloid angiopathy.

23109151|t|Pittsburgh compound B and the postmortem diagnosis of Alzheimer disease.
23109151|a|OBJECTIVE: Deposition of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide in neuritic plaques is a requirement for the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD). Although the continued development of in vivo imaging agents such as Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) is promising, the diagnosis of AD is still challenging. This can be partially attributed to our lack of a detailed understanding of the interrelationship between the various pools and species of Abeta and other common indices of AD pathology. We hypothesized that recent advances in our ability to accurately measure Abeta postmortem (for example, using PiB), could form the basis of a simple means to deliver an accurate AD diagnosis. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the amount of Abeta40 and Abeta42 in increasingly insoluble fractions, oligomeric Abeta, and fibrillar Abeta (as defined by PiB binding), as well as plaques (diffuse and neuritic), and neurofibrillary tangles in autopsy specimens from age-matched, cognitively normal controls (n = 23) and AD (n = 22) cases, across multiple brain regions. RESULTS: Both PiB binding and the amount of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-soluble Abeta were able to predict disease status; however, SDS-soluble Abeta was a better measure. Oligomeric Abeta was not a predictor of disease status. PiB binding was strongly related to plaque count, although diffuse plaques were a stronger correlate than neuritic plaques. INTERPRETATION: Although postmortem PiB binding was somewhat useful in distinguishing AD from control cases, SDS-soluble Abeta measured by standard immunoassay was substantially better. These findings have important implications for the development of imaging-based biomarkers of AD.

23109152|t|Alzheimer disease family history impacts resting state functional connectivity.
23109152|a|OBJECTIVE: Offspring whose parents have Alzheimer disease (AD) are at increased risk for developing dementia. Patients with AD typically exhibit disruptions in the default mode network (DMN). The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a family history of late onset AD on DMN integrity in cognitively normal individuals. In particular, we determined whether a family history effect is detectable in apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele noncarriers. METHODS: We studied a cohort of 348 cognitively normal participants with or without family history of late onset AD. DMN integrity was assessed by resting state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: A family history of late onset AD was associated with reduced resting state functional connectivity between particular nodes of the DMN, namely the posterior cingulate and medial temporal cortex. The observed functional connectivity reduction was not attributable to medial temporal structural atrophy. Importantly, we detected a family history effect on DMN functional connectivity in APOE epsilon4 allele noncarriers. INTERPRETATION: Unknown genetic factors, embodied in a family history of late onset AD, may affect DMN integrity prior to cognitive impairment.

23109153|t|Amyloid deposition, hypometabolism, and longitudinal cognitive decline.
23109153|a|OBJECTIVE: Using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) population, we examined (1) cross-sectional relationships between amyloid deposition, hypometabolism, and cognition, and (2) associations between amyloid and hypometabolism measurements and longitudinal cognitive measurements. METHODS: We examined associations between mean cortical florbetapir uptake, mean (18) F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) within a set of predefined regions, and Alzhiemer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog) performance in 426 ADNI participants (126 normal, 162 early mild cognitive impairment [EMCI], 85 late MCI [LMCI], 53 Alzheimer disease [AD] patients). For a subset of these (76 normal, 81 LMCI) we determined whether florbetapir and FDG-PET were associated with retrospective decline in longitudinal ADAS-cog measurements. RESULTS: Twenty-nine percent of normal subjects, 43% of EMCI patients, 62% of LMCI patients, and 77% of AD patients were categorized as florbetapir positive. Florbetapir was negatively associated with concurrent FDG and ADAS-cog in both MCI groups. In longitudinal analyses, florbetapir-positive subjects in both normal and LMCI groups had greater ongoing ADAS-cog decline than those who were florbetapir negative. However, in normal subjects, florbetapir positivity was associated with greater ADAS-cog decline than FDG, whereas in LMCI, FDG positivity was associated with greater decline than florbetapir. INTERPRETATION: Although both hypometabolism and beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition are detectable in normal subjects and all diagnostic groups, Abeta showed greater associations with cognitive decline in normal participants. In view of the minimal cognitive deterioration overall in this group, this suggests that amyloid deposition has an early and subclinical impact on cognition that precedes metabolic changes. At moderate and later stages of disease (LMCI/AD), hypometabolism becomes more pronounced and more closely linked to ongoing cognitive decline.

23109154|t|Relation of neuropathology to cognition in persons without cognitive impairment.
23109154|a|OBJECTIVE: A study was undertaken to examine the relation of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology, cerebral infarcts, and Lewy body (LB) pathology to cognition in persons without cognitive impairment. METHODS: Persons without dementia from 2 cohort studies of aging, the Religious Orders Study and the Memory and Aging Project, agreed to annual clinical evaluation and brain donation. The studies had 19 neuropsychological performance tests in common that assessed 5 cognitive domains. For 296 persons without cognitive impairment who died and underwent postmortem assessment, we quantified AD pathology as a global pathology score, and as amyloid load, paired helical filament tau-positive (PHFtau) tangle density, cerebral infarcts, and LB pathology. Linear regression was used to examine the relation of neuropathology to cognitive abilities, controlling for demographics. RESULTS: Nearly all persons had AD pathology with >3/4 exhibiting amyloid; 22% had macroscopic and 24% had microscopic infarctions, and 13% had LB pathology. The global measure of AD pathology was related to global cognition (p = 0.008), whereas infarcts and Lewy bodies were not. Amyloid load was related to global cognition (p < 0.05), with only a trend for tangles (p = 0.08). In analyses of cognitive domains, AD pathology (p = 0.006), PHFtau tangles (p = 0.03), and macroscopic infarctions (p = 0.02) were related to episodic memory, with a trend for amyloid load (p = 0.06); AD pathology (p = 0.02) and amyloid load (p = 0.03) were related to working memory. Findings for global cognition and episodic memory were stronger in additional analyses with neocortical amyloid and mesial temporal tangles. INTERPRETATION: AD pathology and macroscopic infarctions are common in older persons without cognitive impairment and are related to episodic and working memory.

23110868|t|The influence of insulin infusion on the metabolism of amyloid beta peptides in plasma.
23110868|a|BACKGROUND: Accumulating body of evidence suggests pathophysiologic links between Alzheimer's disease and diabetes mellitus (DM). For example, the two crucial peptides playing a role in both degenerative disorders, amyloid beta (Abeta) and insulin, are metabolized by the same enzyme, insulin degrading enzyme. Euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp is a method of estimating insulin sensitivity, based on the assumption that during steady-state hyperinsulinemic euglycemia, glucose infusion rate equals tissue glucose uptake, that is, the higher the glucose infusion rate, the higher the insulin sensitivity. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of insulin on the plasma concentrations of Abeta peptides. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 20 healthy young male volunteers before insulin infusion (clamp) and then at 120 and 360 minutes. In the second protocol, insulin was accompanied by Intralipid, which is mainly a mixture of triacylglycerols, and heparin, given as an activator of lipoprotein lipase, inducing insulin resistance. Analyses of plasma Abeta1-42, Abetax-42, Abeta1-40, and Abetax-40 were performed with multiplexing technology. Furthermore, concentrations of the Abeta peptides in healthy persons were compared with those in 16 type 1 DM patients receiving chronic insulin therapy. RESULTS: When applied alone (i.e., without Intralipid), insulin infusion increased concentrations of Abeta42 (full length and N-terminally shortened) but not of Abeta40. When combined with Intralipid, infusion of insulin resulted in increased concentrations of all peptides (nonsignificant tendency in case of Abetax-40). We did not observe differences between Abeta peptide concentrations in healthy subjects and those in type 1 DM patients. CONCLUSION: Infusion of insulin in nonphysiologic high doses increases plasma concentrations of Abeta peptides; in case of Abeta40, only when applied together with Intralipid, which perhaps might be explained by hypothetical shift of insulin degrading enzyme activity from degradation of Abeta peptides to the degradation of insulin.

23115236|t|The heat shock response is modulated by and interferes with toxic effects of scrapie prion protein and amyloid beta.
23115236|a|The heat shock response (HSR) is an evolutionarily conserved pathway designed to maintain proteostasis and to ameliorate toxic effects of aberrant protein folding. We have studied the modulation of the HSR by the scrapie prion protein (PrP(Sc)) and amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) and investigated whether an activated HSR or the ectopic expression of individual chaperones can interfere with PrP(Sc)- or Abeta-induced toxicity. First, we observed different effects on the HSR under acute or chronic exposure of cells to PrP(Sc) or Abeta. In chronically exposed cells the threshold to mount a stress response was significantly increased, evidenced by a decreased expression of Hsp72 after stress, whereas an acute exposure lowered the threshold for stress-induced expression of Hsp72. Next, we employed models of PrP(Sc)- and Abeta-induced toxicity to demonstrate that the induction of the HSR ameliorates the toxic effects of both PrP(Sc) and Abeta. Similarly, the ectopic expression of cytosolic Hsp72 or the extracellular chaperone clusterin protected against PrP(Sc)- or Abeta-induced toxicity. However, toxic signaling induced by a pathogenic PrP mutant located at the plasma membrane was prevented by an activated HSR or Hsp72 but not by clusterin, indicating a distinct mode of action of this extracellular chaperone. Our study supports the notion that different pathological protein conformers mediate toxic effects via similar cellular pathways and emphasizes the possibility to exploit the heat shock response therapeutically.

23116141|t|Side-chain dynamics reveals transient association of Abeta(1-40) monomers with amyloid fibers.
23116141|a|Low-lying excited states that correspond to rare conformations or transiently bound species have been hypothesized to play an important role for amyloid nucleation. Despite their hypothesized importance in amyloid formation, transiently occupied states have proved difficult to detect directly. To experimentally characterize these invisible states, we performed a series of Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG)-based relaxation dispersion NMR experiments for the amyloidogenic Abeta(1-40) peptide implicated in Alzheimer's disease. Significant relaxation dispersion of the resonances corresponding to the side-chain amides of Q15 and N27 was detected before the onset of aggregation. The resonances corresponding to the peptide backbone did not show detectable relaxation dispersion, suggesting an exchange rate that is not within the practical limit of detection. This finding is consistent with the proposed "dock and lock" mechanism based on molecular dynamics simulations in which the Abeta(1-40) monomer transiently binds to the Abeta(1-40) oligomer by non-native contacts with the side chains before being incorporated into the fiber through native contacts with the peptide backbone.

23117496|t|Cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta and phenotypic heterogeneity in de novo Parkinson's disease.
23117496|a|BACKGROUND: In Parkinson's disease (PD), the motor presentation characterised by postural instability/gait difficulties (PIGD) heralds accelerated motor, functional and cognitive decline, as compared with the more benign tremor-dominant (TD) variant. This makes the PIGD complex an attractive target for the discovery of prognostic biomarkers in PD. OBJECTIVE: To explore in vivo whether variability in brain amyloid-beta (Abeta) metabolism affects the initial motor presentation in PD. METHODS: We quantified cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations and ratios of Abeta42, Abeta40 and Abeta38 using a triplex immunoassay in 99 patients with de novo PD with the PIGD phenotype (n=39) or the TD phenotype (n=60). All patients underwent standardised assessments of motor and neuropsychological function and cerebral MRI. 46 age-matched normal controls served as external reference. RESULTS: Patients with PD with the PIGD phenotype had significantly reduced CSF Abeta42, Abeta38, Abeta42/40 and Abeta38/40 levels compared with patients with the TD phenotype and controls. CSF marker levels in patients with PD-TD did not differ from those in controls. Multivariate regression models demonstrated significant associations of CSF Abeta markers with severity of PIGD and lower limb bradykinesia in patients with PD, independently from age, MRI white matter hyperintensities and cognition. No associations were found between CSF markers and other motor features. CONCLUSIONS: Motor heterogeneity in de novo PD independently relates to CSF Abeta markers, with low levels found in patients with the PIGD presentation. This suggests that disturbed Abeta metabolism has an effect on PD beyond cognition and may contribute to the variable rate of motor and functional decline in PD.

23123227|t|Apolipoprotein E genotype, dementia, and mortality in the oldest old: the 90+ Study.
23123227|a|BACKGROUND: Although the apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele is a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), it is not clear whether this relationship persists among the oldest old. Several European studies suggest that the effect of the APOE epsilon4 allele on dementia and mortality disappears in very old age. We describe the APOE allele and genotype frequencies and examine whether the presence of the APOE epsilon4 or APOE epsilon2 alleles is related to prevalent dementia, incident dementia, and mortality in a population-based cohort of oldest-old participants in the United States. METHODS: We studied 904 participants aged 90 years and older from The 90+ Study. Eight hundred two (89%) participants were genotyped and included in the prevalent dementia and mortality analyses. The 520 initially nondemented participants were included in the incident dementia analyses and were evaluated for dementia every 6 months. RESULTS: The APOE epsilon4 allele was significantly associated with prevalent dementia (odds ratio = 2.06) and AD (odds ratio = 2.37) in women but not in men. The APOE epsilon2 allele was not related to prevalent dementia in either sex. After an average follow-up of 2.4 years, 188 incident dementia cases were identified. Neither the APOE epsilon4 nor the APOE epsilon2 allele was related to incident dementia or AD. Five hundred ten (64%) participants died after an average follow-up of 2.3 years, and their mortality was not related to the presence of either the APOE epsilon2 or APOE epsilon4 allele. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the associations between APOE epsilon4, dementia, and mortality are age dependent, and that APOE epsilon4 no longer plays a role in dementia and mortality at very old ages.

23123231|t|A prediction model to calculate probability of Alzheimer's disease using cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers.
23123231|a|BACKGROUND: We aimed to develop a prediction model based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, that would yield a single estimate representing the probability that dementia in a memory clinic patient is due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: All patients suspected of dementia in whom the CSF biomarkers had been analyzed were selected from a memory clinic database. Clinical diagnosis was AD (n = 272) or non-AD (n = 289). The prediction model was developed with logistic regression analysis and included CSF amyloid beta42, CSF phosphorylated tau181, and sex. Validation was performed on an independent data set from another memory clinic, containing 334 AD and 157 non-AD patients. RESULTS: The prediction model estimated the probability that AD is present as follows: p(AD) = 1/(1 + e (- [-0.3315 + score])), where score is calculated from -1.9486 x ln(amyloid beta42) + 2.7915 x ln(phosphorylated tau181) + 0.9178 x sex (male = 0, female = 1). When applied to the validation data set, the discriminative ability of the model was very good (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.85). The agreement between the probability of AD predicted by the model and the observed frequency of AD diagnoses was very good after taking into account the difference in AD prevalence between the two memory clinics. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a prediction model that can accurately predict the probability of AD in a memory clinic population suspected of dementia based on CSF amyloid beta42, CSF phosphorylated tau181, and sex.

23123349|a|Alzheimer's disease pathomimetic toxicity could be induced in mice within one week after the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of an aggregated preparation of the highly toxic and endogenous amyloid-beta fragment Abeta(25-35). It was recently reported that Abeta(25-35) also provokes a modification of APP processing with accumulation of endogenous Abeta(1-42). We here analyzed whether a gamma-secretase inhibitor, BMS-299897, attenuated this Abeta(25-35)-induced Abeta(1-42) seeding and toxicity. The compound was administered at 0.1-1 nmol/mouse, concomittantly with Abeta(25-35) (9 nmol) in male Swiss mice. After one week, the contents in Abeta(1-42) and Abeta(1-40), and the levels in lipid peroxidation were analyzed in the mouse hippocampus. Mice were submitted to spontaneous alternation, passive avoidance and object recognition to analyze their short- and long-term memory abilities. Abeta(25-35) increased Abeta(1-42) content (+240%) but failed to affect Abeta(1-40). BMS-299897 blocked the increase in Abeta(1-42) content and decreased Abeta(1-40) levels significantly. The compound did not affect Abeta(25-35)-induced increase in hippocampal lipid peroxidation. Behaviorally, BMS-299897 blocked the Abeta(25-35)-induced deficits in spontaneous alternation or novel object recognition, using a 1h intertrial time interval. BMS-299896 failed to affect the passive avoidance impairments or novel object recognition, using a 24h intertrial time interval. These results confirmed that Abeta(25-35) injection provoked an accumulation in endogenous Abeta(1-42), an effect blocked by gamma-secretase inhibition. This Abeta(1-42) accumulation marginally contributed to the toxicity or long-term memory deficits. However, since the seeded Abeta(1-42) affected short-term memory, the rapid Abeta(25-35) injection Alzheimer's disease model could be used to screen the activity of new secretase inhibitors.

23127467|t|beta-Site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 activity is related to cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of sortilin-related receptor with A-type repeats, soluble amyloid precursor protein, and tau.
23127467|a|BACKGROUND: beta-Site amyloid precursor protein (APP)-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) activity determines the rate of APP cleavage and is therefore the main driver of amyloid beta production, which is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: The present study explored the correlation between BACE1 activity and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of APP metabolism and axonal degeneration in 63 patients with mild AD and 12 healthy control subjects. RESULTS: In the AD group, positive correlations between BACE1 activity and soluble APP beta, the APP sorting receptor sortilin-related receptor with A-type repeats (also known as SorLA or LR11), and tau were detected. BACE1 activity was not associated with amyloid beta1-42 or soluble APP alpha concentrations in the AD group, and no associations between BACE1 activity and any of the protein concentrations were found in the control group. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm the relevance of BACE1 and sortilin-related receptor with A-type repeats within the amyloid cascade and also provide a further piece of evidence for the link between amyloid and tau pathology in AD.

23129766|t|The ubiquitin ligase synoviolin up-regulates amyloid beta production by targeting a negative regulator of gamma-secretase, Rer1, for degradation.
23129766|a|Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the deposition of Abeta, which is generated from the amyloid precursor protein through its cleavage by beta- and gamma-secretases. The gamma-secretase complex component nicastrin (NCT) plays significant roles in the assembly and proper trafficking of the gamma-secretase complex and in the recognition of amyloid precursor protein. NCT is incorporated into the gamma-secretase complex in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and glycosylated in the Golgi. In contrast, unassembled NCT is retrieved or retained in the ER by the protein Retention in endoplasmic reticulum 1 (Rer1). We reported previously that synoviolin (Syvn), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, degrades NCT and affects the generation of Abeta. Here, we examined in more detail the effect of Syvn on the generation of Abeta. We found that overexpression of a dominant negative form of Syvn (C307A mutant) and a Syvn-RNAi decreased the generation of Abeta. These results indicate that the ubiquitin ligase activity of Syvn up-regulates the generation of Abeta. We hypothesized, therefore, that Syvn regulates the assembly or localization of the gamma-secretase complex by ubiquitinating Rer1, resulting in its subsequent degradation. Our findings that the level of Rer1 was increased in Syvn knockout fibroblasts because of inhibition of its degradation support this hypothesis. Moreover, we found that Rer1 interacts with Syvn in the ER, is ubiquitinated by Syvn, and is then degraded via the proteasome or lysosomal pathways. Finally, we showed that localization of mature NCT to the plasma membrane as well as gamma-secretase complex levels are decreased in fibroblasts of Syvn knockout mice. Thus, it is likely that Syvn regulates the assembly of the gamma-secretase complex via the degradation of Rer1, which results in the generation of Abeta.

23129776|t|The exosome secretory pathway transports amyloid precursor protein carboxyl-terminal fragments from the cell into the brain extracellular space.
23129776|a|In vitro studies have shown that neuronal cell cultures secrete exosomes containing amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) and the APP-processing products, C-terminal fragments (CTFs) and amyloid-beta (Abeta). We investigated the secretion of full-length APP (flAPP) and APP CTFs via the exosome secretory pathway in vivo. To this end, we developed a novel protocol designed to isolate exosomes secreted into mouse brain extracellular space. Exosomes with typical morphology were isolated from freshly removed mouse brains and from frozen mouse and human brain tissues, demonstrating that exosomes can be isolated from post-mortem tissue frozen for long periods of time. flAPP, APP CTFs, and enzymes that cleave both flAPP and APP CTFs were identified in brain exosomes. Although higher levels of both flAPP and APP CTFs were observed in exosomes isolated from the brains of transgenic mice overexpressing human APP (Tg2576) compared with wild-type control mice, there was no difference in the number of secreted brain exosomes. These data indicate that the levels of flAPP and APP CTFs associated with exosomes mirror the cellular levels of flAPP and APP CTFs. Interestingly, exosomes isolated from the brains of both Tg2576 and wild-type mice are enriched with APP CTFs relative to flAPP. Thus, we hypothesize that the exosome secretory pathway plays a pleiotropic role in the brain: exosome secretion is beneficial to the cell, acting as a specific releasing system of neurotoxic APP CTFs and Abeta, but the secretion of exosomes enriched with APP CTFs, neurotoxic proteins that are also a source of secreted Abeta, is harmful to the brain.

23131555|t|Solid-state NMR analysis of the beta-strand orientation of the protofibrils of amyloid beta-protein.
23131555|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is caused by abnormal deposition (fibrillation) of a 42-residue amyloid beta-protein (Abeta42) in the brain. During the process of fibrillation, the Abeta42 takes the form of protofibrils with strong neurotoxicity, and is thus believed to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AD. To elucidate the supramolecular structure of the Abeta42 protofibrils, the intermolecular proximity of the Ala-21 residues in the Abeta42 protofibrils was analyzed by (13)C-(13)C rotational resonance experiments in the solid state. Unlike the Abeta42 fibrils, an intermolecular (13)C-(13)C correlation was not found in the Abeta42 protofibrils. This result suggests that the beta-strands of the Abeta42 protofibrils are not in an in-register parallel orientation. Abeta42 monomers would assemble to form protofibrils with the beta-strand conformation, then transform into fibrils by forming intermolecular parallel beta-sheets.

23132858|t|Differential regulation of amyloid-beta endocytic trafficking and lysosomal degradation by apolipoprotein E isoforms.
23132858|a|Aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides leads to synaptic disruption and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer disease (AD). A major Abeta clearance pathway in the brain is cellular uptake and degradation. However, how Abeta traffics through the endocytic pathway and how AD risk factors regulate this event is unclear. Here we show that the majority of endocytosed Abeta in neurons traffics through early and late endosomes to the lysosomes for degradation. Overexpression of Rab5 or Rab7, small GTPases that function in vesicle fusion for early and late endosomes, respectively, significantly accelerates Abeta endocytic trafficking to the lysosomes. We also found that a portion of endocytosed Abeta traffics through Rab11-positive recycling vesicles. A blockage of this Abeta recycling pathway with a constitutively active Rab11 mutant significantly accelerates cellular Abeta accumulation. Inhibition of lysosomal enzymes results in Abeta accumulation and aggregation. Importantly, apolipoprotein E (apoE) accelerates neuronal Abeta uptake, lysosomal trafficking, and degradation in an isoform-dependent manner with apoE3 more efficiently facilitating Abeta trafficking and degradation than apoE4, a risk factor for AD. Taken together, our results demonstrate that Abeta endocytic trafficking to lysosomes for degradation is a major Abeta clearance pathway that is differentially regulated by apoE isoforms. A disturbance of this pathway can lead to accumulation and aggregation of cellular Abeta capable of causing neurotoxicity and seeding amyloid.

23134465|t|A shift in microglial beta-amyloid binding in Alzheimer's disease is associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
23134465|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) are two common pathologies associated with beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation and inflammation in the brain; neither is well understood. The objective of this study was to evaluate human post-mortem brains from AD subjects with purely parenchymal pathology, and those with concomitant CAA (and age-matched controls) for differential expression of microglia-associated Abeta ligands thought to mediate Abeta clearance and the association of these receptors with complement activation. Homogenates of brain parenchyma and enriched microvessel fractions from occipital cortex were probed for levels of C3b, membrane attack complex (MAC), CD11b and alpha-2-macroglobulin and immunoprecipitation was used to immunoprecipitate (IP) CD11b complexed with C3b and Abeta. Both C3b and MAC were significantly increased in CAA compared to AD-only and controls and IP showed significantly increased CD11b/C3b complexes with Abeta in AD/CAA subjects. Confocal microscopy was used to visualize these interactions. MAC was remarkably associated with CAA-affected blood vessels compared to AD-only and control vessels. These findings are consistent with an Abeta clearance mechanism via microglial CD11b that delivers Abeta and C3b to blood vessels in AD/CAA, which leads to Abeta deposition and propagation of complement to the cytolytic MAC, possibly leading to vascular fragility.

23137948|t|Brain imaging and fluid biomarker analysis in young adults at genetic risk for autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease in the presenilin 1 E280A kindred: a case-control study.
23137948|a|BACKGROUND: We have previously characterised functional brain abnormalities in young adults at genetic risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease. To gain further knowledge on the preclinical phase of Alzheimer's disease, we sought to characterise structural and functional MRI, CSF, and plasma biomarkers in a cohort of young adults carrying a high-penetrance autosomal dominant mutation that causes early-onset Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: Between January and August, 2010, 18-26-year-old presenilin 1 (PSEN1) E280A mutation carriers and non-carriers from the Colombian Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative Registry in Medellin Antioquia, Colombia, had structural MRI, functional MRI during associative memory encoding and novel viewing and control tasks, and cognitive assessments. Consenting participants also had lumbar punctures and venepunctures. Outcome measures were task-dependent hippocampal or parahippocampal activations and precuneus or posterior cingulate deactivations, regional grey matter reductions, CSF Abeta(1-42), total tau and phospho-tau(181) concentrations, and plasma Abeta(1-42) concentrations and Abeta(1-42):Abeta(1-40) ratios. Structural and functional MRI data were compared using automated brain mapping algorithms and search regions related to Alzheimer's disease. Cognitive and fluid biomarkers were compared using Mann-Whitney tests. FINDINGS: 44 participants were included: 20 PSEN1 E280A mutation carriers and 24 non-carriers. The carrier and non-carrier groups did not differ significantly in their dementia ratings, neuropsychological test scores, or proportion of apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 carriers. Compared with non-carriers, carriers had greater right hippocampal and parahippocampal activation (p=0 001 and p<0 014, respectively, after correction for multiple comparisons), less precuneus and posterior cingulate deactivation (all p<0 010 after correction), and less grey matter in several parietal regions (all p<0 002 uncorrected and corrected p=0 009 in the right parietal search region). In the 20 participants (ten PSEN1 E280A mutation carriers and ten non-carriers) who had lumbar punctures and venepunctures, mutation carriers had higher CSF Abeta(1-42) concentrations (p=0 008) and plasma Abeta(1-42) concentrations (p=0 01) than non-carriers. INTERPRETATION: Young adults at genetic risk for autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease have functional and structural MRI findings and CSF and plasma biomarker findings consistent with Abeta(1-42) overproduction. Although the extent to which the underlying brain changes are either neurodegenerative or developmental remain to be determined, this study shows the earliest known biomarker changes in cognitively normal people at genetic risk for autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease.

23137949|t|Florbetapir PET analysis of amyloid-beta deposition in the presenilin 1 E280A autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease kindred: a cross-sectional study.
23137949|a|BACKGROUND: Fibrillar amyloid-beta (Abeta) is thought to begin accumulating in the brain many years before the onset of clinical impairment in patients with Alzheimer's disease. By assessing the accumulation of Abeta in people at risk of genetic forms of Alzheimer's disease, we can identify how early preclinical changes start in individuals certain to develop dementia later in life. We sought to characterise the age-related accumulation of Abeta deposition in presenilin 1 (PSEN1) E280A mutation carriers across the spectrum of preclinical disease. METHODS: Between Aug 1 and Dec 6, 2011, members of the familial Alzheimer's disease Colombian kindred aged 18-60 years were recruited from the Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative's registry at the University of Antioquia, Medellin, Colombia. Cross-sectional assessment using florbetapir PET was done in symptomatic mutation carriers with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, asymptomatic carriers, and asymptomatic non-carriers. These assessments were done at the Banner Alzheimer's Institute in Phoenix, AZ, USA. A cortical grey matter mask consisting of six predefined regions.was used to measure mean cortical florbetapir PET binding. Cortical-to-pontine standard-uptake value ratios were used to characterise the cross-sectional accumulation of fibrillar Abeta deposition in carriers and non-carriers with regression analysis and to estimate the trajectories of fibrillar Abeta deposition. FINDINGS: We enrolled a cohort of 11 symptomatic individuals, 19 presymptomatic mutation carriers, and 20 asymptomatic non-carriers, ranging in age from 20 to 56 years. There was greater florbetapir binding in asymptomatic PSEN1 E280A mutation carriers than in age matched non-carriers. Fibrillar Abeta began to accumulate in PSEN 1E280A mutation carriers at a mean age of 28 2 years (95% CI 27 3-33 4), about 16 years and 21 years before the predicted median ages at mild cognitive impairment and dementia onset, respectively. (18)F florbetapir binding rose steeply over the next 9 4 years and plateaued at a mean age of 37 6 years (95% CI 35 3-40 2), about 6 and 11 years before the expected respective median ages at mild cognitive impairment and dementia onset. Prominent florbetapir binding was seen in the anterior and posterior cingulate, precuneus, and parietotemporal and frontal grey matter, as well as in the basal ganglia. Binding in the basal ganglia was not seen earlier or more prominently than in other regions. INTERPRETATION: These findings contribute to the understanding of preclinical familial Alzheimer's disease and help set the stage for assessment of amyloid-modifying treatments in the prevention of familial Alzheimer's disease.

23138650|t|Presenilin-1 adopts pathogenic conformation in normal aging and in sporadic Alzheimer's disease.
23138650|a|Accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, inflammation and synaptic and neuronal loss are some of the major neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). While genetic mutations in amyloid precursor protein and presenilin-1 and -2 (PS1 and PS2) genes cause early-onset familial AD, the etiology of sporadic AD is not fully understood. Our current study shows that changes in conformation of endogenous wild-type PS1, similar to those found with mutant PS1, occur in sporadic AD brain and during normal aging. Using a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (Tg2576) that overexpresses the Swedish mutation of amyloid precursor protein but has normal levels of endogenous wild-type presenilin, we report that the percentage of PS1 in a pathogenic conformation increases with age. Importantly, we found that this PS1 conformational shift is associated with amyloid pathology and precedes amyloid-beta deposition in the brain. Furthermore, we found that oxidative stress, a common stress characteristic of aging and AD, causes pathogenic PS1 conformational change in neurons in vitro, which is accompanied by increased Abeta42/40 ratio. The results of this study provide important information about the timeline of pathogenic changes in PS1 conformation during aging and suggest that structural changes in PS1/gamma-secretase may represent a molecular mechanism by which oxidative stress triggers amyloid-beta accumulation in aging and in sporadic AD brain.

23141384|t|Intersite variability of CSF Alzheimer's disease biomarkers in clinical setting.
23141384|a|BACKGROUND: The assessment of total tau, phosphorylated tau (pTau-181) and amyloid beta (Abeta 1-42) concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of subjects has been validated for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although these measurements have shown some variability, little is known about their intersite variability in clinical settings. METHODS: A total of 880 subjects (AD, n = 515; non-AD, n = 365) from three French memory centers were included. Receiver-operating characteristic analyses were performed to computerized area under curves (AUCs) and optimal thresholds for each biomarker in the three centers. A test-retest study was performed in a group of 32 CSF samples by repeated blind analysis of the three biomarkers using the same immunoassay batches in the three centers. RESULTS: In the three centers, tau (AUC, 0.82-0.88) and pTau-181 (AUC, 0.83-0.89) outperformed Abeta 1-42 (AUC, 0.70 -0.73) to discriminate subjects with AD from those without AD. An intersite variation of mean levels and cutoffs was observed for the three biomarkers. This variation was higher for Abeta 1-42 (range of cutoff, 368-582 pg/mL) than for tau (range of cutoff, 289-353 pg/mL). In a test-retest study, the mean interlaboratory coefficients of variation were 12.2% for Abeta 1-42, 11.3% for tau, and 11.5% for pTau-181. CONCLUSION: Intercenter variability of CSF biomarkers has been confirmed in a multisite cohort of subjects and can be improved in clinical settings. Efforts on harmonization of procedures should be encouraged to optimize the accuracy of CSF biomarkers in AD.

23143229|t|APP mutations in the Abeta coding region are associated with abundant cerebral deposition of Abeta38.
23143229|a|Abeta is the main component of amyloid deposits in Alzheimer disease (AD) and its aggregation into oligomers, protofibrils and fibrils is considered a seminal event in the pathogenesis of AD. Abeta with C-terminus at residue 42 is the most abundant species in parenchymal deposits, whereas Abeta with C-terminus at residue 40 predominates in the amyloid of the walls of large vessels. Abeta peptides with other C-termini have not yet been thoroughly investigated. We analysed Abeta38 in the brains of patients with Abeta deposition linked to sporadic and familial AD, hereditary cerebral haemorrhage with amyloidosis, or Down syndrome. Immunohistochemistry, confocal microscopy, immunoelectron microscopy, immunoprecipitation and the electrophoresis separation of low molecular weight aggregates revealed that Abeta38 accumulates consistently in the brains of patients carrying APP mutations in the Abeta coding region, but was not detected in the patients with APP mutations outside the Abeta domain, in the patients with presenilin mutations or in subjects with Down syndrome. In the patients with sporadic AD, Abeta38 was absent in the senile plaques, but it was detected only in the vessel walls of a small subset of patients with severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Our results suggest that APP mutations in the Abeta coding region favour Abeta38 accumulation in the brain and that the molecular mechanisms of Abeta deposition in these patients may be different from those active in patients with familial AD associated with other genetic defects and sporadic AD.

23143330|t|Nanoprobing of the effect of Cu(2+) cations on misfolding, interaction and aggregation of amyloid beta peptide.
23143330|a|Misfolding and aggregation of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Both processes are dependent on the environmental conditions, including the presence of divalent cations, such as Cu(2+). Cu(2+) cations regulate early stages of Abeta aggregation, but the molecular mechanism of Cu(2+) regulation is unknown. In this study we applied single molecule AFM force spectroscopy to elucidate the role of Cu(2+) cations on interpeptide interactions. By immobilizing one of two interacting Abeta42 molecules on a mica surface and tethering the counterpart molecule onto the tip, we were able to probe the interpeptide interactions in the presence and absence of Cu(2+) cations at pH 7.4, 6.8, 6.0, 5.0, and 4.0. The results show that the presence of Cu(2+) cations change the pattern of Abeta interactions for pH values between pH 7.4 and pH 5.0. Under these conditions, Cu(2+) cations induce Abeta42 peptide structural changes resulting in N-termini interactions within the dimers. Cu(2+) cations also stabilize the dimers. No effects of Cu(2+) cations on Abeta-Abeta interactions were observed at pH 4.0, suggesting that peptide protonation changes the peptide-cation interaction. The effect of Cu(2+) cations on later stages of Abeta aggregation was studied by AFM topographic images. The results demonstrate that substoichiometric Cu(2+) cations accelerate the formation of fibrils at pH 7.4 and 5.0, whereas no effect of Cu(2+) cations was observed at pH 4.0. Taken together, the combined AFM force spectroscopy and imaging analyses demonstrate that Cu(2+) cations promote both the initial and the elongation stages of Abeta aggregation, but protein protonation diminishes the effect of Cu(2+).

23145996|t|Rapid cytotoxicity screening platform for amyloid inhibitors using a membrane-potential sensitive fluorescent probe.
23145996|a|The growing interest in membrane interactions of amyloidogenic proteins indicates that lipid binding and the regulation of membrane potential are critical to the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's (PD), Alzheimer's (AD), and prion diseases. Advancing the understanding of this field requires the application of varied biophysical and biological techniques designed to probe the characteristics and underlying mechanisms of membrane-peptide interactions. Therefore, the development of a rapid cytotoxicity evaluation system using a membrane potential-sensitive bis-oxonol fluorescent dye, DiBAC4(3) is reported here. The exposure of C-terminal truncated alpha-synuclein 119 (alpha-Syn119) and amyloid-beta(1-42) (Abeta(1-42)) to U2-OS cell cultures resulted in an immediate, significant, and concentration-dependent increase in fluorescence response of DiBAC4(3). This response was strongly correlated with the cytotoxicity of alpha-Syn119 and Abeta(1-42) as determined by conventional CC8 and ATP assays. Furthermore, the capacity of well-defined polyphenolic antioxidants (i.e., pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), baicalein, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), and myricetin) to mitigate amyloid-induced cytotoxicity was evaluated using the developed biosensing system. We envisage that this work would accelerate the development of a rapid and cost-effective high-throughput screening platform in drug discovery for AD and PD.

23146634|t|Soluble oligomers and fibrillar species of amyloid beta-peptide differentially affect cognitive functions and hippocampal inflammatory response.
23146634|a|Two major active species of beta-amyloid protein (Abeta), fibrillar Abeta1-42 (FAbeta) and soluble Abeta1-42 oligomers (AbetaO), are known to play important roles in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. However, the differences between them are largely unknown. In this study, we explored the effects of FAbeta and AbetaO on cognitive functions and hippocampal inflammatory response through a 30-days infusion of FAbeta or AbetaO (144pmol/d) into the left lateral ventricles of the rat brain. Morris water maze showed that the impairment of learning and memory functions was much more significant in the AbetaO-infused rats, compared to the FAbeta-infused rats. AbetaO-induced neurodegeneration and ultrastructure damage in CA1 neurons were more remarkable than those induced by FAbeta. Compared to FAbeta, AbetaO exerted more potent effects on the expressions of inflammatory factors toll-like receptor 4 and TNF-alpha and activation of NF-kappaB signaling. Taken together, our results from in vivo model demonstrate that AbetaO is more neurotoxic than FAbeta, and this neurotoxicity may be related to NF-kappaB-medicated inflammatory response.

23147505|t|Digital pathology and image analysis for robust high-throughput quantitative assessment of Alzheimer disease neuropathologic changes.
23147505|a|Quantitative neuropathologic methods provide information that is important for both research and clinical applications. The technologic advancement of digital pathology and image analysis offers new solutions to enable valid quantification of pathologic severity that is reproducible between raters regardless of experience. Using an Aperio ScanScope XT and its accompanying image analysis software, we designed algorithms for quantitation of amyloid and tau pathologies on 65 beta-amyloid (6F/3D antibody) and 48 phospho-tau (PHF-1)-immunostained sections of human temporal neocortex. Quantitative digital pathologic data were compared with manual pathology counts. There were excellent correlations between manually counted and digitally analyzed neuropathologic parameters (R2 = 0.56-0.72). Data were highly reproducible among 3 participants with varying degrees of expertise in neuropathology (intraclass correlation coefficient values, >0.910). Digital quantification also provided additional parameters, including average plaque area, which shows statistically significant differences when samples are stratified according to apolipoprotein E allele status (average plaque area, 380.9 mum2 in apolipoprotein E [Latin Small Letter Open E]4 carriers vs 274.4 mum2 for noncarriers; p < 0.001). Thus, digital pathology offers a rigorous and reproducible method for quantifying Alzheimer disease neuropathologic changes and may provide additional insights into morphologic characteristics that were previously more challenging to assess because of technical limitations.

23149553|t|Early brain injury alters the blood-brain barrier phenotype in parallel with beta-amyloid and cognitive changes in adulthood.
23149553|a|Clinical studies suggest that traumatic brain injury (TBI) hastens cognitive decline and development of neuropathology resembling brain aging. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption following TBI may contribute to the aging process by deregulating substance exchange between the brain and blood. We evaluated the effect of juvenile TBI (jTBI) on these processes by examining long-term alterations of BBB proteins, beta-amyloid (Abeta) neuropathology, and cognitive changes. A controlled cortical impact was delivered to the parietal cortex of male rats at postnatal day 17, with behavioral studies and brain tissue evaluation at 60 days post-injury (dpi). Immunoglobulin G extravasation was unchanged, and jTBI animals had higher levels of tight-junction protein claudin 5 versus shams, suggesting the absence of BBB disruption. However, decreased P-glycoprotein (P-gp) on cortical blood vessels indicates modifications of BBB properties. In parallel, we observed higher levels of endogenous rodent Abeta in several brain regions of the jTBI group versus shams. In addition at 60 dpi, jTBI animals displayed systematic search strategies rather than relying on spatial memory during the water maze. Together, these alterations to the BBB phenotype after jTBI may contribute to the accumulation of toxic products, which in turn may induce cognitive differences and ultimately accelerate brain aging.

23150673|t|C1q-induced LRP1B and GPR6 proteins expressed early in Alzheimer disease mouse models, are essential for the C1q-mediated protection against amyloid-beta neurotoxicity.
23150673|a|Complement protein C1q is induced in the brain in response to a variety of neuronal injuries, including Alzheimer disease (AD), and blocks fibrillar amyloid-beta (fAbeta) neurotoxicity in vitro. Here, we show that C1q protects immature and mature primary neurons against fAbeta toxicity, and we report for the first time that C1q prevents toxicity induced by oligomeric forms of amyloid-beta (Abeta). Gene expression analysis reveals C1q-activated phosphorylated cAMP-response element-binding protein and AP-1, two transcription factors associated with neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth, and increased LRP1B and G protein-coupled receptor 6(GPR6) expression in fAbeta-injured neurons. Silencing of cAMP-response element-binding protein, LRP1B or GPR6 expression inhibited C1q-mediated neuroprotection from fAbeta-induced injury. In addition, C1q altered the association of oligomeric Abeta and fAbeta with neurons. In vivo, increased hippocampal expression of C1q, LRP1B, and GPR6 is observed as early as 2 months of age in the 3 x Tg mouse model of AD, whereas no such induction of LRP1B and GPR6 was seen in C1q-deficient AD mice. In contrast, expression of C1r and C1s, proteases required to activate the classical complement pathway, and C3 showed a significant age-dependent increase only after 10-13 months of age when Abeta plaques start to accumulate in this AD model. Thus, our results identify pathways by which C1q, up-regulated in vivo early in response to injury without the coordinate induction of other complement components, can induce a program of gene expression that promotes neuroprotection and thus may provide protection against Abeta in preclinical stages of AD and other neurodegenerative processes.

23150934|t|TREM2 variants in Alzheimer's disease.
23150934|a|BACKGROUND: Homozygous loss-of-function mutations in TREM2, encoding the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 protein, have previously been associated with an autosomal recessive form of early-onset dementia. METHODS: We used genome, exome, and Sanger sequencing to analyze the genetic variability in TREM2 in a series of 1092 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 1107 controls (the discovery set). We then performed a meta-analysis on imputed data for the TREM2 variant rs75932628 (predicted to cause a R47H substitution) from three genomewide association studies of Alzheimer's disease and tested for the association of the variant with disease. We genotyped the R47H variant in an additional 1887 cases and 4061 controls. We then assayed the expression of TREM2 across different regions of the human brain and identified genes that are differentially expressed in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and in control mice. RESULTS: We found significantly more variants in exon 2 of TREM2 in patients with Alzheimer's disease than in controls in the discovery set (P=0.02). There were 22 variant alleles in 1092 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 5 variant alleles in 1107 controls (P<0.001). The most commonly associated variant, rs75932628 (encoding R47H), showed highly significant association with Alzheimer's disease (P<0.001). Meta-analysis of rs75932628 genotypes imputed from genomewide association studies confirmed this association (P=0.002), as did direct genotyping of an additional series of 1887 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 4061 controls (P<0.001). Trem2 expression differed between control mice and a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. CONCLUSIONS: Heterozygous rare variants in TREM2 are associated with a significant increase in the risk of Alzheimer's disease. (Funded by Alzheimer's Research UK and others.).

23150940|t|Copper coordination to native N-terminally modified versus full-length amyloid-beta: second-sphere effects determine the species present at physiological pH.
23150940|a|Alzheimer's disease is characterized by senile plaques in which metallic ions (copper, zinc, and iron) are colocalized with amyloid-beta peptides of different sequences in aggregated forms. In addition to the full-length peptides (Abeta1-40/42), N-terminally truncated Abeta3-40/42 forms and their pyroglutamate counterparts, Abetap3-40/42, have been proposed to play key features in the aggregation process, leading to the senile plaques. Furthermore, they have been shown to be more toxic than the full-length Abeta, which made them central targets for therapeutic approaches. In order to better disentangle the possible role of metallic ions in the aggregation process, copper(II) coordination to the full-length amyloid peptides has been extensively studied in the last years. However, regarding the N-terminally modified forms at position 3, very little is known. Therefore, copper(I) and copper(II) coordination to those peptides have been investigated in the present report using a variety of complementary techniques and as a function of  pH. Copper(I) coordination is not affected by the N-terminal modifications. In contrast, copper(II) coordination is different from that previously reported for the full-length peptide. In the case of the pyroglutamate form, this is due to preclusion of N-terminal amine binding. In the case of the N-terminally truncated form, alteration in copper(II) coordination is caused by second-sphere effects that impact the first binding shell and the pH-dependent repartition of the various [Cu(peptide)] complexes. Such second-sphere effects are anticipated to apply to a variety of metal ions and peptides, and their importance on changing the first binding shell has not been fully recognized yet.

23151792|t|Effects of diet-induced hypercholesterolemia on amyloid accumulation in ovariectomized mice.
23151792|a|A central hypothesis in the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the accumulation and aggregation of  beta-amyloid peptide (A beta). Recent epidemiological studies suggest that patients with elevated cholesterol and decreased estrogen levels are more susceptible to AD through A beta accumulation. To test the above hypothesis, we used ovariectomized with diet-induced hypercholesterolemia (OVX) and hypercholesterolemia (HCL) diet alone mouse models. HPLC analysis reveals the presence of beta amyloid in the OVX and HCL mice brain. Congo red staining analysis revealed the extent of amyloid deposition in OVX and hypercholesterolemia mice brain. Overall, A beta levels were higher in OVX mice than in HCL. Secondly, estrogen receptors alpha (ER alpha) were assessed by immunohistochemistry and this suggested that there was a decreased expression of ER alpha in OVX animals when compared to hypercholesterolemic animals. A beta was quantified by Western blot and ELISA analysis. Overall, A beta levels were higher in OVX mice than in HCL mice. Our experimental results suggested that OVX animals were more susceptible to AD with significant increase in A beta peptide.

23152503|t|Interplay between alpha-, beta-, and gamma-secretases determines biphasic amyloid-beta protein level in the presence of a gamma-secretase inhibitor.
23152503|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) is produced by the consecutive cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) first by beta-secretase, generating C99, and then by gamma-secretase. APP is also cleaved by alpha-secretase. It is hypothesized that reducing the production of Abeta in the brain may slow the progression of Alzheimer disease. Therefore, different gamma-secretase inhibitors have been developed to reduce Abeta production. Paradoxically, it has been shown that low to moderate inhibitor concentrations cause a rise in Abeta production in different cell lines, in different animal models, and also in humans. A mechanistic understanding of the Abeta rise remains elusive. Here, a minimal mathematical model has been developed that quantitatively describes the Abeta dynamics in cell lines that exhibit the rise as well as in cell lines that do not. The model includes steps of APP processing through both the so-called amyloidogenic pathway and the so-called non-amyloidogenic pathway. It is shown that the cross-talk between these two pathways accounts for the increase in Abeta production in response to inhibitor, i.e. an increase in C99 will inhibit the non-amyloidogenic pathway, redirecting APP to be cleaved by beta-secretase, leading to an additional increase in C99 that overcomes the loss in gamma-secretase activity. With a minor extension, the model also describes plasma Abeta profiles observed in humans upon dosing with a gamma-secretase inhibitor. In conclusion, this mechanistic model rationalizes a series of experimental results that spans from in vitro to in vivo and to humans. This has important implications for the development of drugs targeting Abeta production in Alzheimer disease.

23152602|t|beta-secretase cleavage of the fly amyloid precursor protein is required for glial survival.
23152602|a|beta-secretase (or BACE1) is the key enzyme in the production of beta-amyloid (Abeta), which accumulates in the senile plaques characteristic for Alzheimer's disease. Consequently, the lack of BACE1 prevents beta-processing of the amyloid precursor protein and Abeta production, which made it a promising target for drug development. However, the loss of BACE1 is also detrimental, leading to myelination defects and altered neuronal activity, functions that have been associated with the cleavage of Neuregulin and a voltage-gated sodium channel subunit. Here we show that the Drosophila ortholog of BACE, dBACE, is required for glial survival. Cell-specific knockdown experiments reveal that this is a non-cell autonomous function, as a knockdown of dBACE in photoreceptor neurons leads to progressive degeneration of glia in their target zone, the lamina. Interestingly, this phenotype is suppressed by the loss of the fly amyloid precursor protein (APPL), whereas a secretion-deficient form of APPL enhances the degeneration. This shows that full-length APPL in neurons promotes the death of neighboring glial cells and that beta-processing of APPL is needed to prevent glial death. These results therefore not only demonstrate a novel function for an APP protein in glia, but they also show this function specifically requires regulation by beta-cleavage.

23152607|t|Cognitive profile of amyloid burden and white matter hyperintensities in cognitively normal older adults.
23152607|a|Amyloid burden and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) are two common markers of neurodegeneration present in advanced aging. Each represents a potential early indicator of an age-related neurological disorder that impacts cognition. The presence of amyloid is observed in a substantial subset of cognitively normal older adults, but the literature remains equivocal regarding whether amyloid in nondemented populations is deleterious to cognition. Similarly, WMH are detected in many nondemented older adults and there is a body of evidence indicating that WMH are associated with decreased executive function and other cognitive domains. The current study investigated amyloid burden and WMH in clinically normal older adult humans aged 65-86 (N = 168) and examined each biomarker's relation with cognitive domains of episodic memory, executive function, and speed of processing. Factors for each domain were derived from a neuropsychological battery on a theoretical basis without reference to the relation between cognition and the biomarkers. Amyloid burden and WMH were not correlated with one another. Age was associated with lower performance in all cognitive domains, while higher estimated verbal intelligence was associated with higher performance in all domains. Hypothesis-driven tests revealed that amyloid burden and WMH had distinct cognitive profiles, with amyloid burden having a specific influence on episodic memory and WMH primarily associated with executive function but having broad (but lesser) effects on the other domains. These findings suggest that even before clinical impairment, amyloid burden and WMH likely represent neuropathological cascades with distinct etiologies and dissociable influences on cognition.

23152610|t|Region-specific hierarchy between atrophy, hypometabolism, and beta-amyloid (Abeta) load in Alzheimer's disease dementia.
23152610|a|Gray matter atrophy, glucose hypometabolism, and beta-amyloid Abeta deposition are well-described hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, but their relationships are poorly understood. The present study aims to compare the local levels of these three alterations in humans with Alzheimer's disease. Structural magnetic resonance imaging, (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET), and (18)F-florbetapir PET data from 34 amyloid-negative healthy controls and 20 demented patients with a high probability of Alzheimer's disease etiology (attested using neuroimaging biomarkers as recently recommended) were analyzed. For each patient and imaging modality, age-adjusted Z-score maps were computed, and direct between-modality voxelwise comparison and correlation analyses were performed. Significant differences in the levels of atrophy, hypometabolism, and Abeta deposition were found in most brain areas, but the hierarchy differed across regions. A cluster analysis revealed distinct subsets of regions: (1) in the hippocampus, atrophy exceeded hypometabolism, whereas Abeta load was minimal; (2) in posterior association areas, Abeta deposition was predominant, together with high hypometabolism and lower but still significant atrophy; and (3) in frontal regions, Abeta deposition was maximal, whereas structural and metabolic alterations were low. Atrophy and hypometabolism significantly correlated in the hippocampus and temporo-parietal cortex, whereas Abeta load was not significantly related to either atrophy or hypometabolism. These findings provide direct evidence for regional variations in the hierarchy and relationships between Abeta load, hypometabolism, and atrophy. Altogether, these variations probably reflect the differential involvement of region-specific pathological or protective mechanisms, such as the presence of neurofibrillary tangles, disconnection, as well as compensation processes.

23152628|t|LRP1 in brain vascular smooth muscle cells mediates local clearance of Alzheimer's amyloid-beta.
23152628|a|Impaired clearance of amyloid-beta (Abeta) is a major pathogenic event for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta depositions in brain parenchyma as senile plaques and along cerebrovasculature as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) are hallmarks of AD. A major pathway that mediates brain Abeta clearance is the cerebrovascular system where Abeta is eliminated through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and/or degraded by cerebrovascular cells along the interstitial fluid drainage pathway. An Abeta clearance receptor, the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), is abundantly expressed in cerebrovasculature, in particular in vascular smooth muscle cells. Previous studies have indicated a role of LRP1 in endothelial cells in transcytosing Abeta out of the brain across the BBB; however, whether this represents a significant pathway for brain Abeta clearance remains controversial. Here, we demonstrate that Abeta can be cleared locally in the cerebrovasculature by an LRP1-dependent endocytic pathway in smooth muscle cells. The uptake and degradation of both endogenous and exogenous Abeta were significantly reduced in LRP1-suppressed human brain vascular smooth muscle cells. Conditional deletion of Lrp1 in vascular smooth muscle cell in amyloid model APP/PS1 mice accelerated brain Abeta accumulation and exacerbated Abeta deposition as amyloid plaques and CAA without affecting Abeta production. Our results demonstrate that LRP1 is a major Abeta clearance receptor in cerebral vascular smooth muscle cell and a disturbance of this pathway contributes to Abeta accumulation. These studies establish critical functions of the cerebrovasculature system in Abeta metabolism and identify a new pathway involved in the pathogenesis of both AD and CAA.

23155049|t|Inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 ameliorates beta-amyloid pathology and restores lysosomal acidification and mammalian target of rapamycin activity in the Alzheimer disease mouse model: in vivo and in vitro studies.
23155049|a|Accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposits is a primary pathological feature of Alzheimer disease that is correlated with neurotoxicity and cognitive decline. The role of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) in Alzheimer disease pathogenesis has been debated. To study the role of GSK-3 in Abeta pathology, we used 5XFAD mice co-expressing mutated amyloid precursor protein and presenilin-1 that develop massive cerebral Abeta loads. Both GSK-3 isozymes (alpha/beta) were hyperactive in this model. Nasal treatment of 5XFAD mice with a novel substrate competitive GSK-3 inhibitor, L803-mts, reduced Abeta deposits and ameliorated cognitive deficits. Analyses of 5XFAD hemi-brain samples indicated that L803-mts restored the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and inhibited autophagy. Lysosomal acidification was impaired in the 5XFAD brains as indicated by reduced cathepsin D activity and decreased N-glycoyslation of the vacuolar ATPase subunit V0a1, a modification required for lysosomal acidification. Treatment with L803-mts restored lysosomal acidification in 5XFAD brains. Studies in SH-SY5Y cells confirmed that GSK-3alpha and GSK-3beta impair lysosomal acidification and that treatment with L803-mts enhanced the acidic lysosomal pool as demonstrated in LysoTracker Red-stained cells. Furthermore, L803-mts restored impaired lysosomal acidification caused by dysfunctional presenilin-1. We provide evidence that mTOR is a target activated by GSK-3 but inhibited by impaired lysosomal acidification and elevation in amyloid precursor protein/Abeta loads. Taken together, our data indicate that GSK-3 is a player in Abeta pathology. Inhibition of GSK-3 restores lysosomal acidification that in turn enables clearance of Abeta burdens and reactivation of mTOR. These changes facilitate amelioration in cognitive function.

23157384|t|Different fates of Alzheimer's disease amyloid-beta fibrils remodeled by biocompatible small molecules.
23157384|a|Amyloid fibrils implicated in numerous human diseases are thermodynamically very stable. Stringent conditions that would not be possible in a physiological environment are often required to disrupt the stable fibrils. Recently, there is increasing evidence that small molecules can remodel amyloid fibrils in a physiologically relevant manner. In order to investigate possible fibril remodeling mechanisms using this approach, we performed comparative studies on the structural features of the different amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregates remodeled from Abeta fibrils by three biocompatible small molecules: methylene blue; brilliant blue G; and erythrosine B. Combined with circular dichroism (CD), immuno-blotting, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) results, it was found that brilliant blue G- and erythrosine B-treatment generate fragmented Abeta fibrils and protofibrils, respectively. In contrast, incubation of the Abeta fibrils with methylene blue perturbs fibrillar structure, leading to amorphous Abeta aggregates. Our findings provide insights on the molecular mechanism of amyloid fibril formation and remodeling and also illustrate the possibility of controlled changes in biomolecule nanostructures.

23159043|t|Abeta amyloid, cognition, and APOE genotype in healthy older adults.
23159043|a|BACKGROUND: Only one study has investigated the relationship between cerebral beta-amyloid (Abeta), apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 genotype, and cognition. Although significant relationships between cerebral Abeta and cognition were observed in epsilon4 carriers but not noncarriers, the magnitude of this relationship was not reported. Further, when demographic variables were controlled, the influence of APOE epsilon4 on the relationship between cerebral Abeta and cognition dissipated. METHODS: In 144 healthy older adults who had undergone amyloid scanning and APOE epsilon4 genotyping in the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers, and Lifestyle (AIBL) Flagship Study of Ageing, correlations were conducted to determine the magnitude of relationship between cerebral Abeta and cognition in epsilon4 carriers and noncarriers. Fisher's Z was used to compare these correlations and Cohen's q determined the magnitude of difference between correlations. RESULTS: Cerebral Abeta was significantly associated with tasks of visual and verbal episodic memory in APOE epsilon4 carriers. This association was not observed in epsilon4 noncarriers. The relationship between cerebral Abeta and episodic memory in epsilon4 carriers was significantly different from that in epsilon4 noncarriers, and the magnitude of this difference was small to moderate. CONCLUSIONS: In APOE epsilon 4 carriers, there is a moderate negative relationship between cerebral Abeta and episodic memory. This suggests that increased cerebral Abeta may signify the onset of preclinical AD, especially in healthy older adults who are genetically at risk for AD.

23159047|t|Biomarker evidence for uncoupling of amyloid build-up and toxicity in Alzheimer's disease.
23159047|a|Certain preparations of Alzheimer-associated amyloid beta (Abeta) exhibit rapid (within minutes) synaptotoxicity when applied to hippocampal slices or neuronal cell cultures, or when injected into the central nervous system of rodents. In addition, it is well known that some elderly people have brain amyloidosis without showing signs of cognitive impairment or neurodegeneration beyond the age norm. Biomarkers, reviewed extensively in a recent Perspectives article in Alzheimer's & Dementia, suggest that amyloid-positive individuals are at higher risk of Alzheimer's disease than similarly aged individuals without evidence of brain amyloidosis, provided they live long enough. But how can the brain resist amyloid pathology for many years? Here, we expand on recent biomarker studies suggesting that Abeta build-up and toxicity may occur in two phases. We hypothesize that the first phase may involve an autocatalytic build-up of a nontoxic Abeta reservoir, tentatively named the Abeta(Cat) pool, and that gain of toxicity may require brain incubation of Abeta in the water-deprived plaque milieu over years to produce modified forms of the protein that are truly neurotoxic (Abeta(Tox)). We argue for the need to describe the molecular natures of Abeta(Cat) and Abeta(Tox) in greater detail as a means to gain success in anti-Abeta disease-modifying drug development.

23160422|t|Where, when, and in what form does sporadic Alzheimer's disease begin?
23160422|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Intraneuronal lesions consisting of abnormal tau protein are seen to develop from the beginning until the end-phase of the pathological process underlying Alzheimer's disease. This review highlights the earliest phase of this process. RECENT FINDINGS: Development of abnormal tau frequently begins during childhood or puberty in nuclei of the lower brainstem sending diffuse projections to the cerebral cortex. Nonfibrillar abnormal tau material first occurs in the proximal axon of projection neurons in the locus coeruleus. Subsequently, a similar material (pretangle material) fills the somatodendritic compartment. In contrast with the pretangle material in cell bodies and dendrites, the nonfibrillar material in the axon normally does not convert into stable fibrillary inclusions. SUMMARY: Projection neurons (not only those of the locus coeruleus) are sturdy and can survive for a lifetime despite the existence of Alzheimer-related abnormal tau. Currently, little understood mechanisms most probably exist that enable neurons to fulfill their general functions even when severe tau pathology is present. The proclivity of predisposed neuronal types to develop abnormal tau may be intrinsic to the human brain. However, the tempo of disease progression reveals considerable individual differences, thereby offering opportunities to study conditions that may modify disease progression.

23161113|t|Distinct cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta peptide signatures in cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia.
23161113|a|Mild alterations in cognitive function are present in normal aging and severe cognitive alterations are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cognitive deficits are prevalent in patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) and worsen with old age. We recently reported that elderly SCZ patients show reduced levels of amyloid-beta (Abeta)1-42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). To further clarify the role of Abeta in cognitive decline, we analyzed the whole panel of CSF Abeta isoforms in elderly SCZ patients as well as in sporadic AD using SELDI TOF MS. The immunoproteomic study revealed, in all analyzed CSF samples, the presence of 15 different Abeta peptides. In CSF from SCZ, we detected an overall strong reduction of almost all Abeta species while in sporadic AD Abeta1-42 was the only peptide reduced. A significant independent association between Abeta1-40 levels and global cognition was found in SCZ. In addition, in SCZ patients, duration of therapy was positively associated with soluble amyloid precursor protein alpha levels, the total amount of CSF Abeta and the most abundant Abeta1-40 isoform. These data suggests a dysmetabolism of amyloid precursor protein in older SCZ patients. Thus, the quite comparable reduction of CSF Abeta1-42 in AD and in elderly SCZ patients reflects different pathophysiological dynamics in ageing brain.

23161913|t|Rational design of potent domain antibody inhibitors of amyloid fibril assembly.
23161913|a|Antibodies hold significant potential for inhibiting toxic protein aggregation associated with conformational disorders such as Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases. However, near-stoichiometric antibody concentrations are typically required to completely inhibit protein aggregation. We posited that the molecular interactions mediating amyloid fibril formation could be harnessed to generate antibodies with potent antiaggregation. Here we report that grafting small amyloidogenic peptides (6-10 residues) into the complementarity-determining regions of a single-domain (V(H)) antibody yields potent domain antibody inhibitors of amyloid formation. Grafted AMyloid-Motif AntiBODIES (gammabodies) presenting hydrophobic peptides from Abeta (Alzheimer's disease), alpha-Synuclein (Parkinson's disease), and islet amyloid polypeptide (type 2 diabetes) inhibit fibril assembly of each corresponding polypeptide at low substoichiometric concentrations (1:10 gammabody:monomer molar ratio). In contrast, sequence- and conformation-specific antibodies that were obtained via immunization are unable to prevent fibrillization at the same substoichiometric concentrations. Gammabodies prevent amyloid formation by converting monomers and/or fibrillar intermediates into small complexes that are unstructured and benign. We expect that our antibody design approach--which eliminates the need for immunization or screening to identify sequence-specific domain antibody inhibitors--can be readily extended to generate potent aggregation inhibitors of other amyloidogenic polypeptides linked to human disease.

23161999|t|Pathological alpha-synuclein transmission initiates Parkinson-like neurodegeneration in nontransgenic mice.
23161999|a|Parkinson's disease is characterized by abundant alpha-synuclein (alpha-Syn) neuronal inclusions, known as Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, and the massive loss of midbrain dopamine neurons. However, a cause-and-effect relationship between Lewy inclusion formation and neurodegeneration remains unclear. Here, we found that in wild-type nontransgenic mice, a single intrastriatal inoculation of synthetic alpha-Syn fibrils led to the cell-to-cell transmission of pathologic alpha-Syn and Parkinson's-like Lewy pathology in anatomically interconnected regions. Lewy pathology accumulation resulted in progressive loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, but not in the adjacent ventral tegmental area, and was accompanied by reduced dopamine levels culminating in motor deficits. This recapitulation of a neurodegenerative cascade thus establishes a mechanistic link between transmission of pathologic alpha-Syn and the cardinal features of Parkinson's disease.

23163430|t|Effective targeting of Abeta to macrophages by sonochemically prepared surface-modified protein microspheres.
23163430|a|Imbalanced homeostasis and oligomerization of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide in the brain are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Microglia and macrophages play a critical role in the etiology of AD either by clearing Abeta from the brain or inducing inflammation. Recent evidence suggests that clearance of Abeta by microglia/macrophages via the phagocytic pathway is defective in AD, which can contribute to the accumulation of Abeta in the brain. We have recently demonstrated that protein microspheres modified at their surface with multiple copies of an Abeta-recognition motif can strongly bind Abeta, inhibit its aggregation, and directly reduce its toxicity by sequestering it from the medium. Here, we describe how microsphere-bound Abeta can stimulate microglial cells and be phagocytosed through a mechanism that is distinct from that of Abeta removal and, thus, contribute to the clearance of Abeta, even by defective microglial cells. The phagocytosis was most effective, with microspheres having a diameter of <1 mum. The introduction of polyethylene glycol to the surface of the microspheres changed the kinetics of the phagocytosis. Moreover, while aggregated Abeta induced a significant inflammatory response that was manifested by the release of TNF-alpha, the microsphere-bound Abeta dramatically reduced the amount of cytokine released from microglial cells.

23164548|t|Improving Alzheimer's disease phase II clinical trials.
23164548|a|Over the past 30 years, many drugs have been studied as possible treatments for Alzheimer's disease, but only four have demonstrated sufficient efficacy to be approved as treatments, of which three are in the same class. This lack of success has raised questions both in the pharmaceutical industry and academia about the future of Alzheimer's disease therapy. The high cost and low success rate of drug development across many disease areas can be attributed, in large part, to late-stage clinical failures (Schachter and Ramoni, Nat Rev Drug Discov 2007;6:107-8). Thus, identifying in phase II, or preferably phase I, drugs that are likely to fail would have a dramatic impact on the costs associated with developing new drugs. With this in mind, the Alzheimer's Association convened a Research Roundtable on June 23 and 24, 2011, in Washington, DC, bringing together scientists from academia, industry, and government regulatory agencies to discuss strategies for improving the probability of phase II trial results predicting success when considering the go/no-go decision-making process leading to the initiation of phase III.

23164550|t|Amyloid imaging and cognitive decline in nondemented oldest-old: the 90+ Study.
23164550|a|BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to examine cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between cognitive performance and beta amyloid (Abeta) load determined by florbetapir F18 positron emission tomography (PET) in nondemented oldest-old. METHODS: Thirteen nondemented (normal or cognitively impaired nondemented) participants (median age, 94.2 years) from The 90+ Study underwent florbetapir-PET scanning within 3 months of baseline neuropsychological testing. Amyloid load was measured with a semi-automated quantitative analysis of average cortical-to-cerebellar standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr) and a visual interpretation (Abeta- or Abeta+). Neuropsychological testing was repeated every 6 months. RESULTS: At baseline, SUVr correlated significantly with tests of global cognition and memory. During follow-up (median, 1.5 years), the Abeta+ group had steeper declines on most cognitive tests, particularly global cognitive measures. CONCLUSION: This preliminary study suggests that greater amyloid load is associated with poorer cognition and faster cognitive decline in nondemented oldest-old. Amyloid load may identify individuals at increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.

23164552|t|Impact of molecular imaging on the diagnostic process in a memory clinic.
23164552|a|BACKGROUND: [(11)C]Pittsburgh compound B ([(11)C]PIB) and [(18)F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([(18)F]FDG) PET measure fibrillar amyloid-beta load and glucose metabolism, respectively. We evaluated the impact of these tracers on the diagnostic process in a memory clinic population. METHODS: One hundred fifty-four patients underwent paired dynamic [(11)C]PIB and static [(18)F]FDG PET scans shortly after completing a standard dementia screening. Two-year clinical follow-up data were available for 39 patients. Parametric PET images were assessed visually and results were reported to the neurologists responsible for the initial diagnosis. Outcome measures were (change in) clinical diagnosis and confidence in that diagnosis before and after disclosing PET results. RESULTS: [(11)C]PIB scans were positive in 40 of 66 (61%) patients with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), 5 of 18 (28%) patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), 4 of 5 (80%) patients with Lewy body dementia, and 3 of 10 (30%) patients with other dementias. [(18)F]FDG uptake patterns matched the clinical diagnosis in 38 of 66 (58%) of AD patients, and in 6 of 18 (33%) FTD patients. PET results led to a change in diagnosis in 35 (23%) patients. This only occurred when prior diagnostic certainty was <90%. Diagnostic confidence increased from 71 +- 17% before to 87 +- 16% after PET (p < .001). Two-year clinical follow-up (n = 39) showed that [(11)C]PIB and [(18)F]FDG predicted progression to AD for patients with mild cognitive impairment, and that the diagnosis of dementia established after PET remained unchanged in 96% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: In a memory clinic setting, combined [(11)C]PIB and [(18)F]FDG PET are of additional value on top of the standard diagnostic work-up, especially when prior diagnostic confidence is low.

23164821|t|Clusterin regulates beta-amyloid toxicity via Dickkopf-1-driven induction of the wnt-PCP-JNK pathway.
23164821|a|Although the mechanism of Abeta action in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has remained elusive, it is known to increase the expression of the antagonist of canonical wnt signalling, Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1), whereas the silencing of Dkk1 blocks Abeta neurotoxicity. We asked if clusterin, known to be regulated by wnt, is part of an Abeta/Dkk1 neurotoxic pathway. Knockdown of clusterin in primary neurons reduced Abeta toxicity and DKK1 upregulation and, conversely, Abeta increased intracellular clusterin and decreased clusterin protein secretion, resulting in the p53-dependent induction of DKK1. To further elucidate how the clusterin-dependent induction of Dkk1 by Abeta mediates neurotoxicity, we measured the effects of Abeta and Dkk1 protein on whole-genome expression in primary neurons, finding a common pathway suggestive of activation of wnt-planar cell polarity (PCP)-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signalling leading to the induction of genes including EGR1 (early growth response-1), NAB2 (Ngfi-A-binding protein-2) and KLF10 (Kruppel-like factor-10) that, when individually silenced, protected against Abeta neurotoxicity and/or tau phosphorylation. Neuronal overexpression of Dkk1 in transgenic mice mimicked this Abeta-induced pathway and resulted in age-dependent increases in tau phosphorylation in hippocampus and cognitive impairment. Furthermore, we show that this Dkk1/wnt-PCP-JNK pathway is active in an Abeta-based mouse model of AD and in AD brain, but not in a tau-based mouse model or in frontotemporal dementia brain. Thus, we have identified a pathway whereby Abeta induces a clusterin/p53/Dkk1/wnt-PCP-JNK pathway, which drives the upregulation of several genes that mediate the development of AD-like neuropathologies, thereby providing new mechanistic insights into the action of Abeta in neurodegenerative diseases.

23166389|t|Amyloid-beta imaging with Pittsburgh compound B and florbetapir: comparing radiotracers and quantification methods.
23166389|a|UNLABELLED: (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B ((11)C-PiB) and (18)F-florbetapir amyloid-beta (Abeta) PET radioligands have had a substantial impact on Alzheimer disease research. Although there is evidence that both radioligands bind to fibrillar Abeta in the brain, direct comparisons in the same individuals have not been reported. Here, we evaluated PiB and florbetapir in a retrospective convenience sample of cognitively normal older controls, patients with mild cognitive impairment, and patients with Alzheimer disease from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). METHODS: From the ADNI database, 32 participants were identified who had undergone at least 1 PiB study and subsequently underwent a florbetapir study approximately 1.5 y after the last PiB study. Cortical PiB and florbetapir retention was quantified using several different methods to determine the effect of preprocessing factors (such as smoothing and reference region selection) and image processing pipelines. RESULTS: There was a strong association between PiB and florbetapir cortical retention ratios (Spearman rho = 0.86-0.95), and these were slightly lower than cortical retention ratios for consecutive PiB scans (Spearman rho = 0.96-0.98) made approximately 1.1 y apart. Cortical retention ratios for Abeta-positive subjects tended to be higher for PiB than for florbetapir images, yielding slopes for linear regression of florbetapir against PiB of 0.59-0.64. Associations between consecutive PiB scans and between PiB and florbetapir scans remained strong, regardless of processing methods such as smoothing, spatial normalization to a PET template, and use of reference regions. The PiB-florbetapir association was used to interconvert cutoffs for Abeta positivity and negativity between the 2 radioligands, and these cutoffs were highly consistent in their assignment of Abeta status. CONCLUSION: PiB and florbetapir retention ratios were strongly associated in the same individuals, and this relationship was consistent across several data analysis methods, despite scan-rescan intervals of more than a year. Cutoff thresholds for determining positive or negative Abeta status can be reliably transformed from PiB to florbetapir units or vice versa using a population scanned with both radioligands.

23168324|t|Deleterious effects of soluble beta amyloid on cognition, antagonism by saline and noradrenaline, a role for microglia.
23168324|a|Small oligomeric beta amyloid (Abeta(1-42)) injected 45 min prior to single-trial bead discrimination training resulted in impaired learning in day-old chickens. A new experimental protocol was used where the injections of drugs were at times around the time of injection of Abeta. It was found that the Na(+) levels of the saline used to dissolve Abeta affected cognitive impairment. Na(+) levels above the normal plasma value (140 mM) reduced Abeta-induced learning deficits whereas levels below increased sensitivity to Abeta. The new protocol was also used to examine the ability of certain noradrenergic adrenoceptor antagonist and agonists, insulin, glucose and minocycline to reduce learning disruption caused by Abeta. The drugs (made up in 154 mM sodium chloride) were injected before, at the same time or after the injection of Abeta and although all drugs prevented Abeta-induced disruption of learning when given in the same injection as Abeta, some injected before could prevent Abeta disrupting learning, whereas others could rescue learning ability when given after Abeta injection. These results are interpreted in the light of possible actions of noradrenaline on microglia and various processes: astrocytic metabolism, cerebral microcirculation, and removal of Abeta away from the site of injection. The possible importance of hypernatremia and hyponatremia in the incidence of Alzheimer's disease is discussed.

23170058|t|Induction of amyloid-beta(1-42) in the retina and optic nerve head of chronic ocular hypertensive monkeys.
23170058|a|PURPOSE: Recent studies have indicated that accumulation of amyloid beta(1-42) (Abeta(1-42)), which is associated with the progression of Alzheimer disease, may also be responsible for retinal ganglion cell death in glaucoma. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression and localization of Abeta(1-42) in the retina and the optic nerve head (ONH) of monkeys with experimental glaucoma. METHODS: Five cynomolgus monkeys with a glaucomatous left eye at 4, 9, 11, 15, and 24 weeks after laser photocoagulation treatment were studied by immunohistochemical methods. Another two cynomolgus monkeys with a glaucomatous left eye at 133 weeks after laser photocoagulation treatment were used to measure Abeta(1-42) concentrations in the retina by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: At 11 to 24 weeks after the laser photocoagulation treatment, Abeta(1-42) was upregulated in the nerve fiber layer (NFL) and the ganglion cell layer (GCL) of the retina and the ONH, but the expression of amyloid precursor protein decreased in the NFL and ONH from levels at 9 weeks. The localizations of Abeta(1-42) were merged in glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astroglial cells but not phosphorylated neurofilament heavy- or nonphosphorylated neurofilament heavy-positive axons in the retina and the ONH. Likewise, Abeta(1-42) concentrations in the retina of monkeys increased in the chronic stage of glaucoma. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the upregulation of Abeta(1-42) after an intraocular pressure elevation could apply to monkeys since the structure of the ONH is more similar to humans than that of rodents.

23175831|t|No consistent bioenergetic defects in presynaptic nerve terminals isolated from mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.
23175831|a|Depressed cortical energy supply and impaired synaptic function are predominant associations of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To test the hypothesis that presynaptic bioenergetic deficits are associated with the progression of AD pathogenesis, we compared bioenergetic variables of cortical and hippocampal presynaptic nerve terminals (synaptosomes) from commonly used mouse models with AD-like phenotypes (J20 age 6 months, Tg2576 age 16 months, and APP/PS age 9 and 14 months) to age-matched controls. No consistent bioenergetic deficiencies were detected in synaptosomes from the three models; only APP/PS cortical synaptosomes from 14-month-old mice showed an increase in respiration associated with proton leak. J20 mice were chosen for a highly stringent investigation of mitochondrial function and content. There were no significant differences in the quality of the synaptosomal preparations or the mitochondrial volume fraction. Furthermore, respiratory variables, calcium handling, and membrane potentials of synaptosomes from symptomatic J20 mice under calcium-imposed stress were not consistently impaired. The recovery of marker proteins during synaptosome preparation was the same, ruling out the possibility that the lack of functional bioenergetic defects in synaptosomes from J20 mice was due to the selective loss of damaged synaptosomes during sample preparation. Our results support the conclusion that the intrinsic bioenergetic capacities of presynaptic nerve terminals are maintained in these symptomatic AD mouse models.

23178035|t|Amyloid positron emission tomography with (18)F-flutemetamol and structural magnetic resonance imaging in the classification of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.
23178035|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the contributions of amyloid-positive (Am+) and medial temporal atrophy-positive (MTA+) scans to the diagnostic classification of prodromal and probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: (18)F-flutemetamol-labeled amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were used to classify 10 young normal, 15 elderly normal, 20 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and 27 AD subjects. MTA+ status was determined using a cut point derived from a previous study, and Am+ status was determined using a conservative and liberal cut point. RESULTS: The rates of MRI scans with positive results among young normal, elderly normal, aMCI, and AD subjects were 0%, 20%, 75%, and 82%, respectively. Using conservative cut points, the rates of Am+ scans for these same groups of subjects were 0%, 7%, 50%, and 93%, respectively, with the aMCI group showing the largest discrepancy between Am+ and MTA+ scans. Among aMCI cases, 80% of Am+ subjects were also MTA+, and 70% of amyloid-negative (Am-) subjects were MTA+. The combination of amyloid PET and MTA data was additive, with an overall correct classification rate for aMCI of 86%, when a liberal cut point (standard uptake value ratio = 1.4) was used for amyloid positivity. INTERPRETATION: (18)F-flutemetamol PET and structural MRI provided additive information in the diagnostic classification of aMCI subjects, suggesting an amyloid-independent neurodegenerative component among aMCI subjects in this sample.

23178247|t|Inhibition of IL-12/IL-23 signaling reduces Alzheimer's disease-like pathology and cognitive decline.
23178247|a|The pathology of Alzheimer's disease has an inflammatory component that is characterized by upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, particularly in response to amyloid-beta (Abeta). Using the APPPS1 Alzheimer's disease mouse model, we found increased production of the common interleukin-12 (IL-12) and IL-23 subunit p40 by microglia. Genetic ablation of the IL-12/IL-23 signaling molecules p40, p35 or p19, in which deficiency of p40 or its receptor complex had the strongest effect, resulted in decreased cerebral amyloid load. Although deletion of IL-12/IL-23 signaling from the radiation-resistant glial compartment of the brain was most efficient in mitigating cerebral amyloidosis, peripheral administration of a neutralizing p40-specific antibody likewise resulted in a reduction of cerebral amyloid load in APPPS1 mice. Furthermore, intracerebroventricular delivery of antibodies to p40 significantly reduced the concentration of soluble Abeta species and reversed cognitive deficits in aged APPPS1 mice. The concentration of p40 was also increased in the cerebrospinal fluid of subjects with Alzheimer's disease, which suggests that inhibition of the IL-12/IL-23 pathway may attenuate Alzheimer's disease pathology and cognitive deficits.

23178660|t|Cholinergic degeneration is associated with increased plaque deposition and cognitive impairment in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice.
23178660|a|Cholinergic dysfunction and deposition of plaques containing amyloid beta-peptides (Abeta) are two of the characteristics of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we combine APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice with the cholinergic immunotoxin mu p75-saporin (SAP) to integrate partial basal forebrain cholinergic degeneration and the neuropathology of APP/PS1 mice. By 6 months of age, APP/PS1 mice and wild type littermates (Wt) received intracerebroventricular injection of 0.6 mug SAP (lesion) or PBS (sham). Two months following surgery, APP/PS1 mice treated with SAP were significantly impaired compared to sham treated APP/PS1 mice in a behavioural paradigm addressing working memory. Conversely, the performance of Wt mice was unaffected by SAP treatment. Choline acetyltransferase activity was reduced in the hippocampus and frontal cortex following SAP treatment. The selective effect of a mild SAP lesion in APP/PS1 mice was not due to a more extensive cholinergic degeneration since the reduction in choline acetyltransferase activity was similar following SAP treatment in APP/PS1 mice and Wt. Interestingly, plaque load was significantly increased in SAP treated APP/PS1 mice relative to sham lesioned APP/PS1 mice. Additionally, APP/PS1 mice treated with SAP showed a tendency towards an increased level of soluble and insoluble Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 measured in brain tissue homogenate. Our results suggest that the combination of cholinergic degeneration and Abeta overexpression in the APP/PS1 mouse model results in cognitive decline and accelerated plaque burden. SAP treated APP/PS1 mice might thus constitute an improved model of Alzheimer's disease-like neuropathology and cognitive deficits compared to the conventional APP/PS1 model without selective removal of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons.

23178937|t|beta amyloid protein precursor-like (Appl) is a Ras1/MAPK-regulated gene required for axonal targeting in Drosophila photoreceptor neurons.
23178937|a|In a genome-wide expression profile search for genes required for Drosophila R7 photoreceptor development we found beta amyloid protein precursor-like (Appl), the ortholog of human APP, which is a key factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. We analyzed Appl expression in the eye imaginal disc and found that is highly accumulated in R7 photoreceptor cells. The R7 photoreceptor is responsible for UV light detection. To explore the link between high expression of Appl and R7 function, we have analyzed Appl null mutants and found reduced preference for UV light, probably because of mistargeted R7 axons. Moreover, axon mistargeting and inappropriate light discrimination are enhanced in combination with neurotactin mutants. R7 differentiation is triggered by the inductive interaction between R8 and R7 precursors, which results in a burst of Ras1/MAPK, activated by the tyrosine kinase receptor Sevenless. Therefore, we examined whether Ras1/MAPK is responsible for the high Appl expression. Inhibition of Ras1 signaling leads to reduced Appl expression, whereas constitutive activation drives ectopic Appl expression. We show that Appl is directly regulated by the Ras/MAPK pathway through a mechanism mediated by PntP2, an ETS transcription factor that specifically binds ETS sites in the Appl regulatory region. We also found that zebrafish appb expression increased after ectopic fgfr activation in the neural tube of zebrafish embryos, suggesting a conserved regulatory mechanism.

23181273|t|Tetrahydroxystilbene glucoside improves the learning and memory of amyloid-beta(1-42)-injected rats and may be connected to synaptic changes in the hippocampus.
23181273|a|The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effects of 2,3,5,4'-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-beta-D-glucoside (TSG), an active component extracted from Polygonum multiflorum, on learning/memory deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We randomly divided 24 male Sprague-Dawley rats among 4 groups: (i) the sham-operated group (control); (ii) sham-operated group also treated with TSG (sham+TSG); (iii) beta amyloid treated group (Abeta); and (iv) Abeta treatment group also treated with TSG (Abeta+TSG). Rats in the Abeta and Abeta+TSG groups were treated with Abeta1-42 intracerebroventricularly, whereas the control and sham+TSG groups were given phosphate-buffered saline. Rats in the sham+TSG and Abeta+TSG groups were then treated intragastrically with TSG (50 mg (kg body mass)-1 day-1) for 4 weeks, and rats in the Abeta and control groups were treated with saline. The results from Morris water maze tests, electron microscopy, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and Western blotting demonstrated that Abeta1-42 induced impairment in learning and memory, degeneration in synaptic structures, and downregulation of Src and NR2B at the gene and protein level, respectively. These alterations were reversed by the administration of TSG, suggesting that TSG exerts anti-AD properties by protecting synaptic structure and function. TSG-induced upregulation of Src and NR2B may be responsible for this process.

23181502|t|Cyanobacterial peptides as a prototype for the design of potent beta-secretase inhibitors and the development of selective chemical probes for other aspartic proteases.
23181502|a|Inspired by marine cyanobacterial natural products, we synthesized modified peptides with a central statine-core unit, characteristic for aspartic protease inhibition. A series of tasiamide B analogues inhibited BACE1, a therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease. We probed the stereospecificity of target engagement and determined additional structure-activity relationships with respect to BACE1 and related aspartic proteases, cathepsins D and E. We cocrystallized selected inhibitors with BACE1 to reveal the structural basis for the activity. Hybrid molecules that combine features of tasiamide B and an isophthalic acid moiety-containing sulfonamide showed nanomolar cellular activity. Compounds were screened in a series of rigorous complementary cell-based assays. We measured secreted APP ectodomain (sAPPbeta), membrane bound carboxyl terminal fragment (CTF), levels of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides and selectivity for beta-secretase (BACE1) over gamma-secretase. Prioritized compounds showed reasonable stability in vitro and in vivo, and our most potent inhibitor showed efficacy in reducing Abeta levels in the rodent brain.

23182244|t|Alzheimer brain-derived amyloid beta-protein impairs synaptic remodeling and memory consolidation.
23182244|a|Aggregation of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) is believed to play a central role in initiating the molecular cascade that culminates in Alzheimer-type dementia (AD), a disease which in its early stage is characterized by synaptic loss and impairment of episodic memory. Here we show that intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta-containing water-soluble extracts of AD brain inhibits consolidation of the memory of avoidance learning in the rat and that this effect is highly dependent on the interval between learning and administration. When injected at 1 hour post training extracts from 2 different AD brains significantly impaired recall tested at 48 hours. Ultrastructural examination of hippocampi from animals perfused after 48 hours revealed that Abeta-mediated impairment of avoidance memory was associated with lower density of synapses and altered synaptic structure in the dentate gyrus and CA1 fields. These behavioral and ultrastructural data suggest that human brain-derived Abeta impairs formation of long-term memory by compromising the structural plasticity essential for consolidation and that Abeta targets processes initiated very early in the consolidation pathway.

23183235|t|Protection of primary neurons and mouse brain from Alzheimer's pathology by molecular tweezers.
23183235|a|Alzheimer's disease is a devastating cureless neurodegenerative disorder affecting >35 million people worldwide. The disease is caused by toxic oligomers and aggregates of amyloid beta protein and the microtubule-associated protein tau. Recently, the Lys-specific molecular tweezer CLR01 has been shown to inhibit aggregation and toxicity of multiple amyloidogenic proteins, including amyloid beta protein and tau, by disrupting key interactions involved in the assembly process. Following up on these encouraging findings, here, we asked whether CLR01 could protect primary neurons from Alzheimer's disease-associated synaptotoxicity and reduce Alzheimer's disease-like pathology in vivo. Using cell culture and brain slices, we found that CLR01 effectively inhibited synaptotoxicity induced by the 42-residue isoform of amyloid beta protein, including ~80% inhibition of changes in dendritic spines density and long-term potentiation and complete inhibition of changes in basal synaptic activity. Using a radiolabelled version of the compound, we found that CLR01 crossed the mouse blood-brain barrier at ~2% of blood levels. Treatment of 15-month-old triple-transgenic mice for 1 month with CLR01 resulted in a decrease in brain amyloid beta protein aggregates, hyperphosphorylated tau and microglia load as observed by immunohistochemistry. Importantly, no signs of toxicity were observed in the treated mice, and CLR01 treatment did not affect the amyloidogenic processing of amyloid beta protein precursor. Examining induction or inhibition of the cytochrome P450 metabolism system by CLR01 revealed minimal interaction. Together, these data suggest that CLR01 is safe for use at concentrations well above those showing efficacy in mice. The efficacy and toxicity results support a process-specific mechanism of action of molecular tweezers and suggest that these are promising compounds for developing disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer's disease and related disorders.

23183882|t|Deciphering the mechanism underlying late-onset Alzheimer disease.
23183882|a|Despite tremendous investments in understanding the complex molecular mechanisms underlying Alzheimer disease (AD), recent clinical trials have failed to show efficacy. A potential problem underlying these failures is the assumption that the molecular mechanism mediating the genetically determined form of the disease is identical to the one resulting in late-onset AD. Here, we integrate experimental evidence outside the 'spotlight' of the genetic drivers of amyloid-beta (Abeta) generation published during the past two decades, and present a mechanistic explanation for the pathophysiological changes that characterize late-onset AD. We propose that chronic inflammatory conditions cause dysregulation of mechanisms to clear misfolded or damaged neuronal proteins that accumulate with age, and concomitantly lead to tau-associated impairments of axonal integrity and transport. Such changes have several neuropathological consequences: focal accumulation of mitochondria, resulting in metabolic impairments; induction of axonal swelling and leakage, followed by destabilization of synaptic contacts; deposition of amyloid precursor protein in swollen neurites, and generation of aggregation-prone peptides; further tau hyperphosphorylation, ultimately resulting in neurofibrillary tangle formation and neuronal death. The proposed sequence of events provides a link between Abeta and tau-related neuropathology, and underscores the concept that degenerating neurites represent a cause rather than a consequence of Abeta accumulation in late-onset AD.

23183885|t|Preclinical Alzheimer disease-the challenges ahead.
23183885|a|There is growing recognition that the pathophysiological process of Alzheimer disease (AD) begins many years prior to clinically obvious symptoms, and the concept of a presymptomatic or preclinical stage of AD is becoming more widely accepted. Advances in biomarker studies have enabled detection of AD pathology in vivo in clinically normal older individuals. The predictive value of these biomarkers at the individual patient level, however, remains to be elucidated. The ultimate goal of identifying individuals in the preclinical stages of AD is to facilitate early intervention to delay and perhaps even prevent emergence of the clinical syndrome. A number of challenges remain to be overcome before this concept can be validated and translated into clinical practice.

23184970|t|Direct three-dimensional visualization of membrane disruption by amyloid fibrils.
23184970|a|Protein misfolding and aggregation cause serious degenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson, and prion diseases. Damage to membranes is thought to be one of the mechanisms underlying cellular toxicity of a range of amyloid assemblies. Previous studies have indicated that amyloid fibrils can cause membrane leakage and elicit cellular damage, and these effects are enhanced by fragmentation of the fibrils. Here we report direct 3D visualization of membrane damage by specific interactions of a lipid bilayer with amyloid-like fibrils formed in vitro from beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)m). Using cryoelectron tomography, we demonstrate that fragmented beta(2)m amyloid fibrils interact strongly with liposomes and cause distortions to the membranes. The normally spherical liposomes form pointed teardrop-like shapes with the fibril ends seen in proximity to the pointed regions on the membranes. Moreover, the tomograms indicated that the fibrils extract lipid from the membranes at these points of distortion by removal or blebbing of the outer membrane leaflet. Tiny (15-25 nm) vesicles, presumably formed from the extracted lipids, were observed to be decorating the fibrils. The findings highlight a potential role of fibrils, and particularly fibril ends, in amyloid pathology, and report a previously undescribed class of lipid-protein interactions in membrane remodelling.

23195115|t|Whole body exposure to 2.4 GHz WIFI signals: effects on cognitive impairment in adult triple transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (3xTg-AD).
23195115|a|The present investigation aimed at evaluating the effects of long-term exposure to WIFI type radiofrequency (RF) signals (2.40 GHz), two hours per day during one month at a Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) of 1.60 W/kg. The effects of RF exposure were studied on wildtype mice and triple transgenic mice (3xTg-AD) destined to develop Alzheimer's-like cognitive impairment. Mice were divided into four groups: two sham groups (WT, TG; n=7) and two exposed groups (WTS, TGS; n=7). The cognitive interference task used in this study was designed from an analogous human cognitive interference task including the Flex field activity system test, the two-compartment box test and the Barnes maze test. Our data demonstrate for the first time that RF improves cognitive behavior of 3xTg-AD mice. We conclude that RF exposure may represent an effective memory-enhancing approach in Alzheimer's disease.

23197718|t|SRPK2 phosphorylates tau and mediates the cognitive defects in Alzheimer's disease.
23197718|a|Serine-arginine protein kinases 2 (SRPK2) is a cell cycle-regulated kinase that phosphorylates serine/arginine domain-containing proteins and mediates pre-mRNA splicing with unclear function in neurons. Here, we show that SRPK2 phosphorylates tau on S214, suppresses tau-dependent microtubule polymerization, and inhibits axonal elongation in neurons. Depletion of SRPK2 in dentate gyrus inhibits tau phosphorylation in APP/PS1 mouse and alleviates the impaired cognitive behaviors. The defective LTP in APP/PS1 mice is also improved after SRPK2 depletion. Moreover, active SRPK2 is increased in the cortex of APP/PS1 mice and the pathological structures of human Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. Therefore, our study suggests SRPK2 may contribute to the formation of hyperphosphorylated tau and the pathogenesis of AD.

23197721|t|Alzheimer's disease: presenilin 2-sparing gamma-secretase inhibition is a tolerable Abeta peptide-lowering strategy.
23197721|a|gamma-Secretase inhibition represents a major therapeutic strategy for lowering amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide production in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Progress toward clinical use of gamma-secretase inhibitors has, however, been hampered due to mechanism-based adverse events, primarily related to impairment of Notch signaling. The gamma-secretase inhibitor MRK-560 represents an exception as it is largely tolerable in vivo despite displaying only a small selectivity between Abeta production and Notch signaling in vitro. In exploring the molecular basis for the observed tolerability, we show that MRK-560 displays a strong preference for the presenilin 1 (PS1) over PS2 subclass of gamma-secretases and is tolerable in wild-type mice but causes dose-dependent Notch-related side effect in PS2-deficient mice at drug exposure levels resulting in a substantial decrease in brain Abeta levels. This demonstrates that PS2 plays an important role in mediating essential Notch signaling in several peripheral organs during pharmacological inhibition of PS1 and provide preclinical in vivo proof of concept for PS2-sparing inhibition as a novel, tolerable and efficacious gamma-secretase targeting strategy for AD.

23197725|t|Soluble abeta promotes wild-type tau pathology in vivo.
23197725|a|Growing evidence suggests that soluble Abeta species can drive Alzheimer disease (AD) pathogenesis by inducing a cascade of events including tau hyperphosphorylation, proteasome impairment, and synaptic dysfunction. However, these studies have relied largely on in vitro approaches to examine the role of soluble Abeta in AD. In particular, it remains unknown whether soluble Abeta oligomers can facilitate the development of human wild-type tau pathology in vivo. To address this question, we developed a novel transgenic model that expresses low levels of APP with the Arctic familial AD mutation to enhance soluble Abeta oligomer formation in conjunction with wild-type human tau. Using a genetic approach, we show that reduction of beta-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE) in these ArcTau mice decreases soluble Abeta oligomers, rescues cognition, and, more importantly, reduces tau accumulation and phosphorylation. Notably, BACE reduction decreases the postsynaptic mislocalization of tau in ArcTau mice and reduces the association between NMDA receptors and PSD-95. These studies provide critical in vivo evidence for a strong mechanistic link between soluble Abeta, wild-type tau, and synaptic pathology.

23197731|t|Beta amyloid-induced depression of hippocampal long-term potentiation is mediated through the amylin receptor.
23197731|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) in the brain regions that subserve memory and cognition. The amylin receptor is a potential target receptor for expression of the deleterious actions of soluble oligomeric Abeta species. We investigated whether the amylin receptor antagonist, AC253, neutralizes the depressant effects of Abeta(1-42) and human amylin on hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). Furthermore, we examined whether depressed levels of LTP observed in transgenic mice, which overexpress amyloid precursor protein (TgCRND8), could be restored with AC253. In mouse hippocampal brain slices, field EPSPs were recorded from the stratum radiatum layer of the CA1 area (cornu ammonis 1 region of the hippocampus) in response to electrical stimulation of Schaeffer collateral afferents. LTP was induced by 3-theta burst stimulation protocols. Abeta(1-42) (50 nM) and human amylin (50 nM), but not Abeta(42-1) (50 nM), depressed LTP evoked using both stimulation protocols. Preapplication of AC253 (250 nM) blocked Abeta- and human amylin-induced reduction of LTP without affecting baseline transmission or LTP on its own. In contrast to wild-type controls, where robust LTP is observed, 6- to 12-month-old TgCRND8 mice show blunted LTP that is significantly enhanced by application of AC253. Our data demonstrate that the effects of Abeta(1-42) and human amylin on LTP are expressed via the amylin receptor, and moreover, blockade of this receptor increases LTP in transgenic mice that show increased brain amyloid burden. Amylin receptor antagonists could serve as potentially useful therapeutic agents in AD.

23200245|t|Investigating the binding interactions of galantamine with beta-amyloid peptide.
23200245|a|The anti-Alzheimer's agent galantamine is known to possess anti-amyloid properties. However the exact mechanisms are not clear. We studied the binding interactions of galantamine with amyloid peptide dimer (Abeta(1-40)) through molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Galantamine's binding site within the amyloid peptide dimer was identified by docking experiments and the most stable complex was analyzed by molecular dynamics simulation. These studies show that galantamine was interacting with the central region of the amyloid dimer (Lys16-Ala21) and the C-terminal region (Ile31-Val36) with minimum structural drift of Calpha atom in those regions. Strikingly, a significant drift was observed at the turn region from Asp23-Gly29 (Calpha atom RMSD=9.2 A and 11.6 A at 50 fs and 100 fs respectively). Furthermore, galantamine's binding mode disrupts the key pi-pi stacking interaction between aromatic rings of Phe19 (chain A) and Phe19 (chain B) and intermolecular hydrogen bonds seen in unbound peptide dimer. Noticeably, the azepine tertiary nitrogen of galantamine was in close proximity to backbone CO of Leu34 (distance <3.5 A) to stabilize the dimer conformation. In summary, the results indicate that galantamine binding to amyloid peptide dimer leads to a significant conformational change at the turn region (Asp23-Gly29) that disrupts interactions between individual beta-strands and promotes a nontoxic conformation of Abeta(1-40) to prevent the formation of neurotoxic oligomers.

23201341|t|The influence of inhibiting or stimulating the expression of the alpha3 subunit of the nicotinic receptor in SH-SY5Y cells on levels of amyloid-beta peptide and beta-secretase.
23201341|a|To examine the effects of the alpha3 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) on the expression of beta-secretase and the concomitant level of amyloid-beta (Abeta), SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were either transfected with small interference RNAs (siRNAs) specifically targeting this subunit or exposed to nicotine. The levels of alpha3 nAChR mRNA and protein, as well as the corresponding levels of BACE1 (which cleaves the beta-site of APP) and BACE2 (cleaving in the Abeta domain) were determined by real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively. The levels of Abeta(1-42) in culture media were determined by an Elisa procedure. In SH-SY5Y cells transfected with siRNA, the levels of alpha3 nAChR mRNA and protein were reduced by 96% and 88%, respectively; the levels of BACE1 mRNA and protein were significantly enhanced, while those of BACE2 were reduced; and the level of Abeta in the culture medium was elevated. In contrast, when untransfected SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to nicotine, the levels of both alpha3 nAChR mRNA and protein were enhanced; while the levels of BACE1 mRNA and protein were diminished and the corresponding levels of BACE2 enhanced; and the level of Abeta in the culture medium was attenuated. These results indicate that the alpha3 subunit of nAChR inhibits the production of Abeta by reducing the expression of BACE1 and elevating the expression of BACE2, suggesting that this subunit might play an important neuroprotective role in connection with the pathogenesis of AD.

23201360|t|Dietary supplementation with Salvia sahendica attenuates memory deficits, modulates CREB and its down-stream molecules and decreases apoptosis in amyloid beta-injected rats.
23201360|a|Herein, we investigated the effect Salvia sahendica (S. sahenica) extract, an endemic plant of Iran on the improvement of learning and memory deficits in amyloid beta-(Abeta) injected rats. In order to test this hypothesis, we pretreated rats with S. sahendica 1 week prior to Abeta injection, then performed Morris water maze test. Besides, we studied the molecular factors involved in neuronal plasticity and apoptosis such as Ca(2+)/cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB), c-fos, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha), Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and caspase-3. Moreover, we used Terminal-Transferase dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) technique to detect apoptosis in the hippocampus of Abeta-injected rats. Results showed that S. sahendica could improve learning and memory in the behavioral test. The results of molecular section showed that CREB, c-fos and PGC-1alpha levels attenuated in the Abeta-injected rats in comparison with control group. These decreases were attenuated 58, 62, 57% respectively in S. sahendica-pretreated rats. This dietary supplementation could decrease apoptotic factors including caspase-3, PARP and TUNEL positive cells as well. Collectively, the present result from behavioral testing and biochemical analysis demonstrated that S. sahendica treatment for 1 week protected against apoptosis and memory deficits in Abeta-injected rats.

23201910|t|Roles of the amyloid precursor protein family in the peripheral nervous system.
23201910|a|Compelling evidence from in vivo model systems within the past decade shows that the APP family of proteins is important for synaptic development and function in the central and peripheral nervous systems. The synaptic role promises to be complex and multifaceted for several reasons. The three family members have overlapping and redundant functions in mammals. They have both adhesive and signaling properties and may, in principle, act as both ligands and receptors. Moreover, they bind a multitude of synapse-specific proteins, and we predict that additional interacting protein partners will be discovered. Transgenic mice with modified or abolished expression of APP and APLPs have synaptic defects that are readily apparent. Studies of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in these transgenic mice have revealed molecular and functional deficits in neurotransmitter release, in organization of the postsynaptic receptors, and in coordinated intercellular development. The results summarized here from invertebrate and vertebrate systems confirm that the NMJ with its accessibility, large size, and homogeneity provides a model synapse for identifying and analyzing molecular pathways of APP actions.

23201920|t|Alzheimer's disease and Down's syndrome: treating two paths to dementia.
23201920|a|Successful therapy of dementia, like any disease, depends upon understanding its pathogenesis. This review contrasts the dominant pathways to dementia which differ in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in Down's syndrome (DS). Impaired clearance of neurotoxic amyloid beta peptides (Abeta) leads to dementia in AD. In DS over-production of Abeta plays the dominant role in the development of dementia. It follows, therefore, that the therapy of AD and DS should reflect a different balance between the dominant agent that inhibits the synthesis of Abeta in the brain in AD and increase the clearance of Abeta from the cerebrospinal DS.

23202293|t|beta-arrestin 2 regulates Abeta generation and gamma-secretase activity in Alzheimer's disease.
23202293|a|beta-arrestins are associated with numerous aspects of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling and regulation and accordingly influence diverse physiological and pathophysiological processes. Here we report that beta-arrestin 2 expression is elevated in two independent cohorts of individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Overexpression of beta-arrestin 2 leads to an increase in amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide generation, whereas genetic silencing of Arrb2 (encoding beta-arrestin 2) reduces generation of Abeta in cell cultures and in Arrb2(-/-) mice. Moreover, in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, genetic deletion of Arrb2 leads to a reduction in the production of Abeta(40) and Abeta(42). Two GPCRs implicated previously in Alzheimer's disease (GPR3 and the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor) mediate their effects on Abeta generation through interaction with beta-arrestin 2. beta-arrestin 2 physically associates with the Aph-1a subunit of the gamma-secretase complex and redistributes the complex toward detergent-resistant membranes, increasing the catalytic activity of the complex. Collectively, these studies identify beta-arrestin 2 as a new therapeutic target for reducing amyloid pathology and GPCR dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.

23204056|t|Brain and circulating levels of Abeta1-40 differentially contribute to vasomotor dysfunction in the mouse brain.
23204056|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Amyloid-beta (Abeta), a peptide that accumulates in the brain and circulates in the blood of patients with Alzheimer disease, alters the regulation of cerebral blood flow and may contribute to the brain dysfunction underlying the dementia. However, the contributions of brain and circulating Abeta1-40 to the vascular dysfunction have not been elucidated. METHODS: We used transgenic mice overexpressing mutated forms of the amyloid precursor protein in which Abeta1-40 is elevated in blood and brain (Tg-2576) or only in brain (Tg-SwDI). Mice were equipped with a cranial window, and the increase in cerebral blood flow induced by neural activity (whisker stimulation), or by topical application of endothelium-dependent vasodilators, was assessed by laser-Doppler flowmetry. RESULTS: The cerebrovascular dysfunction was observed also in Tg-SwDI mice, but despite  40% higher levels of brain Abeta1-40, the effect was less marked than in Tg-2576 mice. Intravascular administration of Abeta1-40 elevated plasma Abeta1-40 and enhanced the dysfunction in Tg-SwDI mice, but not in Tg-2576 mice. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide evidence that Abeta1-40 acts on distinct luminal and abluminal vascular targets, the deleterious cerebrovascular effects of which are additive. Furthermore, the findings highlight the importance of circulating Abeta1-40 in the cerebrovascular dysfunction and may provide insight into the cerebrovascular alterations in conditions in which elevations in plasma Abeta1-40 occur.

23206502|t|Uncoupling of M1 muscarinic receptor/G-protein interaction by amyloid beta(1-42).
23206502|a|The overproduction of beta-amyloid (Abeta) fragments in transgenic APPswe/PS1dE9 mice results in formation of amyloid deposits in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus starting around four months of age and leading to cognitive impairment much later. We have previously found an age and transgene-dependent weakening of muscarinic receptor-mediated transmission that was not present in young (6-10-week-old) animals but preceded both amyloid deposits and cognitive deficits. Now we investigated immediate and prolonged in vitro effects of non-aggregated Abeta(1-42) on coupling of individual muscarinic receptor subtypes expressed in CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells and their underlying mechanisms. Immediate application of 1 muM Abeta(1-42) had no effect on the binding of the muscarinic antagonist N-methylscopolamine or the agonist carbachol. In contrast, 4-day treatment of CHO cells expressing the M1 muscarinic receptor with 100 nM Abeta(1-42) significantly changed the binding characteristics of the muscarinic agonist carbachol and reduced the extent of the M1 receptor-stimulated breakdown of phosphatidylinositol while it did not demonstrate overt toxic effects. The treatment had no influence on the expression of either G-proteins or muscarinic receptors. In concert, we found no change in the gene expression of muscarinic receptor subtypes and gene or protein expression of the G(s), G(q/11), and G(i/o) G-proteins in the cerebral cortex of young adult APPswe/PS1dE9 mice that demonstrate high concentrations of soluble Abeta(1-42) and impaired muscarinic receptor-mediated G-protein activation. Our results provide strong evidence that the initial injurious effects of Abeta(1-42) on M1 muscarinic receptor-mediated transmissionis is due to compromised coupling of the receptor with G(q/11) G-protein.

23207768|t|Effects of clioquinol analogues on the hypoxia-inducible factor pathway and intracelullar mobilization of metal ions.
23207768|a|We previously found that clioquinol (CQ) increases functional hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) with enhanced transcription of its target genes. Here we report that compounds derived from 8-hydroxyquinoline including CQ, broxyquinoline (BQ), iodoquinol (IQ) and chloroacetoxyquinoline (CAQ) promote neovascularization effectively based on chick chorioallantoic membrane assays. The CQ analogues induce stabilization of HIF-1alpha as well as enhance HIF-1-mediated vascular endothelial growth factor transcription. These analogues also exert inhibitory effects on the activity of prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylations of HIF-1alpha in vitro. Despite metal ion-dependent restoration of the inhibited HIF-1alpha hydroxylase activity, the cellular HIF-1alpha-inducing effects of the CQ analogues are reversed to varying degrees by Zn(2+) and Fe(2+). While CQ and BQ are completely reversed by Zn(2+), co-administration of Zn(2+) and IQ has only a partial reversing effect. On the other hand, CAQ-mediated stabilization of HIF-1alpha is reversed by Fe(2+) but not by Zn(2+). These phenomena are found to coincide with elevation of the intracellular Zn(2+) and Fe(2+) levels by the CQ analogues, suggesting that metal ion effects on HIF-1alpha in cells likely reflect the differential transporting capability of the analogues.

23208420|t|beta-arrestin1 regulates gamma-secretase complex assembly and modulates amyloid-beta pathology.
23208420|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and complex neurodegenerative disease in which the gamma-secretase-mediated amyloid-beta (Abeta) pathology plays an important role. We found that a multifunctional protein, beta-arrestin1, facilitated the formation of NCT/APH-1 (anterior pharynx-defective phenotype 1) precomplex and mature gamma-secretase complex through its functional interaction with APH-1. Deficiency of beta-arrestin1 or inhibition of binding of beta-arrestin1 with APH-1 by small peptides reduced Abeta production without affecting Notch processing. Genetic ablation of beta-arrestin1 diminished Abeta pathology and behavioral deficits in transgenic AD mice. Moreover, in brains of sporadic AD patients and transgenic AD mice, the expression of beta-arrestin1 was upregulated and correlated well with neuropathological severity and senile Abeta plaques. Thus, our study identifies a regulatory mechanism underlying both gamma-secretase assembly and AD pathogenesis, and indicates that specific reduction of Abeta pathology can be achieved by regulation of the gamma-secretase assembly.

23209290|t|The role of gamma-secretase activating protein (GSAP) and imatinib in the regulation of gamma-secretase activity and amyloid-beta generation.
23209290|a|gamma-Secretase is a large enzyme complex comprising presenilin, nicastrin, presenilin enhancer 2, and anterior pharynx-defective 1 that mediates the intramembrane proteolysis of a large number of proteins including amyloid precursor protein and Notch. Recently, a novel gamma-secretase activating protein (GSAP) was identified that interacts with gamma-secretase and the C-terminal fragment of amyloid precursor protein to selectively increase amyloid-beta production. In this study we have further characterized the role of endogenous and exogenous GSAP in the regulation of gamma-secretase activity and amyloid-beta production in vitro. Knockdown of GSAP expression in N2a cells decreased amyloid-beta levels. In contrast, overexpression of GSAP in HEK cells expressing amyloid precursor protein or in N2a cells had no overt effect on amyloid-beta generation. Likewise, purified recombinant GSAP had no effect on amyloid-beta generation in two distinct in vitro gamma-secretase assays. In subsequent cellular studies with imatinib, a kinase inhibitor that reportedly prevents the interaction of GSAP with the C-terminal fragment of amyloid precursor protein, a concentration-dependent decrease in amyloid-beta levels was observed. However, no interaction between GSAP and the C-terminal fragment of amyloid precursor protein was evident in co-immunoprecipitation studies. In addition, subchronic administration of imatinib to rats had no effect on brain amyloid-beta levels. In summary, these findings suggest the roles of GSAP and imatinib in the regulation of gamma-secretase activity and amyloid-beta generation are uncertain.

23210549|t|Inhibition of gamma-secretase activity by a monoclonal antibody against the extracellular hydrophilic loop of presenilin 1.
23210549|a|Presenilin 1 (PS1) comprises a catalytic subunit of gamma-secretase, which is an intramembrane-cleaving protease responsible for generation of amyloid-beta peptides as well as Notch cleavage, the latter being implicated in cancer. We have shown that transmembrane domains (TMDs) 1, 6, 7, and 9 of PS1 form the "catalytic pore" structure within the membrane for intramembrane proteolysis. Here we report a novel monoclonal antibody 9D11, which directly recognizes the TMD1-proximal residues in the hydrophilic loop region. Intriguingly, 9D11 inhibited the gamma-secretase activity irrespective of the binding of known gamma-secretase inhibitors and abolished Notch signaling-dependent cancer cell viability. Our data suggest that the juxtamembrane region of TMD1 of PS1 is a novel molecular target for the mechanism-based inhibition of gamma-secretase and the development of the anticancer drug.

23212456|t|Altered concentrations of amyloid precursor protein metabolites in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with bipolar disorder.
23212456|a|Bipolar disorder is a psychiatric disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of mania/hypomania and depression. Progressive cognitive dysfunction such as impairments in executive function and verbal memory is common in euthymic bipolar patients. The cerebrospinal fluid has previously been used to study neurodegenerative processes in Alzheimer's disease, from which changes in three core biomarkers have emerged as indicative of degeneration: amyloid beta, total tau, and hyperphosphorylated tau. Here, neurodegeneration in bipolar disorder was investigated by assessing the association between bipolar disorder and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for neurodegenerative processes. Cerebrospinal fluid was obtained from 139 bipolar disorder patients and 71 healthy controls. Concentrations of total and phosphorylated tau, amyloid beta1-42, amyloid beta38/beta40/beta42, and the soluble forms of amyloid precursor protein were measured in patients vs controls. The concentrations of the soluble forms of amyloid precursor protein were significantly lower in bipolar patients compared with controls. The amyloid beta42/amyloid beta38 and the amyloid beta42/amyloid beta40 ratios were higher in bipolar patients than controls. There were no discernible differences in the concentrations of total/phosphorylated tau, amyloid beta1-42, or amyloid beta38/beta40/beta42. The concentrations of the biomarkers within the bipolar patient group were further associated with different ongoing medical treatments and diagnostic subgroups. The findings suggest that the amyloid precursor protein metabolism is altered in bipolar disorder. The results may have implications for the understanding of the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder and for the development of treatment strategies. Importantly, there were no signs of an Alzheimer-like neurodegenerative process among bipolar patients.

23212641|t|Neuroprotective effect of edible brown alga Eisenia bicyclis on amyloid beta peptide-induced toxicity in PC12 cells.
23212641|a|Amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) oligomers increase intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium cation (Ca(2+)) concentrations, which causes neuronal cell death in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, the use of neuroprotective agents with antioxidative activity might be effective in the treatment of AD. In the present study, the neuroprotective effects of the methanol extract from edible brown alga Eisenia bicyclis (Laminariaceae) and its solvent soluble fractions together with the isolated phlorotannins on Abeta-induced toxicity were assessed by cell viability, intracellular ROS, and Ca(2+) levels in PC12 cells. The addition of the methanol extract as well as its ethyl acetate and n-butanol fractions of E. bicyclis markedly reversed the Abeta-induced toxicity. Among six phlorotannins, including phloroglucinol (1), dioxinodehydroeckol (2), eckol (3), phlorofucofuroeckol A (4), dieckol (5), and 7-phloroeckol (6), isolated from the most active ethyl acetate fraction, 3-6 significantly decreased Abeta-induced cell death. Furthermore, these compounds also inhibited intracellular ROS generation and Ca(2+) generation, indicating the neuroprotective effects may be mediated through reduced intracellular ROS and Ca(2+) generation. Thus, the results of the present study imply that E. bicyclis and its active components attenuated the oxidative stress and reduced neuronal cell death, suggesting that it may be used as a dietary neuroprotective agent in AD.

23213214|t|Out-of-register beta-sheets suggest a pathway to toxic amyloid aggregates.
23213214|a|Although aberrant protein aggregation has been conclusively linked to dozens of devastating amyloid diseases, scientists remain puzzled about the molecular features that render amyloid fibrils or small oligomers toxic. Here, we report a previously unobserved type of amyloid fibril that tests as cytotoxic: one in which the strands of the contributing beta-sheets are out of register. In all amyloid fibrils previously characterized at the molecular level, only in-register beta-sheets have been observed, in which each strand makes its full complement of hydrogen bonds with the strands above and below it in the fibril. In out-of-register sheets, strands are sheared relative to one another, leaving dangling hydrogen bonds. Based on this finding, we designed out-of-register beta-sheet amyloid mimics, which form both cylindrin-like oligomers and fibrils, and these mimics are cytotoxic. Structural and energetic considerations suggest that out-of-register fibrils can readily convert to toxic cylindrins. We propose that out-of-register beta-sheets and their related cylindrins are part of a toxic amyloid pathway, which is distinct from the more energetically favored in-register amyloid pathway.

23214446|t|Production of glycosylated soluble amyloid precursor protein alpha (sAPPalpha) in Leishmania tarentolae.
23214446|a|Soluble amyloid precursor protein alpha (sAPPalpha) is a cleavage product of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), the etiologic agent in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Reduced expression of sAPPalpha was previously found in the brains of AD patients, and it was suggested that sAPPalpha might counteract neurotoxic effects of Abeta, another APP cleavage product with enhanced abundance in Alzheimer's diseased brains. However, little is known about the biological functions of sAPPalpha. Thus, efficient production of this protein is a prerequisite for further studies. The unicellular eukaryotic parasite Leishmania tarentolae has recently emerged as a promising expression system for eukaryotic proteins due to its ability to posttranslationally modify proteins combined with easy cultivation and high protein yield. Interestingly, sAPPalpha produced in L. tarentolae was biologically active and glycosylated. In contrast to nonglycosylated sAPPalpha expressed in Eschericha coli, it also featured higher stability against enzymatic degradation. Detailed analysis of the glycosylation pattern of sAPPalpha produced in L. tarentolae by PGC-LC-ESI-MS/MS N-glycan analysis identified among eukaryotic species the highly conserved core pentasaccharide (Man3GlcNAc2) as being attached to Asn467 of sAPPalpha. Using oxonium ion scanning of CID-MS/MS spectra in combination with ETD fragmentation, we also identified two peptides (peptides 269-288 and 575-587) modified with N-acetyl hexosamine (HexNAc) residues. One of these O-glycosylation sites could be unambiguously assigned to Thr576 of sAPPalpha. This is the first time that O-glycosylation of a recombinant protein expressed in L. tarentolae has been demonstrated. Together, human sAPPalpha produced in L. tarentolae was N- and O-glycosylated on similar sites as described for mammalian-expressed sAPPalpha and showed similar biological activity. This demonstrates that L. tarentolae is a very suitable and simple to handle expression system for mammalian glycoproteins.

23217738|t|The neuropathology and neurobiology of traumatic brain injury.
23217738|a|The acute and long-term consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI) have received increased attention in recent years. In this Review, we discuss the neuropathology and neural mechanisms associated with TBI, drawing on findings from sports-induced TBI in athletes, in whom acute TBI damages axons and elicits both regenerative and degenerative tissue responses in the brain and in whom repeated concussions may initiate a long-term neurodegenerative process called dementia pugilistica or chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). We also consider how the neuropathology and neurobiology of CTE in many ways resembles other neurodegenerative illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease, particularly with respect to mismetabolism and aggregation of tau, beta-amyloid, and TDP-43. Finally, we explore how translational research in animal models of acceleration/deceleration types of injury relevant for concussion together with clinical studies employing imaging and biochemical markers may further elucidate the neurobiology of TBI and CTE.

23218605|t|Novel peptidomimetics as BACE-1 inhibitors: synthesis, molecular modeling, and biological studies.
23218605|a|Aiming at identifying new scaffolds for BACE-1 inhibition devoid of the pharmacokinetic drawbacks of peptide-like structures, we investigated a series of novel peptidomimetics based on a 1,4-benzodiazepine (BDZ) core 1a-h and their seco-analogues 2a-d. We herein discuss synthesis, molecular modeling and in vitro studies which, starting from 1a, led to the seco-analogues (R)-2c and (S)-2d endowed with BACE-1 inhibition properties in the micromolar range both on the isolated enzyme and in cellular studies. These data can encourage to pursue these analogues as hits for the development of a new series of BACE-1 inhibitors active on whole-cells.

23219895|t|An improved cell-based method for determining the gamma-secretase enzyme activity against both Notch and APP substrates.
23219895|a|gamma-Secretase modulators (GSM), which reduce amyloidogenic Abeta(42) production while maintaining total Abeta levels, and Notch-sparing gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) are promising therapies for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). To have a safety margin for therapeutic use, GSMs and GSIs need to allow Notch intracellular domain (NICD) production, while preventing neurotoxic Abeta peptide production. Typically, GSI and GSM effects on these substrates are determined using two different cell lines, one for the measurement of enzyme activity against each substrate. However, predicting selectivity for different substrates across cell systems may reduce the reliability of such ratios such that the in vitro data are not useful for predicting in vivo safety margins. This is especially concerning since the IC(50)'s of some GSIs vary depending upon the level of APP expression in a cell line. To circumvent this problem, we utilized the SUP-T1 cell line which expresses a truncated Notch receptor fragment that does not need sheddase cleavage to be a gamma-secretase substrate. When combined with a sensitive method of measuring Abeta production, this assay system allows both substrates to be measured simultaneously, reducing the potential to calculate imprecise selectivity margins. To demonstrate the value of this system, known GSIs and GSMs were examined in the SUP-T1 dual substrate assay. IC(50)'s were determined for both substrates and the in vitro selectivity margin was calculated. These data suggest using a single cell line is a more accurate prediction of the fold difference between NICD inhibition and Abeta(42) lowering for therapeutically promising GSIs and GSMs.

23223301|t|Mrp14 deficiency ameliorates amyloid beta burden by increasing microglial phagocytosis and modulation of amyloid precursor protein processing.
23223301|a|Neuroinflammation plays a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), resulting in the extensive activation of microglial and astroglial cells. Here we describe the role of myeloid-related protein Mrp14, a recently described amplifier of inflammation, in Alzheimer's disease and in the related amyloid precursor protein/presenilin1 (APP/PS1) mouse model. Detection of Mrp14 in control, mildly cognitive impaired, and AD patients revealed a strong induction of Mrp14 in protein extracts as well as in the cerebrospinal fluid, but not in blood plasma. In APP/PS1 mice, Mrp14 and its heterodimeric partner Mrp8 was found to be upregulated in microglial cells surrounding amyloid plaques. Functionally, loss of Mrp14 led to increased phagocytosis of fibrillar amyloid beta (Abeta) in microglia cells in vitro and in vivo. Generating APP/PS1-transgenic mice deficient for Mrp14, we observed a decrease of key cytokines involved in APP processing, a reduction of BACE1 expression and activity, and consequently overall Abeta deposition. We therefore conclude that Mrp14 promotes APP processing and Abeta accumulation under neuroinflammatory conditions.

23224319|t|Distinct patterns of APP processing in the CNS in autosomal-dominant and sporadic Alzheimer disease.
23224319|a|Autosomal-dominant Alzheimer disease (ADAD) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) or Presenilin (PSEN) genes. Studies from families with ADAD have been critical to support the amyloid cascade hypothesis of Alzheimer disease (AD), the basis for the current development of amyloid-based disease-modifying therapies in sporadic AD (SAD). However, whether the pathological changes in APP processing in the CNS in ADAD are similar to those observed in SAD remains unclear. In this study, we measured beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE) protein levels and activity, APP and APP C-terminal fragments in brain samples from subjects with ADAD carrying APP or PSEN1 mutations (n = 18), patients with SAD (n = 27) and age-matched controls (n = 22). We also measured sAPPbeta and BACE protein levels, as well as BACE activity, in CSF from individuals carrying PSEN1 mutations (10 mutation carriers and 7 non-carrier controls), patients with SAD (n = 32) and age-matched controls (n = 11). We found that in the brain, the pattern in ADAD was characterized by an increase in APP beta-C-terminal fragment (beta-CTF) levels despite no changes in BACE protein levels or activity. In contrast, the pattern in SAD in the brain was mainly characterized by an increase in BACE levels and activity, with less APP beta-CTF accumulation than ADAD. In the CSF, no differences were found between groups in BACE activity or expression or sAPPbeta levels. Taken together, these data suggest that the physiopathological events underlying the chronic Abeta production/clearance imbalance in SAD and ADAD are different. These differences should be considered in the design of intervention trials in AD.

23225334|t|beta-Amyloid in Lewy body disease is related to Alzheimer's disease-like atrophy.
23225334|a|The aim of this study was to investigate whether amyloid deposition is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like cortical atrophy in Lewy body (LB) disease (LBD). Participants included 15 LBD with dementia patients (8 with dementia with Lewy bodies [DLB] and 7 with Parkinson's disease [PD] with dementia [PDD]), 13 AD patients, and 17 healthy controls. Age, gender, and Mini-Mental State Examination scores were matched between patient groups. All subjects underwent PET scans with [(11)C]Pittsburgh Compound B to measure brain amyloid deposition as well as three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI. Gray-matter volumes (GMVs) were estimated by voxel-based morphometry. Volumes-of-interest analyses were also performed. Forty percent of the 15 DLB/PDD patients were amyloid positive, whereas all AD patients and none of the healthy controls were amyloid positive. Amyloid-positive DLB/PDD and AD patients showed very similar patterns of cortical atrophy in the parahippocampal area and lateral temporal and parietal cortices, with 95.2% of cortical atrophy distribution being overlapped. In contrast, amyloid-negative DLB/PDD patients had no significant cortical atrophy. Compared to healthy controls, parahippocampal GMVs were reduced by 26% in both the amyloid-positive DLB/PDD and AD groups and by 10% in the amyloid-negative DLB/PDD group. The results suggest that amyloid deposition is associated with AD-like atrophy in DLB/PDD patients. Early intervention against amyloid may prevent or delay AD-like atrophy in DLB/PDD patients with amyloid deposition.

23225543|t|Amyloid-beta oligomerization in Alzheimer dementia versus high-pathology controls.
23225543|a|OBJECTIVE: Although amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide deposition into insoluble plaques is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer disease; soluble oligomeric Abeta has been hypothesized to more directly underlie impaired learning and memory in dementia of the Alzheimer type. However, the lack of a sensitive, specific, and quantitative assay for Abeta oligomers has hampered rigorous tests of this hypothesis. METHODS: We developed a plate-based single molecule counting fluorescence immunoassay for oligomeric Abeta sensitive to low pg/ml concentrations of synthetic Abeta dimers using the same Abeta-specific monoclonal antibody to both capture and detect Abeta. The Abeta oligomer assay does not recognize monomeric Abeta, amyloid precursor protein, or other non-Abeta peptide oligomers. RESULTS: Abeta oligomers were detected in aqueous cortical lysates from patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type and nondemented patients with Abeta plaque pathology. However, Abeta oligomer concentrations in demented patients' lysates were tightly correlated with Abeta plaque coverage (r = 0.88), but this relationship was weaker in those from nondemented patients (r = 0.30) despite equivalent Abeta plaque pathology. The ratio of Abeta oligomer levels to plaque density fully distinguished demented from nondemented patients, with no overlap between groups in this derived variable. Other Abeta and plaque measures did not distinguish demented from nondemented patients. Abeta oligomers were not detected in cerebrospinal fluid with this assay. INTERPRETATION: The results raise the intriguing hypothesis that the linkage between plaques and oligomers may be a key pathophysiological event underlying dementia of the Alzheimer type. This Abeta oligomer assay may be useful for many tests of the oligomer hypothesis.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hourly measurements of plasma Abeta were compared between groups by age and amyloidosis. Plasma Abeta and CSF Abeta concentrations were compared for correlation, linear increase, and circadian patterns. RESULTS: Circadian patterns were observed in plasma Abeta, with diminished amplitudes with aging. Linear increase of Abeta was only observed for CSF Abeta in the YNC and Amyloid- groups, but not in the Amyloid+ group. No linear increase was observed for plasma Abeta. No significant correlations were found between plasma and CSF Abeta concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma Abeta, like CSF, demonstrates a circadian pattern that is reduced in amplitude with increasing age but is unaffected by amyloid deposition. However, we found no evidence that plasma and CSF Abeta concentrations were related on an hourly or individual basis.

23231807|t|Quercetin protects against the Abeta(25-35)-induced amnesic injury: involvement of inactivation of rage-mediated pathway and conservation of the NVU.
23231807|a|Quercetin has demonstrated protective effects against Abeta-induced toxicity on both neurons and endothelial cells. However, whether or not quercetin has an effect on the neurovascular coupling is unclear. In the present study, we aim to investigate the anti-amnesic effects of quercetin and to explore the underlying mechanisms. Abeta(25-35) (10 nmol) was administrated to mice i.c.v. Quercetin was administrated orally for 8 days after injection. Learning and memory behaviors were evaluated by measuring spontaneous alternation in Morris Water Maze test and the step-through positive avoidance test. The regional cerebral blood flow was monitored before the Abeta(25-35) injection and on seven consecutive days after injection. Mice were sacrificed and cerebral cortices were isolated on the last day. The effects of quercetin on the neurovascular unit (NVU) integrity, microvascular function and cholinergic neuronal changes, and the modification of signaling pathways were tested. Our results demonstrate that quercetin treatment for Abeta(25-35)-induced amnesic mice improved the learning and memory capabilities and conferred robust neurovascular coupling protection, involving maintenance of the NVU integrity, reduction of neurovascular oxidation, modulation of microvascular function, improvement of cholinergic system, and regulation of neurovascular RAGE signaling pathway and ERK/CREB/BDNF pathway. In conclusion, in Abeta(25-35)-induced amnesic mice, optimal doses of quercetin administration were beneficial. Quercetin protected the NVU likely through reduction of oxidative damage, inactivation of RAGE-mediated pathway and preservation of cholinergic neurons, offering an alternative medication for Alzheimer's disease.

23232269|t|Cerebrospinal fluid Abeta42 is the best predictor of clinical progression in patients with subjective complaints.
23232269|a|BACKGROUND: The need to recognize Alzheimer's disease (AD) as early as possible led us to evaluate the predictive value of amyloid beta(1-42) (Abeta42), total tau (tau), and phosphorylated tau (ptau) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for clinical progression in patients with subjective complaints. METHODS: We recruited nondemented patients with subjective complaints (i.e., criteria for mild cognitive impairment [MCI] not fulfilled) from our memory clinic. We assessed the predictive value of CSF Abeta42, tau, and ptau for clinical progression using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, gender, and baseline findings on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Clinical progression was defined as progression to MCI or AD. RESULTS: We included 127 patients with subjective complaints (age 60 +- 10 years, 61 [48%] females, MMSE 29 +- 1). At baseline, Abeta42 and tau were abnormal in 20 patients (both 16%), and ptau in 32 patients (25%). Thirteen patients (10%) progressed to MCI (n = 11) or AD (n = 2). Abeta42 was the strongest predictor of progression to MCI or AD with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 16.0 (3.8-66.4). The adjusted HR associated with tau was 2.8 (0.9-9.2) and with ptau 2.6 (0.8-8.2). Combinations of biomarkers had a lower predictive value than Abeta42 alone. CONCLUSION: Low Abeta42 was the strongest predictor of clinical progression in patients with subjective complaints. These results are in line with the hypothesis that the cascade of pathologic events starts with deposition of Abeta42, whereas neuronal degeneration and hyperphosphorylation of tau are more downstream events, closer to clinical manifestation of AD.

23238734|t|Loss of PAFAH1B2 reduces amyloid-beta generation by promoting the degradation of amyloid precursor protein C-terminal fragments.
23238734|a|Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is believed to play a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. In view of the side effects associated with inhibiting the secretases that produce Abeta, new molecular targets are required to provide alternative therapeutic options. We used RNA interference (RNAi) to systematically screen the Drosophila genome to identify genes that modulate Abeta production upon knockdown. RNAi of 41 genes in Drosophila cells significantly lowered Abeta without affecting general secretion or viability. After the gamma-secretase complex components, the most potent effect was observed for platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase alpha (Paf-AHalpha), and, in mammalian cells, the effect was replicated for its ortholog PAFAH1B2. Knockdown of PAFAH1B2 strongly reduced Abeta secretion from human cells, and this effect was confirmed in primary cells derived from PAFAH1B2 knock-out mice. Reduced Abeta production was not attributable to altered beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) ectodomain shedding but was a result of an enhanced degradation of APP C-terminal fragments (CTFs) in the absence of PAFAH1B2 but not its close homolog PAFAH1B3. Enhanced degradation of APP CTFs was selective because no such effects were obtained for Notch or E-/N-cadherin. Thus, we have identified an important protein that can selectively modify Abeta generation via a novel mechanism, namely enhanced degradation of its immediate precursor. In view of the absence of a neurological phenotype in PAFAH1B2 knock-out mice, targeted downregulation of PAFAH1B2 may be a promising new strategy for lowering Abeta.

23242790|t|Hippocampal neurofibromin and amyloid precursor protein expression in dopamine D3 receptor knock-out mice following passive avoidance conditioning.
23242790|a|Passive avoidance (PA) conditioning is a fear motivated task able to initiate a cascade of altered gene expression within the hippocampus, a structure critical to learning and memory. We have previously shown that neurofibromin (NF1) and amyloid precursor protein (APP), two genes implicated in cognitive function, are differentially expressed in brain of dopamine D3 receptor knock-out mice (D(3)R(-/-)), suggesting that the receptor might have a role in their trascriptional regulation. Here in this study, we hypothesized that during acquisition of PA conditioning the expression of NF1 and APP genes could be influenced by D(3)Rs. To address this issue, we analyzed the expression of NF1 and APP in the hippocampus of both wild-type (WT) and D(3)R(-/-) mice subjected to the single trial step-through PA paradigm. Our finding demonstrated that (1) D(3)R(-/-) mice exhibit increased cognitive performance as compared to WT mice in the step-through PA trial; (2) acquisition of PA increased D(3)R and NF1, but not APP expression in WT mice hippocampus; (3) PA-driven NF1 induction in WT was abrogated in D(3)R(-/-) mice and finally that (4) the heightened basal APP expression observed in naive D(3)R(-/-) mice was totally reversed by acquisition of PA. In conclusion, the present finding show for the first time that both D(3)R and NF1 genes are upregulated following PA conditioning and suggest that hippocampal D(3)Rs might be relevant to NF1 transcriptional regulation in the hippocampus.

23243071|t|Amyloid is linked to cognitive decline in patients with Parkinson disease without dementia.
23243071|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine whether amyloid burden, as indexed by Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) retention, identifies patients with Parkinson disease with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) compared to those with normal cognition (PD-nl). A related aim is to determine whether amyloid burden predicts cognitive decline in a cohort of subjects with PD without dementia. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we examined 46 subjects with PD without dementia, of whom 35 had normal cognition and 11 met criteria for PD-MCI at study baseline. All subjects underwent standardized neurologic and neuropsychological examinations and PiB PET at baseline, and clinical examinations were conducted annually for up to 5 years. RESULTS: At baseline, precuneus PiB retention did not distinguish PD-MCI from PD-nl. Subjects with PD-MCI declined more rapidly than PD-nl subjects on cognitive tests of memory, executive function, and activation retrieval. Of the 35 PD-nl subjects, 8 progressed to PD-MCI and 1 to dementia; of the 11 PD-MCI subjects, 5 converted to dementia. Both higher PiB retention and a diagnosis of PD-MCI predicted a greater hazard of conversion to a more severe diagnosis. Baseline PiB retention predicted worsening in executive function over time. The APOE epsilon4 allele also related to worsening in executive function, as well as visuospatial function, activation retrieval, and performance on the Mini-Mental State Examination. In contrast to its relation to cognitive decline, PiB retention did not affect progression of motor impairment. CONCLUSIONS: At baseline measurements, amyloid burden does not distinguish between cognitively impaired and unimpaired subjects with PD without dementia, but our data suggest that amyloid contributes to cognitive, but not motor, decline over time.

23245294|t|Cortical beta amyloid protein triggers an immune response, but no synaptic changes in the APPswe/PS1dE9 Alzheimer's disease mouse model.
23245294|a|Using microarray technology we studied the genome-wide gene expression profiles in the frontal cortex of APPswe/PS1dE9 mice and age and sex-matched littermates at the age of 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15-18 months to investigate transcriptional changes that are associated with beta amyloid protein (Abeta) plaque formation and buildup. We observed the occurrence of an immune response with glial activation, but no changes in genes involved in synaptic transmission or plasticity. Comparison of the mouse gene expression data set with a human data set representing the course of Alzheimer's disease revealed a strikingly limited overlap between gene expression in the APPswe/PS1dE9 and human Alzheimer's disease prefrontal cortex. Only plexin domain containing 2, complement component 4b, and solute carrier family 14 (urea transporter) member 1 were significantly upregulated in the mouse and human brain which might suggest a function in Abeta pathology for these 3 genes. In both data sets we detected clusters of upregulated genes involved in immune-related processes. We conclude that the APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse can be a good model to study the immune response associated with cortical Abeta plaques.

23250109|t|In vivo detection of cerebral cortical microinfarcts with high-resolution 7T MRI.
23250109|a|Cerebrovascular disease has an important role in cognitive decline and dementia. In this context, cerebral microinfarcts are attracting increasing attention, but these lesions could thus far not be detected in vivo. The aim of this study was to try to identify possible cortical microinfarcts on high-resolution 7T in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to perform a histopathologic validation study on similar appearing lesions on 7T ex vivo MRI of postmortem brain tissue. The study population consisted of 22 elderly subjects, who underwent 7T MRI. The fluid attenuated inversion recovery, T(2), and T(1) weighted scans of these subjects were examined for possible cortical microinfarcts. In the ex vivo MRI study, 15 formalin-fixed coronal brain slices of 6 subjects with Alzheimer and vascular pathology were examined and subjected to histopathologic verification. On the in vivo scans, 15 cortical lesions could be identified that were likely to be microinfarcts in 6 subjects. In the postmortem tissue, 6 similar appearing lesions were identified of which 5 were verified as cortical microinfarcts on histopathology. This study provides strong evidence that cortical microinfarcts can be detected in vivo, which will be of great value in further studies into the role of vascular disease in cognitive decline and dementia.

23253046|t|Amelioration of Alzheimer's disease by neuroprotective effect of sulforaphane in animal model.
23253046|a|Pathophysiological evidences of AD have indicated that aggregation of Abeta is one of the principal causes of neuronal dysfunction, largely by way of inducing oxidative stresses such as free radical formation. We hypothesized that the known antioxidative attribute of SFN could be harnessed in Alzheimer's treatment. SFN is an indirect, potent antioxidant derived from broccoli that has previously been found to stimulate the Nrf2-ARE pathway and facilitate several other cytoprotective mechanisms. In this study, administration of SFN ameliorated cognitive function of Abeta-induced AD acute mouse models in Y-maze and passive avoidance behavior tests. Interestingly, we found that the therapeutic effect of SFN did not involve inhibition of Abeta aggregation. While the exact mechanism of interaction of SFN in AD has not yet been ascertained, our results suggest that SFN can aid in cognitive impairment and may protect the brain from amyloidogenic damages.

23255822|t|Differential effect of APOE genotype on amyloid load and glucose metabolism in AD dementia.
23255822|a|OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationships between apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 dose and in vivo distributions of both fibrillary amyloid burden and glucose metabolism in the same Alzheimer disease dementia patients, selected for abnormal amyloid imaging. METHODS: Twenty-two APOE epsilon4 negative, 40 heterozygous, and 22 homozygous Alzheimer disease dementia patients underwent dynamic (90 minutes) [(11)C]Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) and static [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET scans. Parametric nondisplaceable binding potential images of [(11)C]PIB and standardized uptake value ratio images of [(18)F]FDG were generated using cerebellar gray matter as reference tissue. Frontal, parietal, temporal, posterior cingulate, and occipital cortices were selected as regions of interest. RESULTS: Multivariate general linear models with adjustment for age, sex, and Mini-Mental State Examination showed main effects of APOE epsilon4 dose on distributions of both [(11)C]PIB (p for trend <0.05) and [(18)F]FDG (p for trend <0.01). More specifically, a univariate general linear model of individual regions showed increased [(11)C]PIB binding in frontal cortex of APOE epsilon4 noncarriers compared with APOE epsilon4 carriers (p < 0.05). In contrast, APOE epsilon4 carriers had reduced [(18)F]FDG uptake in occipital cortex (p < 0.05) and a borderline significant effect in posterior cingulate (p = 0.07) in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: We found a reversed APOE epsilon4 dose effect for amyloid deposition in the frontal lobe, whereas APOE epsilon4 carriership was associated with more profound metabolic impairment in posterior parts of the cortex. These findings suggest that APOE genotype has a differential effect on the distribution of amyloid plaques and glucose metabolism. This may have important implications for emerging therapies that aim to directly intervene in the disease process.

23257508|t|Carnosic acid suppresses the production of amyloid-beta 1-42 by inducing the metalloprotease gene TACE/ADAM17 in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells.
23257508|a|A hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the aggressive appearance of plaques of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides, which result from the sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the beta- and gamma-secretases. Abeta production is evaded by alternate cleavage of APP by the alpha- and gamma-secretases. Carnosic acid (CA) has been proven to activate the transcription factor Nrf2, a main regulator of the antioxidant response. We investigated the effects of CA on the production of Abeta 1-42 peptide (Abeta42) and on the expressions of the related genes in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. The treatment of cells with CA suppressed Abeta42 secretion (61% suppression at 30muM). CA treatment enhanced the mRNA expressions of an alpha-secretase TACE (tumor necrosis factor-alpha-converting enzyme, also called a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17, ADAM17) significantly and another alpha-secretase ADAM10 marginally; however, the beta-secretase BACE1 (beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme-1) was not increased by CA. Knockdown of TACE by siRNA reduced soluble-APPalpha secretion enhanced by CA and partially recovered the CA-suppressed Abeta42 secretion. These results suggest that CA reduces Abeta42 production by activating TACE without promoting BACE1 in human neuroblastoma cells. The use of CA may have a potential in the prevention of Abeta-mediated diseases, particularly AD.

23261462|t|Formation of non-toxic Abeta fibrils by small heat shock protein under heat-stress conditions.
23261462|a|Small heat shock protein (sHsp) is a molecular chaperone with a conserved alpha-crystallin domain that can prevent protein aggregation. It has been shown that sHsps exist as oligomers (12-40 mer) and their dissociation into small dimers or oligomers is functionally important. Since several sHsps are upregulated and co-localized with amyloid-beta (Abeta) in senile plaques of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), sHsps are thought to be involved in AD. Previous studies have also shown that sHsp can prevent Abeta aggregation in vitro. However, it remains unclear how the quaternary structure of sHsp influences Abeta aggregation. In this study, we report for the first time the effect of the quaternary structure of sHsp on Abeta aggregation using sHsp from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (SpHsp16.0) showing a clear temperature-dependent structural transition between an oligomer (30  C) and dimer (50  C) state. Abeta aggregation was inhibited by the oligomeric form of SpHsp16.0. In contrast, amyloid fibrils were formed in the presence of dimeric SpHsp16.0. Interestingly, these amyloid fibrils consisted of both Abeta and SpHsp16.0 and showed a low ThT intensity and low cytotoxicity due to their low binding affinity to the cell surface. These results suggest the formation of novel fibrillar Abeta amyloid with different characteristics from that of the authentic Abeta amyloid fibrils formed in the absence of sHsp. Our results also suggest the potential protective role of sHsp in AD under stress conditions.

23261769|t|Abundant pyroglutamate-modified ABri and ADan peptides in extracellular and vascular amyloid deposits in familial British and Danish dementias.
23261769|a|Familial British and familial Danish dementia (FDD) are progressive neurodegenerative disorders characterized by cerebral deposition of the amyloidogenic peptides ABri and ADan, respectively. These amyloid peptides start with an N-terminal glutamate residue, which can be posttranslationally converted into a pyroglutamate (pGlu) modified form, a mechanism which has been extensively described to be relevant for amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides in Alzheimer's disease. Like pGlu-Abeta peptides, pGlu-ABri peptides have an increased aggregation propensity and show higher toxicity on human neuroblastoma cells as their nonmodified counterparts. We have generated novel N-terminal specific antibodies detecting the pGlu-modified forms of ABri and ADan peptides. With these antibodies we were able to identify abundant extracellular amyloid plaques, vascular, and parenchymal deposits in human familial British dementia and FDD brain tissue, and in a mouse model for FDD. Double-stainings using C-terminal specific antibodies in human samples revealed that highly aggregated pGlu-ABri and pGlu-ADan peptides are mainly present in plaque cores and central vascular deposits, leading to the assumption that these peptides have seeding properties. Furthermore, in an FDD-mouse model ADan peptides were detected in presynaptic terminals of the hippocampus where they might contribute to impaired synaptic transmission. These similarities of ABri and ADan to Abeta in Alzheimer's disease suggest that the posttranslational pGlu-modification of amyloid peptides might represent a general pathological mechanism leading to increased aggregation and toxicity in these forms of degenerative dementias.

23262221|t|Breaking the amyloidogenicity code: methods to predict amyloids from amino acid sequence.
23262221|a|Numerous studies have shown that the ability to form amyloid fibrils is an inherent property of the polypeptide chain. This has lead to the development of several computational approaches to predict amyloidogenicity by amino acid sequences. Here, we discuss the principles governing these methods, and evaluate them using several datasets. They deliver excellent performance in the tests made using short peptides (~6 residues). However, there is a general tendency towards a high number of false positives when tested against longer sequences. This shortcoming needs to be addressed as these longer sequences are linked to diseases. Recent structural studies have shown that the core element of the majority of disease-related amyloid fibrils is a beta-strand-loop-beta-strand motif called beta-arch. This insight provides an opportunity to substantially improve the prediction of amyloids produced by natural proteins, ushering in an era of personalized medicine based on genome analysis.

23262662|t|A simple method of labeling amyloid beta with quantum dots and ingestion of the labeled amyloid beta by astrocytes.
23262662|a|Steady labeling of amyloid beta (Abeta) is crucial for studying the ingestion and degradation of Abeta by astrocytes and unraveling a relevant regulation mechanism. Quantum dots (QDs) are an optimum labeling reagent for this because of their strong and steady fluorescence properties. In this paper, Abeta was labeled with QDs by a simple mixed incubation strategy, with a QD labeled Abeta complex (QDs-Abeta) being obtained. In the complex, QDs efficiently restrained the formation of beta-folding and fibrils of Abeta, while the graininess, dispersivity and fluorescence properties of the QDs hardly changed. The fluorescence microscopy imaging results showed that the astrocytes could ingest the QDs-Abeta. The QDs and Abeta did not separate from each other during the ingestion process, and the Abeta could be degraded subsequently.

23266004|t|Research and standardization in Alzheimer's trials: reaching international consensus.
23266004|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an epidemic facing the entire world. Increased knowledge gained during the past 25 years indicates that AD falls along a clinical and neuropathological spectrum represented as a continuum that extends from preclinical disease in which there are no symptoms, through early symptomatic phases, and finally to AD dementia. The Alzheimer's research community recognizes that imaging, body fluids, and cognitive biomarkers contribute to enhanced diagnostic confidence for AD. There has also been emerging consensus regarding the use of AD biomarkers in clinical trials. The use of biomarkers in clinical trials and practice is hampered by the lack of standardization. In response to the emerging need for standardization, an international meeting of AD researchers was held in Melbourne, Australia, in March 2012 to bring together key researchers, clinicians, industry, and regulatory stakeholders with the aim of generating consensus on standardization and validation of cognitive, imaging, and fluid biomarkers, as well as lifestyle parameters used in research centers worldwide.

23267112|t|Aliphatic peptides show similar self-assembly to amyloid core sequences, challenging the importance of aromatic interactions in amyloidosis.
23267112|a|The self-assembly of abnormally folded proteins into amyloid fibrils is a hallmark of many debilitating diseases, from Alzheimer's and Parkinson diseases to prion-related disorders and diabetes type II. However, the fundamental mechanism of amyloid aggregation remains poorly understood. Core sequences of four to seven amino acids within natural amyloid proteins that form toxic fibrils have been used to study amyloidogenesis. We recently reported a class of systematically designed ultrasmall peptides that self-assemble in water into cross-beta-type fibers. Here we compare the self-assembly of these peptides with natural core sequences. These include core segments from Alzheimer's amyloid-beta, human amylin, and calcitonin. We analyzed the self-assembly process using circular dichroism, electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, rheology, and molecular dynamics simulations. We found that the designed aliphatic peptides exhibited a similar self-assembly mechanism to several natural sequences, with formation of alpha-helical intermediates being a common feature. Interestingly, the self-assembly of a second core sequence from amyloid-beta, containing the diphenylalanine motif, was distinctly different from all other examined sequences. The diphenylalanine-containing sequence formed beta-sheet aggregates without going through the alpha-helical intermediate step, giving a unique fiber-diffraction pattern and simulation structure. Based on these results, we propose a simplified aliphatic model system to study amyloidosis. Our results provide vital insight into the nature of early intermediates formed and suggest that aromatic interactions are not as important in amyloid formation as previously postulated. This information is necessary for developing therapeutic drugs that inhibit and control amyloid formation.

23267843|t|Extracellular matrix modulator lysyl oxidase colocalizes with amyloid-beta pathology in Alzheimer's disease and hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis--Dutch type.
23267843|a|Accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in brain vessel walls and parenchyma, known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and senile plaques (SPs), respectively, plays a key role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis of the Dutch type (HCHWA-D) pathogenesis. Although the mechanisms underlying CAA and SP formation remain largely unknown, evidence is mounting that local alterations of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the brain vessel wall and/or parenchyma play an important role. Lysyl oxidase (LOX, E.C. 1.4.3.13) is an inducible amine oxidase that modulates the ECM by catalyzing the formation of molecular covalent cross-links in ECM proteins. The aim of this study is to investigate the association of LOX with CAA and with classic and diffuse SPs in both AD and HCHWA-D cases. We observed an association of LOX with Abeta in CAA and with Abeta in both classic and diffuse SPs in AD and HCHWA-D cases. In addition, LOX staining was observed in reactive astrocytes associated with these lesions. We conclude that the ECM modulating enzyme LOX is associated with the Abeta-related pathological hallmarks of both AD and HCHWA-D, and that our findings provide additional insights into the mechanisms underlying the formation of these lesions.

23269484|t|Statins reduce amyloid beta-peptide production by modulating amyloid precursor protein maturation and phosphorylation through a cholesterol-independent mechanism in cultured neurons.
23269484|a|Statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, have been reported to attenuate amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) production in various cellular models. However, the mechanisms by which statins affect neuronal Abeta production have not yet been clarified. Here, we investigated this issue in rat primary cortical neurons using two statins, pitavastatin (PV) and atorvastatin (AV). Treatment of neurons with 0.2-2.5 muM PV or AV for 4 days induced a concentration- and time-dependent reduction in the secretion of both Abeta40 and Abeta42. Moreover, Western blot analyses of cell lysates showed that treatment with PV or AV significantly reduced expression levels of the mature form of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Thr668-phosphorylated APP (P-APP), but not immature form of APP; the decreases in P-APP levels were more notable than those of mature APP levels. The statin treatment did not alter expression of BACE1 (beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1) or gamma-secretase complex proteins (presenilin 1, nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2). In neurons overexpressing APP via recombinant adenoviruses, PV or AV similarly reduced Abeta secretion and the levels of mature APP and P-APP. Statins also markedly reduced cellular cholesterol content in neurons in a concentration-dependent manner. Co-treatment with mevalonate reversed the statin-induced decreases in Abeta secretion and mature APP and P-APP levels, whereas co-treatment with cholesterol did not, despite recovery of cellular cholesterol levels. Finally, cell-surface biotinylation experiments revealed that both statins significantly reduced the levels of cell-surface P-APP without changing those of cell surface mature APP. These results suggest that statins reduce Abeta production by selectively modulating APP maturation and phosphorylation through a mechanism independent of cholesterol reduction in cultured neurons.

23273599|t|Cortical atrophy and hypoperfusion in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
23273599|a|Magnetic resonance imaging studies have revealed distinct patterns of cortical atrophy and hypoperfusion in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The relationship between these in vivo imaging measures and the corresponding underlying pathophysiological changes, however, remains elusive. Recently, attention has turned to neuroimaging of mouse models of Alzheimer's disease in which imaging-pathological correlations can be readily performed. In this study, anatomical and arterial spin labeling perfusion magnetic resonance imaging scans of amyloid precursor protein transgenic and age-matched wild-type mice were acquired at 3, 12, and 18 months of age. Fully-automated image processing methods were used to derive quantitative measures of cortical thickness and perfusion. These studies revealed increased regional cortical thickness in young transgenic mice relative to age-matched wild-type mice. However, the transgenic mice generally demonstrated a greater rate of cortical thinning over 15 months. Cortical perfusion was significantly reduced in young transgenic mice in comparison with wild-type mice across most brain regions. Previously unreported regional genotype differences and age-related changes in cortical thickness and cerebral perfusion were identified in amyloid precursor protein transgenic and wild-type mice.

23274154|t|Global standardization measurement of cerebral spinal fluid for Alzheimer's disease: an update from the Alzheimer's Association Global Biomarkers Consortium.
23274154|a|Recognizing that international collaboration is critical for the acceleration of biomarker standardization efforts and the efficient development of improved diagnosis and therapy, the Alzheimer's Association created the Global Biomarkers Standardization Consortium (GBSC) in 2010. The consortium brings together representatives of academic centers, industry, and the regulatory community with the common goal of developing internationally accepted common reference standards and reference methods for the assessment of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid beta42 (Abeta42) and tau biomarkers. Such standards are essential to ensure that analytical measurements are reproducible and consistent across multiple laboratories and across multiple kit manufacturers. Analytical harmonization for CSF Abeta42 and tau will help reduce confusion in the AD community regarding the absolute values associated with the clinical interpretation of CSF biomarker results and enable worldwide comparison of CSF biomarker results across AD clinical studies.

23274703|t|Protective effect of cyanidin 3-O-glucoside on beta-amyloid peptide-induced cognitive impairment in rats.
23274703|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that results in cognitive impairment. It has been proposed that deposits of beta-amyloid (Abeta) form the cores of the plaque and, subsequently, induce the activation of GSK-3beta and the hyperphosphorylation of tau, resulting in cognitive impairment. Oxidative stress has been proposed to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of AD. Cyanidin 3-O-glucoside (Cy3G) is a neuroprotective antioxidant. However, the effects of Cy3G on cognition are unclear. In this paper, we show that Cy3G is protective against the Abeta-induced impairment of learning and memory, but has no effect on normal learning and memory. Moreover, we found that Gy3G attenuated the Abeta-induced tau hyperphosphorylation and GSK-3beta hyperactivation observed in AD. Taken together, these results demonstrated that Cy3G can rescue the cognitive impairments that are induced by Abeta via the modulation of GSK-3beta/tau, suggesting a potential therapeutic role of Cy3G in AD.

23274884|t|Leptin regulates amyloid beta production via the gamma-secretase complex.
23274884|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common age-related neurodegenerative disease, affecting an estimated 5.3million people in the United States. While many factors likely contribute to AD progression, it is widely accepted that AD is driven by the accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta), a small, fibrillogenic peptide generated by the sequential proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein by the beta- and gamma-secretases. Though the underlying causes of Abeta accumulation in sporadic AD are myriad, it is clear that lifestyle and overall health play a significant role. The adipocyte-derived hormone leptin has varied systemic affects, including neuropeptide release and neuroprotection. A recent study by Lieb et al. (2009) showed that individuals with low plasma leptin levels are at greater risk of developing AD, through unknown mechanisms. In this report, we show that plasma leptin is a strong negative predictor of Abeta levels in the mouse brain, supporting a protective role for the hormone in AD onset. We also show that the inhibition of Abeta accumulation is due to the downregulation of transcription of the gamma-secretase components. On the other hand, beta-secretase expression is either unchanged (BACE1) or increased (BACE2). Finally, we show that only presenilin 1 (PS1) is negatively correlated with plasma leptin at the protein level (p<0.0001). These data are intriguing and may highlight a role for leptin in regulating the onset of amyloid pathology and AD.

23276384|t|A ketone ester diet exhibits anxiolytic and cognition-sparing properties, and lessens amyloid and tau pathologies in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
23276384|a|Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves progressive accumulation of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) and neurofibrillary pathologies, and glucose hypometabolism in brain regions critical for memory. The 3xTgAD mouse model was used to test the hypothesis that a ketone ester-based diet can ameliorate AD pathogenesis. Beginning at a presymptomatic age, 2 groups of male 3xTgAD mice were fed a diet containing a physiological enantiomeric precursor of ketone bodies (KET) or an isocaloric carbohydrate diet. The results of behavioral tests performed at 4 and 7 months after diet initiation revealed that KET-fed mice exhibited significantly less anxiety in 2 different tests. 3xTgAD mice on the KET diet also exhibited significant, albeit relatively subtle, improvements in performance on learning and memory tests. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that KET-fed mice exhibited decreased Abeta deposition in the subiculum, CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus, and the amygdala. KET-fed mice exhibited reduced levels of hyperphosphorylated tau deposition in the same regions of the hippocampus, amygdala, and cortex. Thus, a novel ketone ester can ameliorate proteopathic and behavioral deficits in a mouse AD model.

23276665|t|Characterization of cognitive deficits in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and effects of donepezil and memantine.
23276665|a|Alzheimer's disease is characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive function and involves beta-amyloid (Abeta) in its pathogenesis. To characterize cognitive deficits associated with Abeta accumulation, we analyzed PS1/APP mice overexpressing mutant presenilin-1 (PS1, M146L; line 6.2) and amyloid precursor protein (APP, K670N/M671L; line Tg2576), a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease with accelerated Abeta production. Age-dependent changes in working and spatial memory behaviors were investigated using Y-maze and Morris water maze tasks, respectively, in female PS1/APP mice at ages of 2, 4, 6, and 12 months. Significant deficits in working and spatial memory were observed from 4 and 6 months of age, respectively. Acute single-dose administrations of memantine, a low-to-moderate-affinity N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, showed improvements in working memory deficits at 4 months of age, whereas donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor, did not. However, both drugs improved spatial memory dysfunction at 6 months of age at therapeutically relevant doses. No age-related dramatic changes were observed in expression levels of several proteins relating to memory dysfunction and also the mechanisms of donepezil and memantine in the cerebral cortex of PS1/APP mice until 6 months of age. Taken together, these results suggest dysfunctions in cholinergic and/or glutamatergic transmissions may be involved in the cognitive deficits associated with Abeta toxicity. Since donepezil and memantine have been widely used for treating patients of Alzheimer's disease, these results also suggest that cognitive deficits in PS1/APP mice assessed in the Y-maze and Morris water maze tasks are a useful animal model for evaluating novel Alzheimer's disease therapeutics.

23276885|t|Heterogeneity of elderly depression: increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and Abeta protein metabolism.
23276885|a|Epidemiological studies have proposed that depression may increase the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), even in patients with early-onset depression. Although metabolism of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) in elderly depression received attention in terms of their correlation, there is a serious heterogeneity in elderly depression in terms of age at onset of depression. Moreover, it is unknown whether early-onset major depressive disorder (MDD) has a long-term effect on the involvement of Abeta metabolism and later development of AD. Thus, we evaluated serum Abeta40 and Abeta42 levels, the Abeta40/Abeta42 ratio in 89 elderly (>=60 years of age) inpatients with MDD and 81 age-matched healthy controls, and compared them among patients with early-onset (<60 years) and late-onset (>=60years) MDD and controls. The results showed that the serum Abeta40/Abeta42 ratio was significantly higher in patients with both early- and late-onset MDD than in controls (early-onset, p=0.010; late-onset, p=0.043), and it is of great interest that the serum Abeta40/Abeta42 ratio was negatively correlated with the age at MDD onset (R=-0.201, p=0.032). These results suggest that an earlier onset of MDD may have a more serious abnormality in Abeta metabolism, possibly explaining a biological mechanism underlying the link between depression and AD.

23280791|t|Effect of lifestyle activities on Alzheimer disease biomarkers and cognition.
23280791|a|OBJECTIVE: A study was undertaken to investigate the association of intellectual and physical activity with biomarkers of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathophysiology and cognition in a nondemented elderly population. The biomarkers evaluated were brain Abeta load via Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-positron emission tomography (PET), neuronal dysfunction via (18) F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET, and neurodegeneration via structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: We studied 515 nondemented (428 cognitively normal and 87 mild cognitive impairment) participants in the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging who completed a 3T MRI, PET scans, and APOE genotype, and had lifestyle activity measures and cognition data available. The imaging measures computed were global PiB-PET uptake, and global FDG-PET and MRI based hippocampal volume. We consolidated activity variables into lifetime intellectual, current intellectual, and current physical activities. We used a global cognitive z score as a measure of cognition. We applied 2 independent methods-partial correlation analysis adjusted for age and gender and path analysis using structural equations-to evaluate the associations between lifestyle activities, imaging biomarkers, and global cognition. RESULTS: None of the lifestyle variables were correlated with the biomarkers, and the path associations between lifestyle variables and biomarkers were not significant (p > 0.05). Conversely, all the biomarkers were correlated with global cognitive z score (p < 0.05), and the path associations between (lifetime and current) intellectual activities and global z score were significant (p < 0.01). INTERPRETATION: Intellectual and physical activity lifestyle factors were not associated with AD biomarkers, but intellectual lifestyle factors explained variability in the cognitive performance in this nondemented population. This study provides evidence that lifestyle activities may delay the onset of dementia but do not significantly influence the expression of AD pathophysiology.

23286052|t|MR-less surface-based amyloid estimation by subject-specific atlas selection and Bayesian fusion.
23286052|a|For clinical evaluation, assessing amyloid deposition with PiB-PET is desirable without requiring MR acquisition and associated fusion/segmentation techniques. A useful clinical tool is to estimate PiB-PET against the brain surface, which is however challenging using PET alone because of the lack of structural information. We propose a method to generate such estimate, where multiple atlases are selected and combined with local weights in a Bayesian framework. Qualitative and quantitative comparison with and without MRI are presented. Using PET only, the average error on the brain surface was around 13% compared to MRI-dependant method.

23300381|t|Functional amyloidogenesis and cytotoxicity-insights into biology and pathology.
23300381|a|Prions are self-templating protein structures that can be transferred from organism to organism. The [Het-s] prion propagates as a functional amyloid aggregate in the filamentous fungi Podospora anserina, and is involved in mediating heterokaryon incompatibility. Fusion of a P. anserina strain harboring the [Het-s] prion with another strain expressing the soluble Het-S protein results in cell death. The mechanism of Het-s/Het-S-mediated cell death has now been revealed in a paper just published in PLOS Biology. The study shows that Het-s and Het-S C-terminal domain co-amyloidogenesis induces a profound conformational rearrangement in the N-terminal Het-S HeLo domain, resulting in the exposure of a nascent transmembrane helix. Oligomerization of these helices leads to pore formation, leakage of the cytosolic contents, and subsequent cell death. Thus, Het-s amyloid plays a major role in the life cycle of P. anserina by orchestrating a complex conformational change in the Het-S protein, resulting in cytotoxicity by compromising membrane integrity. This ability of Het-s functional amyloid to initiate programmed cytotoxicity by mediating a conformational change in another protein significantly expands the functional repertoire of amyloid. Moreover, the mechanism of Het-S cell killing may be similar to the mechanism by which some pathological amyloid proteins lead to the demise of post-mitotic tissue.

23303044|t|Increased amyloid-beta peptide-induced memory deficits in phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) gene knockout mice.
23303044|a|Oxidative stress is recognized as one of the earliest and most intense pathological processes in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the antioxidant vitamin E has been shown to efficiently prevent amyloid plaque formation and neurodegeneration. Plasma phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) has a major role in vitamin E transfers in vivo, and PLTP deficiency in mice is associated with reduced brain vitamin E levels. To determine the impact of PLTP on amyloid pathology in vivo, we analyzed the vulnerability of PLTP-deficient (PLTP-KO) mice to the toxic effects induced by intracerebroventricular injection of oligomeric amyloid-beta 25-35 (Abeta 25-35) peptide, a non-transgenic model of AD. Under basal conditions, PLTP-KO mice showed increased cerebral oxidative stress, increased brain Abeta 1-42 levels, and a lower expression of the synaptic function marker synaptophysin, as compared with wild-type mice. This PLTP-KO phenotype was associated with increased memory impairment 1 week after Abeta25-35 peptide injection. Restoration of brain vitamin E levels in PLTP-KO mice through a chronic dietary supplementation prevented Abeta 25-35-induced memory deficits and reduced cerebral oxidative stress and toxicity. We conclude that PLTP, through its ability to deliver vitamin E to the brain, constitutes an endogenous neuroprotective agent. Increasing PLTP activity may offer a new way to develop neuroprotective therapies.

23316126|t|Mechanisms for the Insertion of Toxic, Fibril-like beta-Amyloid Oligomers into the Membrane.
23316126|a|Amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers destabilize cellular ionic homeostasis, mediating Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is still unclear whether the mechanism (i) is mediated by cell surface receptors; (ii) is direct, with Abeta oligomers interacting with membrane lipids; or (iii) both mechanisms take place. Recent studies indicate that Abeta oligomers may act by either of the last two. Little is known about the oligomers' structures and how they spontaneously insert into the membrane. Using explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we show that fibril-like Abeta(17-42) (p3) oligomer is capable of penetrating the membrane. Insertion is similar to that observed for protegrin-1 (PG-1), a cytolytic beta-sheet-rich antimicrobial peptide (AMP). Both Abeta and PG-1 favor the amphipathic interface of the lipid bilayer in the early stage of interaction with the membrane. U-shaped Abeta oligomers are observed in solution and in the membrane, suggesting that the preformed seeds can be shared by amyloid fibrils in the growth phase and membrane toxicity. Here we provide sequential events in possible Abeta oligomer membrane-insertion pathways. We speculate that for the U-shaped motif, a trimer is the minimal oligomer size to insert effectively. We propose that monomers and dimers may insert in (apparently on-pathway) aggregation-intermediate beta-hairpin state, and may (or may not) convert to a U-shape in the bilayer. Together with earlier observations, our results point to a non-specific, broadly heterogeneous landscape of membrane-inserting oligomer conformations, pathways, and membrane-mediated toxicity of beta-rich oligomers.

23353734|t|Synthesis and evaluation of oxime derivatives as modulators for amyloid beta-induced mitochondrial dysfunction.
23353734|a|Starting from quinuclidinyl oxime 1 identified by preliminary screening, a series of azacycles-containing oxime derivatives was synthesized. Their mPTP blocking activities were evaluated by a JC-1 assay, measuring the change of mitochondrial membrane potential. The inhibitory activity of nine compounds against amyloid beta-induced mPTP opening was comparable or even superior to that of piracetam. Among them, 12d effectively maintained mitochondrial function and cell viabilities on the ATP assay, the MTT assay, and the ROS assay. In addition, it exhibited favorable in vitro stability and pharmacokinetic characteristics, which hold a promise for further development of AD therapeutics.

23443094|t|Cholesterol-dependent energy transfer between fluorescent proteins-insights into protein proximity of APP and BACE1 in different membranes in Niemann-Pick type C disease cells.
23443094|a|Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) -based techniques have recently been applied to study the interactions between beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme-GFP (BACE1-GFP) and amyloid precursor protein-mRFP (APP-mRFP) in U373 glioblastoma cells. In this context, the role of APP-BACE1 proximity in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis has been discussed. FRET was found to depend on intracellular cholesterol levels and associated alterations in membrane stiffness. Here, NPC1 null cells (CHO-NPC1-/-), exhibiting increased cholesterol levels and disturbed cholesterol transport similar to that observed in Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC), were used to analyze the influence of altered cholesterol levels on APP-BACE1 proximity. Fluorescence lifetime measurements of whole CHO-wild type (WT) and CHO-NPC1-/- cells (EPI-illumination microscopy), as well as their plasma membranes (total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, TIRFM), were performed. Additionally, generalized polarization (GP) measurements of CHO-WT and CHO-NPC1-/- cells incubated with the fluorescence marker laurdan were performed to determine membrane stiffness of plasma- and intracellular-membranes. CHO-NPC1-/- cells showed higher membrane stiffness at intracellular- but not plasma-membranes, equivalent to cholesterol accumulation in late endosomes/lysosomes. Along with higher membrane stiffness, the FRET efficiency between BACE1-GFP and APP-mRFP was reduced at intracellular membranes, but not within the plasma membrane of CHO-NPC1-/-. Our data show that FRET combined with TIRF is a powerful technique to determine protein proximity and membrane fluidity in cellular models of neurodegenerative diseases.

23626867|t|USE OF FUSED CIRCULATIONS TO INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF APOLIPOPROTEIN E AS AMYLOID CATALYST AND PERIPHERAL SINK IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE.
23626867|a|Apolipoprotein E (apoE) synthesized in liver and brain plays a key role in both cholesterol transport and Alzheimer's disease (AD): apoE-knockout mice develop hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis and cannot support AD amyloid deposition. The ApoE4 allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD, and apoE4 protein preferentially catalyzes amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide fibrillization in vitro and amyloid plaque deposition in vivo. Circulating apoE may also have the potential to draw Abeta from the brain and reduce amyloid deposition. We used parabiosis to determine how circulating apoE impacts brain amyloid deposition and blood cholesterol levels in transgenic mice carrying AD-promoting APP and PS1 human transgenes-either with or without the endogenous mouse apoE gene. ApoE transferred through the joined circulations from WT to parabiosed APP+/+,PS1+/-,apoE-KO mice prevented hypercholesterolemia and reduced already low brain amyloid deposition. The findings indicate that apoE synthesis in the brain itself is necessary for amyloid accumulation. Furthermore, plasma apoE can both normalize cholesterol levels in apoE-KO mice and act as a peripheral sink to induce net efflux of Abeta peptide from the brain. The therapeutic implication is that inhibiting Alzheimer's disease neuropathology may be accomplished by either reducing apoE in the brain or increasing apoE in the blood.

24900392|a|In the neuroscience landscape, there is no condition with higher unmet medical and societal need than Alzheimer's disease (AD). There are significant opportunities to improve upon symptomatic treatments in AD, and as yet, there are no treatments to modify (slow, stop, or prevent) underlying disease progression. Our goals are to discover new symptomatic AD therapies with improved efficacy and longevity; to complete definitive studies that refute or prove the amyloid hypothesis, potentially opening multiple avenues to new therapeutic modalities; and to initiate tests of novel mechanisms that can prevent tau pathology and neurodegeneration. It's a critical time in the testing of novel AD therapeutics-let's hope we succeed.

26589074|t|Implicit Solvent Models and Stabilizing Effects of Mutations and Ligands on the Unfolding of the Amyloid beta-Peptide Central Helix.
26589074|a|We have systematically evaluated the ability of molecular dynamics simulation with implicit solvation models (EEF1.1, SASA, ASPENR, SCPISM, RUSH, ACE2, GBORN, GBSW, GBMV II, FACTS) to characterize the unfolding of the amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide and the stabilizing effects of mutations and ligands. The 13-26 region of Abeta (Abeta13-26) unfolds and leads to the formation of amyloid fibrils, the causative agent of Alzheimer's disease. Stabilization of Abeta13-26 decreases Abeta polymerization as well as the formation of intermediate structures, which may also be toxic. The unfolding behavior of wild-type Abeta13-26 with an increase in temperature led us to select GBORN, GBMV II, and SCPISM for further investigation considering their ability to reproduce the stabilizing effect on the Abeta13-26 helical conformation due to mutations (V18A/F19A/F20A and V18L/F19L/F20L) and ligands (Dec-DETA and Pep1b) designed to stabilize Abeta13-26. Structural parameters (RMSD, helicity) of the peptide were used to assess the performance of the implicit solvent models with reference to previous explicit solvent simulations.
